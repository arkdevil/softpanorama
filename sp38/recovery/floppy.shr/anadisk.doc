 Overview

 AnaDisk is a utility for examining,  editing and  analyzing  dis-
 kettes.  It performs the following functions:

      *	   Analyze diskettes for content and consistency.  The den-
	   sity	 and  format of diskettes are automatically deter-
	   mined;  any format changes or media errors  are  noted.
	   In the case of DOS diskettes, checks are made to ensure
	   that	 a  diskette  complies with generally accepted DOS
	   implementation practice.

      *	   Search diskettes for text.	 Both  case-sensitive  and
	   case-insensitive searches may be performed,	as well as
	   search keys with "wild card" or "don't care" positions.
	   Both the active data areas,	as well as the inactive or
	   erased data areas may be searched.

      *	   Examine and print data on a physical sector, as well as
	   on a file basis.   Either ASCII or hexadecimal displays
	   may be used.

      *	   Copy a diskette without regard to format or type.

      *	   Modify data on a diskette.

      *	   Repair DOS diskettes containing data errors.

      *	   Format a diskette according to custom specifications.

      *	   Copy an area of a diskette to a DOS file.

 AnaDisk features a menu-driven "windowed" presentation.    Exten-
 sive context-sensitive on-line help is available.

 AnaDisk requires an IBM PC or PS/2 compatible computer for opera-
 tion.	Certain computers, such as the Tandy 1000, 2000 or the IBM
 PC Jr., are not sufficiently compatible to support AnaDisk.

 At  least  512K  of  memory  and  a hard disk are recommended for
 AnaDisk operation, although some function may be obtained with as
 little as 384K on a diskette-only system.


 Installing AnaDisk

 The software for AnaDisk is  contained	 in  two  programs.    The
 first,	 the  installation  program,  called ADINSTAL,	is used to
 determine the diskette configuration of the computer being  used.
 This  installation  program  modifies	the second part,  the file
 ANADISK.EXE, with the diskette configuration information.

 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
		  AnaDisk INSTALLATION PROGRAM Ver. 2.01

	       Copyright 1989, Sydex.  All Rights Reserved.


 This program installs AnaDisk.

 Installation is a one-time task; you should not need to re-run this
 program unless you have changed your equipment configuration.

 Installation may be performed with a single diskette, or any combination
 of diskettes and hard disks.  The most common installation is from a dis-
 kette to a hard disk.	During this installation, you will be asked to
 provide a copy of the AnaDisk files.  If you don't have these files,
 press ESCape to exit now.  This installation procedure selects diskette
 drive types and processor type.  In addition, the installed AnaDisk is
 copied to a destination drive of your choice.



 If you do not wish to install AnaDisk at this time, press ESCape.  Press
 any other key to continue...

 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

		 Figure 1: ADINSTAL Opening Screen

 AnaDisk must be installed prior  to  use.    After  installation,
 AnaDisk  need not be re-installed unless the configuration of the
 computer being used is changed.   It is possible to re-install an
 already installed copy of AnaDisk.

 To install AnaDisk, first load DOS.  Insert the AnaDisk distribu-
 tion  diskette	 into diskette drive A:,  then enter the following
 command:

	   A:ADINSTAL		    and press the ENTER key.

 The display in Figure 1 will appear.  Press the ENTER key to con-
 tinue with the installation process.

 Prompts will appear for the source and destination  disk  drives.
 AnaDisk may be re-installed over itself,  if need be.	Otherwise,
 the source copy of AnaDisk is not modified  by	 the  installation
 software.

 After AnaDisk has been read from the specified source drive,  the
 display in Figure 2 appears.  ADINSTAL groups PC-Compatibles into
 those having a PC XT-type of architecture,  or those having a	PC
 AT-type.    However,  this  division  is  not always clear,  par-
 ticularly in the case of an XT-class  PC  with	 an  add-in  high-

			      Page 2




 density  diskette controller.	 These are provided by a number of
 vendors for enhancement purposes,  and	 their	presence  requires
 that the PC be declared as an AT-style computer.

 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

 Although your computer may be an XT-type system, you may wish to force it
 to be treated as an AT-class machine if you have a high-density diskette
 controller.

 On the other hand, if you are using a Toshiba 3100, you probably need to
 indicate that it's an XT-type machine to get the diskette drives to
 operate correctly.

 You have a PC AT, IBM PS/2 or compatible.


 Is this correct? (Y or N)


 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
	       Figure 2: ADINSTAL Computer Selection

 If permitted, ADINSTAL will attempt to determine the diskette con-
 figuration  of the computer.	In any case,  a display similar to
 the following screen (Figure 3) is shown:

 Information contained on this display may be  changed	until  the
 data  reflects	 the  actual  configuration  of the host computer.
 DRIVE is used by AnaDisk to refer to a diskette drive.	  While it
 is  advisable	that  the drive letter be the same as that used by
 DOS to refer to that drive, any letter can be used.   UNIT refers
 to  the physical unit number of a drive.   Some diskette adapters
 are able to access only two  drives,  physical	 units	0  and	1.
 Other adapters,  particularly those of the XT variety, can access
 up to four drives, physical units 0, 1, 2 and 3.

 If a second diskette adapter has been added to the host computer,
 it will be necessary to configure units attached to that  adapter
 as  Secondary.	  Note that,  on secondary adapters,  the physical
 unit numbering starts over again with unit 0.	 It will be neces-
 sary  to specify the base I/O port address of this adapter;  most
 comon adapters use 0370 as the secondary base address.	  The dis-
 kette adapter manufacturer's reference material should be checked
 to verify this, however.

 The  drive  step  rate	 refers	 to  how  quickly  the positioning
 mechanism in a drive is able to move the  read/write  heads  from
 cylinder  to cylinder.	  In almost all instances of 5.25" drives,
 the default of 6 milliseconds will be satisfactory.   This  value
 sometimes  needs  to  changed	for  some of the older 8" diskette
 drives.

 AnaDisk does not explicitly support dual-speed 5.25" drives.    A
 dual-speed  drive  is	one  that rotates the media at 300 RPM for
 low-density recording and 360 RPM for high-density recording.	If
 it is desired to use a dual-speed drive,  it must be declared	as
 two  separate	drives,	 a  high-density drive,	 and a low-density
 drive, using two different drive letters.

 After the diskette drives have been configured for  AnaDisk,  the
 installed  program  file  is written to the specified destination
 path and drive, and AnaDisk is ready for use.


 Running AnaDisk

 To start AnaDisk, simply enter the following at the DOS prompt:

	   ANADISK

 and press the ENTER key.   AnaDisk will normally adjust its video
 display  routines  to	make  use  of  the display adapter in use.
 However,  if the display adapter is of a color type and the  dis-
 play monitor itself is monochrome,  it will be necessary to start
 AnaDisk with the following command to get a readable display:

	   ANADISK  M


			      Page 4




 AnaDisk has many displays and functions,  but there  are  certain
 keys which always have the same effect during AnaDisk operation:

      F1   is the Help key.  It may be pressed any time additional
	   information is required.   The help displays in AnaDisk
	   can be characterized as being Context-Sensitive.   That
	   is,	only information relevant to the current operation
	   is presented.   For example,	 if AnaDisk were prompting
	   for	a  file	 name,	F1  would  produce  a display that
	   presented information about the application of the file
	   being requested.

      ESCape is the Exit key.	It may be pressed at any  time	to
	   terminate the operation in progress.	  Unless otherwise
	   noted,  pressing ESCape will cause AnaDisk to return to
	   the	display that preceded the current one.	 If ESCape
	   is pressed a sufficient number of times,  AnaDisk  will
	   exit to DOS.

 When an abnormal condition has been detected in AnaDisk,  a small
 window describing the condition will  appear.	  This	window	is
 referred to as the "Alert Box":

		  ╔════════<>^v to Move══════════╗
		  ║ Drive A: is not ready.	 ║
		  ║ Please correct and press	 ║
		  ║ any key to continue.	 ║
		  ║				 ║
		  ║				 ║
		  ╚══════════════════════════════╝

 The Alert Box may be moved around the screen by means of the cur-
 sor keys.   Up- and down-cursor move the Alert Box up or down one
 character row,	 respectively.	 Right-	 and  left-cursor  have	 a
 similar  effect.    The Home key moves the Alert Box to the upper
 left corner of the display; End moves it to the lower left.  PgUp
 moves the Alert Box to the upper right corner of the display  and
 PgDn moves it to the lower right.

 After AnaDisk is loaded by DOS,  the following display (Figure 4)
 appears:

 If the ESCape key is pressed,	AnaDisk exits to DOS.	Otherwise,
 the  cursor  right-  and left- arrow keys are used to position to
 highlight,  and thereby select,  the desired function.	  After	 a
 function  has been selected,  pressing the ENTER key will cause a
 menu specific to the particular function to be displayed.

 The functions performed by AnaDisk are as follows:

      The Scan function reads an entire diskette  and  points  out
	   any problems or inconsistencies.  A quick look is taken
	   at all of the files on the diskette and checks are made
	   to  ensure  that  file contents are consistent with the
	   file type.  A "log" of the activity can be printed,	if
	   desired.

      Sectors provides a diskette editing function, operating on a
	   sector-by-sector basis.   Diskette data can be printed,
	   displayed or changed.

      Files provides a facility to examine file data on the  basis
	   of file name,  rather than physical diskette sector ad-
	   dresses.   It is possible to "walk" the directory  tree
	   and print or display file data.



			      Page 6




      Search provides a facility to search for data on a diskette.
	   A  number  of  search  key  values can be specified and
	   these may contain "wild-card" or "don't  care"  values.
	   The results of the search can be displayed or printed.

      Copy  provides  a	 disk-to-disk copying function.	  A "true"
	   copy of an  entire  diskette	 is  produced  within  the
	   limits of the PC diskette adapter hardware.	 It is not
	   necessary to pre-format the target diskette,	 but it is
	   advisable to write-protect the source diskette.

      Repair  scans a DOS diskette for data errors and attempts to
	   mitigate their effect by "moving" the contents  of  er-
	   roneous sectors to other areas of the diskette.

      FAT provides a DOS File Allocation Table editor.

      Format  supplies	a  custom  diskette formatting capability.
	   This is a feature intended for advanced users.

      Dump copies specified areas of a diskette	 to  a	DOS  file.
	   The diskette being copied need not be a DOS diskette.

 As is the case throughout AnaDisk, help may be obtained by press-
 ing F1.

 Scan Operation

 When the Scan function is selected, the display shown in Figure 5
 appears.  The choice for each item in the menu can be selected by
 positioning the highlighted area using the right- and left-cursor
 keys.	The up- and down-cursor keys select the desired menu item.
 When  the  desired  selections	 have been made,  the ENTER key is
 pressed to begin processing Scan mode.

 The Scan function reads an entire diskette and attempts  to  dis-
 cover	data errors or inconsistencies.	  AnaDisk first determines
 the layout of cylinders,  tracks and sectors,	then  attempts	to
 classify the diskette according to operating system type.  If the
 diskette  appears to have a DOS format,  a validity check is made
 of the File Allocation Table (FAT).  Finally, every sector of the
 diskette is read, and errors and format changes noted.

 A normal Scan function operating display is shown  in	Figure	6.
 The  "thermometer  bar"  across  the  top of the screen indicates
 where AnaDisk is positioned on the diskette.	The small arrow on
 the  display points down if the first side of a diskette is being
 accessed,  or up for the second side.	 In addition,  position is
 also shown in the small window in the upper-left part of the dis-
 play.	A progress message is displayed in the small window in the
 upper-right part of the display.

 The  window labeled GENERAL contains information about the static
 or unchanging aspects of the diskette under examination,  such as
 number	 of  sectors  per track and File Allocation Table informa-
 tion.	 The window labeled ANALYSIS describes events of a dynamic
 nature,  such as read errors and anomalies in diskette structure.
 This window uses a scrolling display; that is, the oldest informa-
 tion is replaced by the newest.

 For DOS diskettes with readable file allocation information,  the
 lower	part  of the GENERAL window presents the data contained in
 the File Allocation Table (FAT) on the diskette.

 If Pause after anomalies on the Scan menu is selected, some infor-
 mation is presented by opening an additional window  which  over-
 lays the display and temporarily suspends AnaDisk operation until
 acknowledged from the keyboard.   If Pause after anomalies is not
 selected,  important information is written in the ANALYSIS  win-
 dow, but operation of AnaDisk is not suspended.

 If Printer output is selected, a running log of analysis informa-
 tion is printed on the default printer (the DOS PRN: device).

 One of the items of information that AnaDisk displays during Scan
 operation is shown in Figure 7.  This shows information contained
 in the first sector of a DOS diskette, which will be used in per-
 forming file structure analysis of the diskette.

 If  the  number of sides declared by the DOS Boot Sector does not
 match that actually detected by AnaDisk,  one	of  the	 following
 Alert Box messages appears:

      This is a double-sided DOS	This is a single-sided DOS
      format, but only one side		format, but both sides
      has data.	 Press any key		have data.  Do you want to
      to resume...			check both sides (Y or N)?

 The Scan function can detect media errors.  A few of the more com-
 mon error messages displayed in the ANALYSIS window are:

			    Data Error

 Meaning:  Information has been read from the diskette, but inter-
 nal  checks  made by the controller indicate that the data trans-
 ferred is suspect.

		       ID but no Data Found

 Meaning:  The marker identifying the beginning	 of  a	sector	is
 present, but not the marker that signifies that data follows.	No
 data is transferred by the diskette controller.
			  Sector Missing
			 Gap in Addresses

 Meaning:   In DOS diskettes,  sectors are numbered consecutively.
 This message indicates that one or  more  sectors  could  not	be
 found in the normal numbering sequence.  This message can also be
 indicative of some copy-protection schemes.

			 No Data on Track

 Meaning:    The diskette track may be blank or be written in some
 other recording mode,	such as single-density or those modes used
 by  Apple  or	Commodore.   It is not possible to read this track
 with the standard PC-style diskette adapter.


 Edit Sectors Operation

 When the Edit Sectors operation is selected from the  Main  Menu,
 the display shown in Figure 8 appears.





			      Page 10




 The Edit Sectors function provides a facility to inspect,  change
 and print diskette data on a sector-by-sector	  basis,  as  con-
 trasted  with Examine Files,  which implements inspection of data
 within a specified DOS file.

		    Figure 8: Edit Sectors menu

 The Edit Sectors sub-menu provides for the selection  of  a  dis-
 kette unit.

 Like the Scan function, Edit Sectors begins operation by determin-
 ing  the  diskette type and drive characteristics.  After this is
 done, the track and side containing the sector(s) to be inspected
 or modified can be selected.

 The right- and left-cursor keys are used to select the track; the
 up- and down-cursor keys are used to select the head or side con-
 taining the sector.   The "thermometer" line shows this  position
 change	 correspondingly.      When the ENTER key is pressed,  the
 track is read for analysis and a track map is displayed as  shown
 in Figure 9.

 The  desired  sector  is selected from the displayed track map by
 use of the up- and down-cursor keys. When the sector to be edited
 is highlighted,  the ENTER key is pressed to display the data for
 that sector.  If either the right- or left-cursor key is pressed,
 the  next  or	previous track is analyzed,  and the track map for
 that track displayed.	  If the ESCape key  is	 pressed,  AnaDisk
 returns to the track selection display.

	    Figure 11: Mixed Hexadecimal-ASCII display.


 Several function key combinations will specialized functions,	as
 follows:


			      Page 13




 F1   obtains a brief Help display.

 F2   Re-reads the current sector.  This function may be needed if
 data in the sector display has been modified,	and it is  desired
 to bring back the original data.

 F3   Prints  the  current  sector  on the DOS printer (PRN:).	 A
 mixed hexadecimal-ASCII format is used.

 F4   Writes a mixed hexadecimal-ASCII representation of the  sec-
 tor data to a standard DOS file.  If the DOS file exists prior to
 the  F4  operation,  the data is appended to the end of the file.
 Otherwise, a new file is created.

 F5   Shifts the data from the current (highlighted)  position	to
 the  end  of  the  sector one bit left.   Bits shifted out of the
 high-order positions of the current byte are lost; low order posi-
 tions at the end of the current sector are filled with zero.

 F6   Shifts the data from the current (highlighted)  position	to
 the  end  of  the sector one bit right.   Bits shifted out of the
 low-order positions of the last byte  in  the	sector	are  lost;
 high-order  bit  positions  at	 the  current byte are filled with
 zero.	  The  shift-right  and	 -left	functions  are	useful	in
 reconstructing	 information  in a sector which has become garbled
 because of a data read error.

 F7   Performs the one's complement Boolean  operation  on  sector
 data  from  the  current (highlighted) position to the end of the
 sector.

 F8   Toggles  the  display  mode  from	 ASCII	to  mixed   ASCII-
 hexadecimal.

 F9   Reads the sector immediately preceding the current one.	If
 the current sector is the first on the track, F9 re-reads the cur-
 rent sector.

 F10  Reads the sector immediately following the current one.	If
 the current sector is the last on the track, F10 re-reads the cur-
 rent sector.

 Shift-F2  Performs  a "diagnostic read" of the current track.	 A
 diagnostic read involves reading the data field of the first sec-
 tor and continues with all fields until 16,384	 bytes	have  been
 read.	  ID fields, gap bytes and CRCs are read indiscriminately;
 no attempt to re-synchronize the  data	 discrimination	 logic	is
 made after the first sector has been read.   This function allows
 viewing of raw data and may be used to determine the value  of	 a
 data field whose address ID field has been corrupted, or data con-
 tained within inter-sector gaps.   See the Diskette Tutorial sec-
 tion for more information.

			      Page 14





 Shift-F3 Identifies the file of which the sector is a part.  Note
 that is function is available only for DOS diskettes.

 Shift-F4 Saves the contents of the sector in an internal  buffer.
 Each  time  Shift-F4  is depressed,  the previous contents of the
 save buffer are lost.

 Shift-F5 Recalls the contents of the save buffer to  the  current
 display.  Note that the contents of the buffer are not written to
 the diskette.

 Shift-F6 Fills the sector from the current position to the end of
 the sector with the value at the current position.

 Shift-F9  Analyzes the preceding track and displays the track map
 for it.  If the current track is the first on the diskette, it is
 re-read.

 Shift-F10 Analyzes the following track and displays the track map
 for it.

 Alt-F2	   Writes the contents of the editing display back to  the
 diskette.

 Alt-F3	   First reads all sectors on the current track,  then re-
 formats the current track with a fresh format pattern,	 then  re-
 writes the sectors back to the track.	 A display requesting con-
 firmation appears before the track is reformatted.

 ESCape Returns to the track map for this track.


 In addition to this information,  the menu window also shows  the
 current  sector,  the	position within the sector in both decimal
 and hexadecimal and the following flags, if applicable:

	ERR	The  sector  could  not	 be  read  without  error.
	   Before an attempt is made to read a sector, the data is
	   set	to all zero.   If the error is one that results in
	   no data being transferred,  the display will	 show  all
	   zero.

      CTL  MK  A  Deleted Data ID Address Mark was detected on the
	   current sector.   DOS makes no use of this feature  and
	   never  writes  this	flag,  but AnaDisk does detect its
	   presence and reports it.

 Examine Files

 The Examine Files function provides for examination of data  con-
 tained	 in DOS files.	 After the Examine Files function has been
 selected from the Main Menu,  the diskette unit to be examined is
 selected from a subsidiary menu similar to that used for Edit Sec-
 tors.

 The main Examine Files display presents a list of file names con-
 tained	 in the root directory of a diskette.	The cursor up- and
 down-arrow keys are used to select the highlighted file or direc-
 tory name to be examined; the file name display can be "paged" by
 means of the Page Up (PgUp) or Page Down (PgDn) keys.	 Figure 12
 shows a sample display.

	   In  the  window displaying file names,  the meanings of
		the column labels are as follows:

		NAME is the name of the file.

		ATTRIB show flags for the file attributes.   These
			  are as follows:

		     A	is the "archive" flag.	 This flag is used
			       by back-up  utilities  and  is  set
			       whenever	 the  file  is	created or
			       modified.   Most back-up	 utilities
			       clear  this  flag once the file has
			       been backed up.

		     D is the "directory" flag.	 When this flag is
			       present, the name shown is the name
			       of a directory, rather than a file.

		     V is the "volume label" flag.  When this flag
			       is  present,  the name shown is the
			       name of the volume label	 for  this
			       diskette.  This name can be changed
			       by means of the DOS LABEL utility.

		     H	is  the "hidden" flag.	 When this flag is
			       present,	 the file name will not be
			       shown in a DOS directory listing.

		     R is the "read only" flag.	 When this flag is
			       set,  DOS  will not permit the file
			       to be written to.    This  flag	is
			       modified by means of the DOS ATTRIB
			       command.

		     S	is  the "system" flag.	 This flag is nor-
			       mally  only  associated	with   DOS
			       files loaded at system "boot" time.
			       Files  flagged  with this attribute
			       are also implicitly  read-only  and
			       hidden (R and H attributes).

 To examine the files in a particular subdirectory,  highlight the
 subdirectory name and press ENTER.   To go  back  to  the  parent
 directory of a subdirectory,  position to the ..  entry and press
 ENTER.

 Several functions are available on the Examine Files menu:

      F1   obtains a brief Help display.



			      Page 17




      F2   causes the Edit Sectors display to be activated,  using
	   the	first  sector  of  the current (highlighted) file.
	   All functions on the Edit  Sectors  menu  operate  nor-
	   mally, with the following exceptions:

	   F9	moves one sector back within the file.

	   F10	moves one sector forward within the file.

	   Shift-F9 and Shift-F10 do nothing.

	   ESCape  returns  to the Examine Files menu,	not to the
		track map.

	   In addition,	 the relative byte offset within the  file
	   is displayed, in addition to the cylinder, side and sec-
	   tor.

      F3   displays  the currently highlighted file as ASCII text.
	   The cursor-up, cursor-down,	PgUp,  PgDn,  Home and End
	   keys may be used to navigate within a file.	 Data past
	   the end-of-file point is displayed following the  nota-
	   tion:

			    >>> END-OF-FILE <<<

      F4   toggles  the	 file directory display between Active and
	   Deleted or erased files.   A deleted file always has	 a
	   "sigma" as the first character of the name.	 Figure 13
	   shows a deleted files display.

      F5   causes the currently highlighted file to be printed	as
	   ASCII  text.	   Data past the end-of-file point is also
	   printed,  with the end-of-file shown as in the F3 func-
	   tion, above.

      F6   causes  the currently highlighted file to be printed as

 It is possible to display and print  data  belonging  to  deleted
 files,	 if the file has not already been overwritten.	 If an at-

 plays information as if the file were not overwritten.	 To gather
 data for display, AnaDisk searches (forward) for the next unallo-

 Search

 AnaDisk's  Search function will examine a diskette for a match on
 any one of a series of search key values,  referred to simply	as
 keys.	The search can extend over the entire diskette, the active
 file area,  or just the deleted (inactive) area.   Up to five 65-
 character keys may be specified; AnaDisk will search for all keys
 simultaneously and report a match on any key.

		      Figure 14: Search Menu.


 Keys may contain what are known as "don't care"  or  "wild  card"
 values, which will match any character.  To obtain the most effi-
 cient	performance,  a	 key  should not begin with a "don't care"
 value.	  In addition,	the search may be instructed to ignore the
 case of alphabetic data; e.g., the letter A will match both a and
 A.

 The  Search  menu  is shown in Figure 14.   The Source for search
 value selection offers two alternatives:



			      Page 20




      KEYBOARD specifies key entry from the keyboard.	After  all
	   key values are entered, they may be saved to a file for
	   later recall.

      OLD VALUES specifies that the keys entered for the preceding
	   search should be used.   This option is invalid for the
	   first search of a AnaDisk session.


 Search alpha case-sensitive specifies whether the  search  should
 consider  the case of alphabetic characters.	If NO is selected,
 the search considers both upper- and lower-case alphabetic charac-
 ters to be equivalent.	 Thus,	DOG will match both DOG and dog if
 the search is not case-sensitive.

 Search	 what  part of the disk?  offers three alternatives.   The
 first,	 ALL,  specifies that the entire disk should  be  searched
 without  regard  to  file boundaries or use of a sector.   ACTIVE
 specifies that only the data areas belonging to  files	 or  their
 directories be searched;  non-active (deleted or free) data areas
 will not be searched.	DELETED specifies that only the deleted or
 unallocated areas of the disk should be examined.

 Print hits without pausing instructs AnaDisk to record all search
 matches on the printer without stopping for verification.    Nor-
 mally,	 AnaDisk opens a window when a match is found, as shown in
 Figure 16, and requests further direction.

 Masked Search refers to the optional specification  of	 an  8-bit
 hexadecimal quantity which determines which bits in a byte are to
 be taken into consideration when a comparison is made.	  Each bit
 in the mask quantity that contains  a	"0"  represents	 a  "don't
 care"  position.   That is,  bits in these positions will have no
 effect on the outcome of a comparison.	   Conversely,	those  bit
 positions  containing "1" bits will be considered in comparisons.
 A mask quantity of all zeroes would represent no significant posi-
 tions and so will not be allowed by AnaDisk.

 When search keys are to be entered from the keyboard, the display
 in Figure 15 appears.	 Key values up to 65 characters may be en-
 tered;	 "don't  care" values may be specified by the key combina-
 tion Alt-X.   "Don't care" values will appear as highlighted  in-
 verted question marks.

 Data entry may be performed in either ASCII or hexadecimal modes.
 Initially,  data entry begins in ASCII mode;  the Tab key is used
 to alternate between modes and may be used at any time.   Regard-
 less of the mode used to enter search values, an appropriate rep-
 resentation  appears  in both the ASCII and the hexadecimal parts
 of the display as the values are entered.

 part of a verbatim sequence,  ESCape terminates  data	entry  and
 return is made to the Main Menu.

 Both  the cursor-left and the backspace keys may be used to erase
 the most recently typed character.   When a  key  has	been  com-

 After	obtaining  the	search	keys,  AnaDisk reads each diskette
 track and searches it for a match on each key	value  in  succes-
 sion.	If a matching value crosses (or "straddles") a track bound-
 ary,  AnaDisk	will  report  the  value as occurring on the lower
 track.	 If a match is located, AnaDisk will then report the match
 if it occurs within the area of the disk that has been	 specified
 for searching, i.e., ALL, ACTIVE or DELETED.

 It  is important to observe that AnaDisk searches the diskette in
 physical sector order;	 that is,  the first sector of	the  first
 side of the first cylinder to the last sector of the last side of
 the  last cylinder,  which is not necessarily the way data is or-
 ganized within a given file.

 Unless Print hits without pausing has been selected,  each  match
 is reported as shown in Figure 16.  The value of the matching key
 is  also displayed.   If any positions of the key were entered in
 hexadecimal mode,  the key will be displayed in hexadecimal nota-
 tion.	Otherwise, the key will be displayed in ASCII.

 When  a  match	 "hit"	is  displayed,	four actions are possible,
 depending on the character entered from the keyboard:

      1.   If ESCape is pressed, the search terminates and AnaDisk
	   exits to the main menu display.

      2.   If E is pressed, the sector in which the match occurred
	   is displayed with the Edit Sectors display.	 If ESCape
	   is pressed while in this display,  AnaDisk exits to the
	   match screen (Figure 16).

      3.   If C is pressed,  the search continues  with	 the  next
	   character after the data causing the match.

      4.   If S is pressed, the remainder of the track is skipped,
	   and searching resumes with the data on the next track.


 Copy Diskette

 The  Copy  Diskette function performs a diskette-to-diskette copy
 operation.   Within the limits of PC hardware,	 an exact copy	of
 the original is made.	This is the only instance in which AnaDisk
 can be used to write a diskette.

 It  is strongly recommended that ALL original diskettes used with
 AnaDisk be write-protected!   It is most important,  however,	to
 observe  this	precaution when performing the Copy Diskette func-
 tion;	a brief mental lapse or distraction could  result  in  the
 original diskette being written.

		  Figure 17: Copy Diskette Menu.


 Diskettes can be copied using either one diskette drive, in which
 case diskette "swaps" will be required, or with two drives.  If a
 two-drive  copy is performed,	the drives being used must both be
 capable of supporting the format being copied.	  It is	 not  pos-
 sible, for example, to copy a 3.5" 720K diskette to a target in a
 5.25" 360K drive.   Should this be attempted,  the following mes-
 sage appears:

		 ╔════════<>^v to Move══════════╗

		 ║  is incompatible with the	║
		 ║  destination type.  Press	║
		 ║  any key for Main Menu...	║
		 ║				║
		 ╚══════════════════════════════╝

 Because the diskette drives specified are unsuited for	 the  par-
 ticular  copy operation,  AnaDisk exits to the Main Menu in order
 that a new drive selection can be made.

 The operation of the Copy Diskette function  is  straightforward.
 The  source  diskette is analyzed,  track by track,  and the data
 read from the source is accumulated in PC main memory.	  When	no
 more  data can be stored,  the accumulated information is written
 to the destination diskette.	Each track of data that	 has  been


			      Page 25




 written  is verified by reading the data back.	  The process con-
 tinues until there is no more data to be copied.    Progress  and
 error messages are displayed in the ANALYSIS window.

 Not  all  diskettes  can  be  copied faithfully by AnaDisk,  par-
 ticularly diskettes containing copy protection information  writ-
 ten by specialized equipment,	or diskettes that have been physi-
 cally modified (e.g.,	a hole burned by  laser	 on  a	particular
 track).   Nor can diskettes that have been written by some non-PC
 compatible systems, such as the Apple Macintosh,  be copied using
 AnaDisk.


 Repair

 The  Repair  function will operate with DOS diskettes only.   The
 diskette is scanned for data errors;  any part of a file or  sub-
 directory  containing	errors is moved to a free area on the dis-
 kette and the original sectors marked as flawed in the	 file  al-
 location table.  The data as read from the sectors containing the
 error is copied as read;  note that this data may contain errors.
 The sectors containing the original data are left undisturbed.

 After the Repair function has been selected from the  Main  Menu,
 the  diskette	unit  containing  the  diskette	 to  be scanned is
 selected.   A printer "log" of the repair activity  may  also	be
 selected, if desired.

 AnaDisk  then	enters	Scan  mode.    When a sector read error is
 detected,  the display shown  in  figure  18  appears.	 If  E	is
 pressed,  the	sector containing the error will be displayed with
 the Sector Edit display.   It may then be possible to correct the
 error	by rewriting the sector.   If M is pressed,  the data from
 the diskette will be moved as read to a free area of the diskette
 and the File Allocation Table (FAT) adjusted accordingly.  If ES-
 Cape is pressed, the error is left as-is, and the scan for errors
 continues.

 If the error occurs in a immovable area of the diskette,  such as
 the  root  directory or FAT,  the M option will not be displayed.
 In this case,	it will	 be  necessary	to  reconstruct	 the  data
 manually.

 Before	 attempting  a Repair operation,  it is strongly suggested
 that a backup copy of the diskette be made with  the  Copy  func-
 tion.	Additionally, it should be noted that attempting to repair
 a  diskette  in a 1.2M drive which was written using a 360K drive
 may result in a diskette that is  unreadable  in  a  360K  drive.
 AnaDisk will request confirmation before proceeding with a repair
 of this type.

 FAT Editor

 AnaDisk  provides  a  facility for displaying and editing the DOS
 File Allocation Table,	 or FAT,  on a diskette.   After FAT  edit
 mode is selected from the Main Menu, the drive containing the dis-
 kette	to be edited is selected.   If the diskette being examined
 has a valid File Allocation Table,  a	display	 similar  to  that
 shown in Figure 19 appears.

 The FAT describes how the groups of sectors, or Clusters, are put
 together.   Every file directory entry contains the number of the
 first cluster for a file.   If a file is less than one cluster in
 length,  the  entry for that cluster will contain the value 4095,
 signifying the end of the cluster list.   If the file	is  larger
 than one cluster,  however,  each cluster in the FAT will "point"
 to the next one, forming a chain of clusters.

		   Figure 19: FAT Editor Display


 Certain FAT values have certain meanings.  The first value in the
 FAT is simply used to identify the FAT type;  the  second  always
 has the value 4095.   A value of 4087 indicates that a block con-
 tains	an error--this is almost always set by the FORMAT program.
 A value of 0 specifies a "free" or unallocated cluster.

 The cursor may be moved about the editing display,  the up- down-
 right-	 and  left-cursor  keys and the PgUp and PgDn keys perform
 the navigation.   In addition,	 the following function keys  have
 special meaning:

      F1   Produces a help display.
      F2   Produces  a Sector Edit display for the currently high-
	   lighted cluster.
      F3   Identifies the file to which the currently  highlighted
	   cluster belongs.
      F4   Rewrites  the modified FAT to a diskette.   AnaDisk re-
	   quests confirmation before writing, however.
      F5   Allows  a  new  value  for  the  currently  highlighted
	   cluster to be entered.


			      Page 28




      F6   Reads  the FAT from a diskette.   Any changes that were
	   made to the displayed FAT are lost.
      F7   Toggles between a hexadecimal and decimal display.
      ESC  Returns to the main menu.  Any changes made to the dis-
	   played FAT are lost.

 AnaDisk performs a few checks on the value entered  when  the	F5
 function is selected.	The value must lie within the range of al-
 locatable  clusters for the diskette and not be already allocated
 to some other file.


 Custom Format Design

 AnaDisk provides a custom format design  facility  which  may	be
 used  to  produce formatted diskettes for non-DOS computers or to
 design a rudimentary "copy-protection" method.	  AnaDisk's custom
 formatting  function  is  not	intended  for use by beginners;	 a
 detailed knowledge of diskette structure is necessary for  effec-
 tive use of this feature.

 After	the  FORMAT function has been selected from the Main Menu,
 the diskette drive containing the diskette  to	 be  formatted	is
 selected.   A display similar to that shown in Figure 20 then ap-
 pears.	  Because of checking that is performed	 by  AnaDisk,  the
 simplest  operation  can be obtained if the following sequence of
 steps is observed:

 To "lay out" a format,	 first select the sector size using the F2
 key; each depression of this key cycles through the allowable sec-
 tor sizes from 128 to 8,192 bytes.   Next, set the recording mode
 (FM or single-density,	 MFM or double-density) using the F5  key.
 Either	 a  high- or low-density data rate should be next selected
 using the F6 key.

 The number of sectors per track are then set using  the  F3  key.
 If  too  many	sectors are specified for the given recording mode
 and density,  the sector count	 will be adjusted to  the  largest
 number of sectors that will fit on the track.

 The  actual starting cylinder is set with F4.	 Note that a high-
 density 1.2M 5.25" is considered to possess 80 cylinders, regard-
 less of  density.    The  cylinder  increment	between	 formatted
 cylinders  is	set  with F8.	The total number of cylinders for-
 matted is set with F9.	  Note that this is  the  total	 count	of
 cylinders  formatted,	and not the highest cylinder number.   The
 side or sides to be formatted is set with F7 and may be  side	0,
 side 1 or both sides.	The F10 key is used to duplicate the previ-
 ous editing display line into the currently highlighted line.

		 Figure 20: Custom Format Display


 By default, sector ID address headers written are as follows:

       ID Cylinder:  Actual cylinder
       ID Head:	     Actual side
       ID Sector:    Starts with 1, increments by 1
       ID Length:    Actual sector length

 These	defaults  should  suffice  for most "normal" applications.
 However, the values for each ID address field may be altered con-
 siderably.

 Each entry in the ID address table shown in the lower part of the
 display can take on the following mathematical representation:

	   value1 op value2 op value3 op value4

 Where each value is either a constant or one of the following spe-
 cial values:




			      Page 30




      Shift-F2 is the number  of  the  actual  cylinder	 currently
		being formatted;  shown as CYL on the editing dis-
		play.
      Shift-F3 is the count of the cylinders that have	been  for-
		matted up to this point; shown as CNT on the edit-
		ing display.
      Shift-F4	is  the	 side  (0 or 1) currently being formatted;
		shown as HD on the editing display.
      Shift-F5 is the number of the current sector on this  track,
		starting with 1;  shown as SCT on the editing dis-
		play.

 Shift-F6 is used to specify a fixed numeric value between  0  and
 255.

 op can be one of the following:

      +	   for addition
      -	   for subtraction
      *	   for multiplication
      /	   for division

 If  a period (.) is entered for op,  the expression is terminated
 at that point.	  Expressions are  evaluated  from  left-to-right;
 results  are  limited to 8 bits (decimal 255).	  Division by zero
 results in zero with no diagnostic. Overflow is ignored.

 For example, suppose it is desired to produce a single-sided for-
 mat where the ID address cylinder field begins with 39	 and  ends
 with  0 at the innermost track.   The expression for the CYLINDER
 field for every sector in the editing display would be:

	   39-CYL

 It should be observed that the Custom Format function only writes
 the format pattern to a diskette.   Other data,  such	as  system
 tables must be written using other means, such as the Sector Edit
 function.  It should be further observed that all sectors written
 by  the  Custom  Format  are of the same size,	 regardless of the
 length specifier in the ID Address header.


 Dump Operation

 The Dump operation writes a specified area of a diskette to a DOS
 file.	 After selecting the Dump option from the Main	Menu,  the
 diskette  drive containing the diskette to be read,  the range of
 cylinders and sides to be written to a	 specified  DOS	 file  are
 selected.

 Each  sector  written	to  the	 file is optionally preceded by an
 8-byte header record of the following form:

			      Page 31





     +------+------+------+------+------+------+----------+
     | ACYL | ASID | LCYL | LSID | LSEC | LLEN |  COUNT	  |
     +------+------+------+------+------+------+----------+

      ACYL	Actual cylinder, 1 byte
      ASID	Actual side, 1 byte
      LCYL	Logical cylinder; cylinder as read, 1 byte
      LSID	Logical side; or side as read, 1 byte
      LSEC	Sector number as read, 1 byte
      LLEN	Length code as read, 1 byte
      COUNT	Byte count of data to follow,  2 bytes.	  If zero,
		no data is contained in this sector.

 All  sectors  occurring  on  a	 side  will  be	 grouped together;
 however,  they will appear in the same order as they occurred	on
 the diskette.	 Therefore, if an 8 sector-per-track diskette were
 scanned which had a physical interleave of 2:1, the sectors might
 appear in the order 1,5,2,6,3,7,4,8 in the DOS dump file.

 After the last specified cylinder has been  written  to  the  DOS
 file, AnaDisk returns to the Main Menu.


 In Conclusion...

 We  believe  that AnaDisk Version 2.0 represents a major improve-
 ment over earlier verisons.  Our list of features yet to be added
 to AnaDisk includes an intelligent file unerase,  save	 and  load
 data to a DOS file--and yes, a hard disk version!

 All  of  which	 is made possible by your support of the Shareware
 concept.   We hope we will continue to be deserving of that  sup-
 port.	  If there is any way in which we can assist you with this
 product, please call or drop us a line.
