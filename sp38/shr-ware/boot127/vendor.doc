          This file  provides information  for disk vendors;  any person or
          organisation distributing software on disks (or through any other
          medium, including  electronic  file transfer)  for a fee  will be
          considered  a disk  vendor  in  this  context.  This  explicitely
          includes commercial and non-profit user group libraries.

          I would be pleased to work with  you because you are an important
          part of the shareware distribution system. However I require that
          you obtain written permission  from me before starting to distri-
          bute  BOOT.SYS.  Together  with the permission  you will  get the
          current version of BOOT.SYS and I will try to keep you up-to-date
          if new versions are released.

          To obtain this permission  please send me a copy of your standard
          written  materials (catalogs/flyers)  which  clearly explain  the
          shareware  concept, the  need for users to register  the products
          they use, and the fact that  the price of your disks is a copying
          fee only and does not constitute  payment for the product. If you
          carry both  shareware and  public domain  software/freeware  then
          your  materials must make a  clear distinction  between these two
          categories. Only  if these basic concepts are  explicitely stated
          in your written materials will I be confident that your customers
          are fully informed about what they are paying for.

          If you are  an Approved  Vendor of  the Association  of Shareware
          Professionals(R) (ASP)  you have my  permission to  start distri-
          buting BOOT.SYS  immediately. However  I still require  getting a
          notification within four weeks stating the following:
            - the fact that you are an  Associate Member of the Association
              of Shareware Professionals
            - the date you started distributing BOOT.SYS
            - the version  of BOOT.SYS you  are distributing  and where you
              got it from
          If you send me a copy  of your catalog, which  includes BOOT.SYS,
          I will automatically send you  the next new version as soon as it
          becomes available.
          Please refer to the file SYSOP.DOC  for a suggested wording for a
          catalog entry.

          I strongly recommend  that you consider  becoming an ASP approved
          vendor if you  have not already  done so. The ASP  vendor program
          reduces the workload for both authors and vendors, and helps give
          customers  confidence  that reasonable  standards are  met in the
          distribution of  shareware products. For more  information on the
          ASP vendor program, contact the ASP at:

               Association of Shareware Professionals
               Vendor Certification Committee
               P.O. Box 5786
               Bellevue, WA 98006
               U. S. A.

          The  right  to  withhold  or  withdraw  permission to  distribute
          BOOT.SYS from anyone  at any time  for any reason  is explicitely
          reserved.

          I realize that this policy creates  additional paperwork for both
          you and me, but  I believe that this is necessary  to protect the
          unsuspecting buyers from  unscrupulous individuals and ensure the
          continued  growth  of the  shareware  market,  and  I am  looking
          forward to hearing from you.
