
Command:

    PKSFANSI


Purpose:

    PKSFANSI (PK Safe ANSI) is a Terminate and Stay Resident program
    that disables ANSI Keyboard Key Reassignments, thereby preventing
    'ANSI bombs' embedded in any text file (such as README files) or
    output by any program.

    Normally, ANSI sequences that redefine the keyboard could be
    hidden inside ANY text file or program, and could be executed
    completely unnoticed until it is too late.  PKSFANSI intercepts
    calls to the ANSI.SYS or other ANSI device drivers, and filters
    out any keyboard reassignments, while allowing other ANSI sequences
    through unaltered.

    If a keyboard key reassignment is attempted, PKSFANSI will
    intercept the sequence and discard it.  PKSFANSI also will BEEP
    to alert you that a reassignment was attempted.

    PKSFANSI requires less than 1000 bytes resident RAM, and should
    work with any ANSI driver, such as the standard ANSI.SYS driver,
    NANSI, ZANSI, DVANSI, etc.  Note that if you use a memory
    resident ANSI driver, such as the DESQview DVANSI.COM driver,
    that PKSFANSI should be loaded after the ANSI driver is loaded.
