                       How to use the F-PROT package

This document includes a description of every program in the package.
Currently the list of files is as follows:

Protection programs

        F-DRIVER.SYS            Monitors against known viruses. This
                                program will stop infected programs,
                                before they are run.
        F-OSCHK.EXE             A checksumming program for the three system
                                files, the boot sector and the partition
                                record. It will detect if the operating
                                system has been attacked by a virus.
        F-LOCK.EXE              Provides protection against unknown
                                viruses and Trojans. It will try to
                                detect any suspicious activity.

Virus identification and removal programs

        F-SYSCHK.EXE            Checks memory for infection by known viruses.
                                It will only find viruses present in memory
                                when it is run. 
        F-FCHK.EXE              Searches for infected files and can remove
                                the infections.
        F-DISINF.EXE            Looks for boot sector infections and
                                can remove them.

Programs for self-checking

        F-XLOCK.EXE             Adds code to executable files, so they
                                will check (when run) if they have been
                                infected. It will not prevent them from
                                being infected, but will detect the
                                virus, the first time they are run
                                afterwards.
        F-UNLOCK.EXE            Removes the code described above.
        F-XCHK.EXE              Only allows programs modified in this way
                                to be run. This provides full protection
                                against all viruses, but can only rarely
                                be used.
        F-RUN.EXE               Used to run unmodified programs, when F-XCHK
                                is active.

Utilities

        F-POPUP.EXE             Pop-Up window program, used by F-LOCK and
                                F-DLOCK.
        F-DLOCK.EXE             Protects the hard disk from writing or
                                formatting.
        F-EX.EXE                Removes the memory-resident programs in
                                this package from memory.
        F-DIR.EXE               Lists hidden or read-only files.
        F-MMAP.EXE              Produces a detailed memory map
        F-HIDE.EXE              Hides files.
        F-UNHIDE.EXE            Unhides files.
        F-BOOT.EXE              Shows the boot sector.
        F-PBR.EXE               Shows the partition boot record.
        F-NET.EXE               "Fix" for users of Novell networks.

Other files

        SIGN.TXT                Virus signature file
        TROJAN.TXT              Trojan signature file


                A short description of each program


------------------------- F-DRIVER.SYS and F-NET.EXE----------------------------

F-DRIVER.SYS is without doubt the most important program in the package.
If you only use a single program from the whole package. it should be
this one.  It will provide full protection against all the viruses listed in
the documentation and is also able to stop some new variants of them.

Since this program is implemented as a device driver, it is not loaded
in the usual way, but rather by placing a command in the CONFIG.SYS file.

                DEVICE=path name of F-DRIVER.SYS
Example:
                DEVICE=\F-PROT\F-DRIVER.SYS

This program only occupies around 4500 bytes of memory.  It has two main
functions.  At boot-up time, it will analyze the memory and interrupt
vectors in order to determine if the computer has been infected with any
boot sector virus.  If so, it will display a warning message and halt the
computer, forcing a reboot from a "clean" diskette.  It must be noted that
this program should also be effective against any new boot sector viruses. 
However, on machines with some Network Boot ROMs, F-driver might warn of a
(non-existing) infection, unless this feature is disabled.  To disable
automatic check of memory on boot time, add a /NOBOOT flag.  Example:

                DEVICE=\F-PROT\F-DRIVER.SYS  /NOBOOT

F-DRIVER will also check each program run for infection by any of the
program viruses it knows of, by searching for virus identification
strings when a program is loaded.  As it recognizes almost all known viruses,
this will provide a high degree of security.  If an attempt is made to run an
infected program, F-DRIVER will display a warning message like

        "This program is infected with the Cascade virus"

and refuse to allow the program to be run.

F-DRIVER.SYS should not interfere with the execution of any "healthy"
program, but there are a few cases where F-DRIVER will not provide 
protection.  If you are for example using a Novell network or PC-NFS, the
network driver will take over the "execute" function, disabling the
checking done by F-DRIVER.  In order to close this "hole", the F-NET.EXE
program is provided.

To determine if you need to use it, do the following:

	1) Place a command in CONFIG.SYS to load F-DRIVER
	2) Reboot the computer.
	3) Run the program F-TEST.COM, both locally and over the network.
	   It is NOT a virus, but should be stopped by F-DRIVER in the same
	   way as known viruses.  You should get a message saying:

			This program is Infected by the F-TEST virus.
	   
           If you do, don't panic - everything is as it should be.
        4) If F-TEST.COM is not stopped by F-DRIVER, it will display a
           message saying that F-DRIVER is not installed or not working.
           If this happens, try running F-NET.EXE and then run F-TEST
	   again.
	5) If F-TEST is stopped after you run F-NET, you need to place
	   a command in AUTOEXEC.BAT to run F-NET after you run the
           network software.
        6) If F-TEST is not stopped, after you run F-NET, please let me
	   know.

---------------------------------- F-OSCHK ---------------------------------- 

F-OSCHK is a program that computes a checksum for the three operating
system files.  The names of those files depend on the operating system
used:

        PC-DOS                    MS-DOS                   DR-DOS        

        IBMBIO.COM                IO.SYS                   DRBIOS.COM
        IBMDOS.COM                MSDOS.SYS                DRBDOS.COM
        COMMAND.COM               COMMAND.COM              COMMAND.COM

F-OSCHK can also handle some obscure variants of DOS, like ERSDOS and
P16DOS.

The first two files are normally hidden.  When F-OSCHK is run with no
parameters it will look for those files.  

Example:                F-OSCHK

It assumes the first two files are in the root directory of the current
drive, and that the COMSPEC environment variable contains the location of
the COMMAND.COM program.  The program will then compute checksums for the
three files and display the numbers.  It will also compute checksums for
the boot sector and the partition record - a total of five numbers.

When F-OSCHK is then run with these five numbers as arguments, it will
compare them to the checksums of the programs.  You should first run
F-OSCHK with no arguments and then place a command like

                F-OSCHK 16199 29540 31529 42323 23945

in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  Just use the numbers that are produced on your
own computer instead of those shown here.  If you do not want the program
to verify some of the checksums, you can simply replace them by the
string "-----". Example:

                F-OSCHK 16199 29540 31529 42323 -----

This will tell F-OSCHK not to check the partition record - useful if
it is constantly being changed.


----------------------------- F-LOCK and F-POPUP ------------------------------

F-LOCK provides protection against the attacks of unknown viruses and
Trojans.  It will monitor all activity and take action in the following cases:

        *       When an attempt is made to format a diskette.  It should
                be almost impossible to format hard disks with F-PROT
                installed.
                
        *       When an attempt is made to make a read-only executable
                file read-write.

        *       When an attempt is made to bypass the file system with
                INT 13, INT 40 or INT 26 calls.

        *       When an attempt is made to write to the boot sector.

        *       When a program tries to delete or write to another
                program.

        *       When a program tries to perform a "rename" operation
                where one of the arguments is .EXE or .COM.

In those cases, a pop-up window will appear if F-POPUP is installed,
otherwise the attempted operation will simply fail.  

The window will contain a message, describing the attempted operation,
followed by

                       Allow it (Y/N) (G) ?

Pressing the 'Y' (Yes) key will allow the attempted operation to continue,
but 'N' (No) will cause it to fail.  Pressing the 'G' (Go) key will turn
F-LOCK off while the current program is running.  You should use the 'G' key
when running a program like FORMAT, otherwise you might have to press the
'Y' key several times in a row.

F-LOCK contains one additional feature, that is perhaps the most
important one.  It is the ability to stop programs that try to write to
the disk by jumping directly to the original BIOS routines.  F-LOCK can
for example stop the "fourth method" used by Dr. Solomon in his TRYOUT
program.  

It is not necessary to use F-LOCK and F-POPUP, but they will provide
additional protection against viruses and Trojans.  If you decide to use
F-LOCK and F-POPUP, you should place the following commands in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file, as described in the INSTALL.TXT file.

                        \F-PROT\F-LOCK
                        \F-PROT\F-POPUP

If you use a disk cache program, it is important that is is run before
you run F-LOCK.

F-LOCK may interfere with some legitimate programs:

        Like many other memory resident programs it will not work 
        with Microsoft Windows.

        Some copy-protection methods will not work with F-LOCK installed.
        For example, I am not able to run my copy of Tetris, unless I
        remove F-LOCK from memory.

        The pop-up window will only appear if the screen is in character
        mode.  In bitmap mode, the program will stop, and wait for the
        user to press 'Y', 'N' or 'G'.  Since nothing will be seen on the
        screen, the computer will just appear to "hang".  If you spend
        much time running programs that use bitmap mode, you probably
        should not use F-LOCK.

        The COMP program cannot be used to compare files with names
        ending in .EXE, .COM or .SYS with F-LOCK installed.  Since this
        is a pretty useless program anyhow, I suggest that you just
        obtain a better file comparison utility.


--------------------------------- F-SYSCHK.EXE ---------------------------------

F-SYSCHK checks if the system is infected with any virus it knows.  If an
infection is found, it will be reported, otherwise the following message
will appear:

                              No infection found

The F-SYSCHK program scans the memory for any viral signatures.  This might
take a few minutes on a very slow machine, so it is not recommended to
place a command to run this program in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

To run F-SYSCHK just give the command:

                                   F-SYSCHK

The computer will then be checked for infection by any of the viruses
listed in BOOTVIR.TXT and FILVIR.TXT.  Note that F-SYSCHK uses the file
SIGN.TXT, which must be present in the current directory or in the same
directory as F-SYSCHK.EXE is located in.

F-SYSCHK should be used to ensure that the computer is not infected with
any known virus, before you run the programs F-FCHK and F-DISINF.  The
program will report an infection if it finds the signature string of any
of the viruses it knows anywhere in memory.

Note that the program will only detect if a virus is present in memory
when it is run - if an infected program is run later, it will have no
effect.


---------------------------------- F-FCHK.EXE ----------------------------------

F-FCHK looks for any file infected with known program viruses.  It
recognizes all viruses described in FILVIR.TXT.  It will also find most
mutations of known viruses.  In addition, F-FCHK can also "cure" infected
files in almost all cases.

To use F-FCHK, the file SIGN.TXT must be present in the current directory
or the same directory as F-FCHK.EXE.

To run F-FCHK, simply give a command of the form "F-FCHK <path/file>".  The
specified directory and all subdirectories will then be checked.  Normally
only files with names ending in .COM, .EXE, .OVL, .OVR and .APP will be
tested for infection.  If you add /ALL to the command, every file will be
checked.  For example, the following command will check every file on drive C:

                        F-FCHK C:\  /ALL

Normally you should not waste time using the /ALL command, unless you
know there are infected programs on the disk and you want to make sure
that the virus is not hiding in some obscure overlay file somewhere.

If you want a faster scanning method, use the "/QUICK" switch.

If you are using a hard disk with multiple drives (C: D: E: etc) you need
to give one command for each drive.

It is of course also possible to check only a single file - example:

                        F-FCHK A:\BIN\NEW_PROG.EXE

F-FCHK will display the names of the files it checks for viruses.  When an
infected file is found the infection will be reported.  The default is
just to list the infection - not to ask if it should be removed, but by
using the "/QUERY" switch, the program will ask:

                          Disinfect ?

when an infected file is found.  If you press 'Y', F-FCHK will attempt to
remove the infection.

Normally you would want to remove any viruses found, unless you want to
obtain a "live" specimen, that is.  If you do not want to press 'Y'
whenever an infected file is found, you can enter a command of the form:

			F-FCHK  C:\  /AUTO

/AUTO indicates automatic disinfection.

If you only want a list of the files scanned and the result of the
scanning, you can use a command of the form:

			F-FCHK C:\ /LIST

/LIST indicates a list of files, but no "Disinfect ?" prompt.

If you want to delete all infected files, use the "/DELETE" switch.
Infected files will then be overwritten several times, with different bit
patterns, and then deleted.

If F-FCHK can remove the virus it will display the message

                            Cured...

If the file is infected with multiple copies of the virus, the message
may appear a number of times.

It is, however, possible that F-FCHK will display the message

                    Virus could not be removed.

The most likely explanation for that is that you have a new variant of
the virus - one that F-FCHK does not know of.  If this happens, and you
are sure you have the latest version of the package, please send me the
file in question, either on a diskette or via E-MAIL.

Some viruses like the 405-virus cannot be removed, since an infection
consists of overwriting the original program.  This will, of course,
destroy it.  In those cases the only solution is to restore the infected
file from a backup (you do keep good backups, or ....  ?)

F-FCHK reports the number of files it checks.  This number may be
incorrect when certain viruses (like Jerusalem) are being infected, as
new files are created while disinfecting and both the new and old files
might be counted.

All files that might be infected will be checked for infection, however.

A virus can be hidden in a program by infecting it, and then running a
program like LZEXE, PKLITE, DIET, ICE or EXEPACK to create a program
which will unpack itself in memory when executed.  A virus scanner will
not be able to find the virus, unless it knows how to unpack the program.
This ability has bot been added yet, but F-FCHK will display a warning
message if it finds a packed file - indicating that the file could not
be scanned for viruses.

When F-FCHK has disinfected a file, it has usually been restored to the
original state before infection.  In many cases the disinfected program will
have 1-15 additional garbage bytes at the end.  Those bytes were added by
the virus, in order to make the length of the program a multiple of 16
bytes, before infection.  As the number of those bytes cannot be detected
by F-FCHK, they cannot be removed.  Normally they will not have any
effect, unless the program checks its currents length.  In those cases it
will report an incorrect length after infection, and will have to be
restored from a backup.

In version 1.16 the file TROJAN.TXT was added.  It contains signatures
for several Trojans and "joke" programs which are often found in large
collections of viruses.  Those programs are not a serious threat in most
cases, and will probably never be encountered by most users.  The only
reason they are included is that those programs are often included when
comparative reviews of anti-virus packages are done, and as some of my
competitors detect them, I am practically forced to do so too.


--------------------------------- F-DISINF.EXE ---------------------------------

F-DISINF will check boot sectors on diskettes and hard disks.  If an
infection is found, you will be asked if you want it removed.

This program recognizes all the boot sector viruses mentioned in BOOTVIR.TXT
It requires the SIGN.TXT file to be present in the current directory or
the same directory as F-DISINF.EXE is located in.  To run the program, give a
command of the form:

                        F-DISINF <drive>
Example:
                        F-DISINF A:

F-DISINF may report that a boot sector is...

                 ...maybe infected with an unknown virus...

This is quite normal in the case of game diskettes, which may contain
just about anything in the boot sector.  However, if you get this message
when examining a "normal" diskette, formatted using the FORMAT command,
there may indeed be a virus on the diskette.

F-DISINF requires that the computer is not currently infected when you
run it, so you should either run F-SYSCHK or install F-DRIVER first.


---------------------------------- F-XLOCK.EXE ---------------------------------

F-XLOCK adds a short module to the end of other programs.  The purpose of
this module is to perform a test, every time the program is run.  If the
program has been infected with a virus, a message will appear:

                "THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN INFECTED!"

and the computer will "freeze".  Should this happen, you must turn the
computer off, reboot from a "clean" diskette and start disinfecting.

You can lock multiple files at the same time, using a command like...

                        F-XLOCK C:\BIN\*.*

This will lock every .COM and .EXE file in the \BIN subdirectory.  Other
files will not be touched.

There are programs that cannot be locked.  .COM files shorter than three
bytes or longer than 64700 bytes or so cannot be locked.  In a few rare
cases it is not possible to lock .EXE files, because the add-on module
would overwrite the space reserved for the stack or because the
information about file length which is stored in the file header does not
agree with the true length of the file.

It is important to remember that adding this module to files will not
prevent infection, but only provide immediate detection.

If you lock every program on your computer in this way, you will catch
most new program viruses that might somehow bypass the other programs in the
package.  This method is not 100% foolproof, however.

F-XLOCK should only be used on computers running DOS 3.0 or higher.  If
you are using an older version of DOS, it is totally ineffective.

--------------------------------- F-UNLOCK.EXE ---------------------------------

It may be necessary to remove the code that F-XLOCK adds to other programs
in certain cases.  A program might perform a similar check on itself and the
code added by F-XLOCK would then look just like a virus infection.  

To remove the code added by F-XLOCK, just give the command:

                        F-UNLOCK <file>

It is possible to remove thus code from multiple files with one command.
Example:
                        F-UNLOCK C:\BIN\*.*


---------------------------------- F-XCHK.EXE ----------------------------------

This program can be used in certain cases to provide almost 100% protection
against all program viruses, even those who have not yet been written.

However, this program can only rarely be used.  F-XCHK is a memory resident
program that will check every program run for infections.  To use it, you
must first check (using F-FCHK) that there are no programs currently
infected.  Then use F-XLOCK to add the self-checking code to every .COM
and .EXE file on the computer.

Now, copy F-XCHK.EXE to the root directory on the drive you boot from and
place the following command in AUTOEXEC.BAT:

                              F-PROT\F-XCHK

(assuming that the program is in the F-PROT subdirectory, as described in
INSTALL.TXT).

F-XCHK will now check every program you try to run, to see if it has been
locked, using F-XLOCK and not corrupted.  If something seems wrong, F-XCHK
will simply cause the attempt to fail.  If the program was indeed infected
with a virus, it will not be able to do any harm, since the virus will
never be activated.

Of course, the F-XCHK program is not the ultimate solution to all virus
problems.  It should only be used on computers with no software
development and where new software is only rarely installed.  


---------------------------------- F-RUN.EXE ----------------------------------

There is one problem with F-XCHK - what if you have to run a program that
cannot be locked by F-XLOCK ?

F-RUN was designed to solve this problem.  You give the command

                F-RUN <name of program you want to run> <parameters>
Example:
                F-RUN C:\PROGRAM.EXE 4 5 6

This should have the same effect as giving the following command on a
computer where F-XCHK is not active:

                C:\PROGRAM 4 5 6

The F-RUN program should only be used to execute programs that cannot be
locked.
                
---------------------------------- F-DLOCK.EXE ---------------------------------

This program will write-protect the hard disk.  Normally it is not at all
useful to do so, but in some cases it might be.  For example you might
want to do so if you are running a program you do not fully trust.  With
F-DLOCK and F-POPUP installed, you will be alerted if the program makes
any attempt to write to the hard disk.  

To run this program, simply give the command:

                                     F-DLOCK

Every hard disk in your computer will then be write-protected until you
remove the F-DLOCK program from memory.  It is possible to bypass this
protection by directly manipulating the hardware, but no virus known
today is that sophisticated.

Do not install F-LOCK and F-DLOCK at the same time.


----------------------------------- F-EX.EXE -----------------------------------

When you need to remove the memory-resident programs in the F-PROT
package, you have to use the F-EX program.  

You cannot remove the memory resident programs if you have run another
program later that also stays resident and hooks the same interrupts.
The F-MMAP program can be used to see what programs are currently
resident.

If multiple programs are installed, they must generally be removed in
reverse order, that is the program most recently added must be removed
first.

To use the F-EX program you give a command of the form:

                        F-EX <name of program>
Example:
                        F-EX F-DLOCK


----------------------------------- F-DIR.EXE ----------------------------------

This program provides a very simple extension to the DIR command.  It will
list all the programs on a specified drive that are marked as "read-only",
"hidden" and/or "system".

Example:
                        F-DIR C:

You can specify that you only want a list of hidden files, by adding /h,
or you can obtain read-only files with /r.  The subcommand /s will list
all files marked as "system".  The commands can be combined, example:

                        F-DIR C: /h /s

This will list all files that are marked as "hidden" or "system".


---------------------------------- F-MMAP.EXE ----------------------------------

F-MMAP displays a memory map, which looks something like this:

  9F00    4096        -------------  6F

Base memory size: 651264 bytes (636K).

Free base memory: 447424 bytes in 3 blocks.

If the computer contains expanded memory, its allocation will also be
shown.

You can use this program to see what programs are currently active in
memory.  It is actually not an anti-virus tool, but intended as a generally
useful utility.

The "Address" column shows the starting segment address of any programs
found in memory.  The size of the program appears next, followed by the
number of blocks it occupies.  The first part of the operating system and
any installed device drivers (like F-DRIVER) do not use ordinary memory
blocks, so a "-" appears in this column.  Programs usually occupy two blocks,
one containing the program itself and the other containing the environment
variables and the name of the program.  The name appears in the next
column, and finally a list is displayed, containing the numbers of the
interrupts (in hex) the program "owns".

When using DOS 2.x the name of the program is not accessible, and a
question mark will appear instead.  This is also the case when an "orphan"
memory block is found - that is a memory block that does not contain a
program and does not seem to belong to any program currently in use.
Such blocks are rare, however.

The line containing 

  9F00    4096        -------------  6F

needs an explanation. It means that there is a small memory block "at the
top" that has been made "invisible" to DOS.  This may possibly indicate
that the computer is infected with a virus, but there may also be other
explanations.


-------------------------- F-HIDE.EXE and F-UNHIDE.EXE -------------------------

Strictly speaking these two programs are not anti-virus programs, but
since they can be quite useful sometimes, I decided to include them in
the package.  

F-HIDE is used to hide a file or directory, so it will not appear when a
DIR command is given.  To use F-HIDE, you give a command like:

                        F-HIDE C:\HIDDEN\*.*

The above example would hide all the files found in the \HIDDEN
subdirectory.

F-UNHIDE is used just like F-HIDE, the only difference is that it will
make hidden files visible again.


---------------------------------- F-BOOT.EXE ----------------------------------

F-BOOT will display the boot sector, both in hex and character form.  This
might be useful occasionally, provided you know how to interpret the
output, which usually looks something like this:

To run the program, you give a command of the form:

                        F-BOOT <drive>
Example:
                        F-BOOT B:


----------------------------------- F-PBR.EXE ----------------------------------

F-PBR displays the partition boot record (PBR) of the first hard disk in
your system.  One virus ("New Zealand") hides in this area.  To run the
program you give the command

                        F-PBR

Then you will see the PBR, which should look something similar to this:

the output.
