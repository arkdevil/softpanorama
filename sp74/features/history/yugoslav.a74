                       Draft Recommendation
                       ====================

          on lessons drawn from the Yugoslav conflict



    The Assembly,

    Noting that all the efforts of the international community
to solve the conflict in former Yugoslavia have failed;

    Noting that the conflict in former Yugoslavia has shown
clearly that in future there will be no possibility for EC
member states to act independently in matters concerning peace
and stability on the European continent;

    Convinced that Europe will have to develop an independent
capability to act in defence of its own specific security
interests, while recognising the continuing vital contribution
of the United States to European defence;

    Considering that the EC, having realised that it had to give
up its original mistaken objective of keeping former Yugoslavia
together in a federative structure, has not yet managed to
identify a clear political strategy towards the Balkans;

    Noting that similarly international organisations such as
NATO, the CSCE, the United Nations and even powerful countries
like the United States have been unable to identify a clear and
effective political strategy towards the Balkans;

    Noting that a peace agreement coming to grips with all
conflicts in the region is the only viable way to deal with the
dissolution of former Yugoslavia;

    Noting that in conflict prevention apart from diplomatic and
economic action, consideration must also be given to the
possibility of preventive military presence through the
deployment of peace-keeping forces;

    Considering that the seemingly hurried restructuring of
armed forces in WEU member states in recent years may have to be
reviewed in the light of Europe's inability to provide forces
for long-term peace-keeping operations in its area of
responsibility;

    Recognising at the same time that political will is
naturally the first requirement for any operation involving
military forces;

    Noting that any peace agreement for the region must include
rigorous provision for arms control, the reduction of armed
forces and adequate enforcement provisions;

    Considering that the EC's regrettable difficulty in
identifying its aims clearly has caused much fatal hesitation
and many changes in its policy towards the conflict in former
Yugoslavia;

    Noting that foreign and security policy are of little avail
if they are not complemented by a defence policy;

    Noting with satisfaction the creation of the Eurocorps and
stressing the need for a European rapid action force;

    Noting that, within Europe, recognition of new states
requires a new approach which includes due appraisal of its
security and the nature of the collective commitment to its
integrity;

    Noting that recognition of a new state cannot be an end in
itself and that the new state's ability to meet the criteria for
recognition and the responsibilities resulting from this
recognition must consequently be examined in depth;

    Noting that the problems created by large movements of
refugees clearly show that it is in the interests of European
countries to have an agreed reception policy and, more
important, to find a means of averting the conflicts which cause
such movements,



    RECOMMENDS THAT THE COUNCIL

1.    Consider the establishment of a European rapid action
force to which the member countries of WEU should make
commitments including greater integration of training and
equipment;

2.    Implement the chapter of the Maastricht Treaty concerned
with the joint foreign and security policy of the European Union
as soon as possible, determine the role of WEU and set out terms
for better integration of the foreign and defence policies of
Europe;

3.    Further develop the military contingency planning
capability of the WEU Planning Cell, while at the same time
including the widening of its intelligence access and powers of
initiation;

4.    Clearly identify threats to Europe's security and suggest
preventive action at diplomatic, economic and military levels in
part to provide practical assistance to the transition process
in new democracies in order to avoid a reversion to past
policies;

5.    Emphasise to Greece the interest of its recognition of the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in the period prior to its
accession to WEU;

6.    Re-examine the respective tasks and roles of the United
States and its European allies in the maintenance of peace and
security on the European continent and take the appropriate
measures to ensure that under no circumstances will it be
possible for a security vacuum to develop for lack of
appropriate preparation, co-operation and co-ordination;

7.    Provide the UNPROFOR command with the ways and means it is
seeking to ensure compliance with all the resolutions of the
United Nations Security Council;

8.    Suggest to the appropriate authorities that they should
intensify low-level flights over Bosnia, particularly Sarajevo,
as an effective deterrent to the repeated shelling of the
civilian population, which results in daily slaughter.

                       Explanatory Memorandum
                       ======================

          (submitted by Sir Russell Johnston, Rapporteur)




I. Introduction
   ------------


  The savage war in former Yugoslavia has profoundly shaken many
convictions about peace and security in post-cold war Europe.  A
conflict in the centre of Europe with hundreds of thousands
killed, both military and civilians, and even larger numbers
tortured, persecuted and expelled from their houses and lands,
an important part of the existing habitat and economic
infrastructure devasted and the majority of the region's
cultural heritage deliberately destroyed seemed unthinkable. Yet
it happened.  None of the serious efforts made by the CSCE, the
European Community, or the United Nations, has been effective
enough to prevent the bloodshed and devastation which, after
more than two years of fighting, have become commonplace in the
daily news reports.

  Could a war and all its consequences have been prevented?  Has
the international community, and in particular the European
Community, failed to take the appropriate action?  Many
questions have been asked and just as many proposals have been
made by politicians and political commentators.

  If in the present report the crisis in former Yugoslavia is
again subject to discussion, the main objective is not to point
out who was at fault.  Indeed, fatal mistakes and misjudgments
have been made and many of those who are, or were, involved in
mediation efforts or negotiations are the first to recognise
this.

  Why did Europe make it clear that it would abstain from the
use of force?  Was there a fundamental reason to stick to the
principle of respecting existing borders, even if these had been
internal borders within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?  Why
were sanctions and other decisions meant to curb aggression or
violence not enforced at an earlier stage?

  One purpose of this report is to do some soul-searching which
might help to establish a framework for policies and procedures
which might prevent future similar crises.  It may also help to
further dispel some of the illusions about a new world order and
the altruistic co-operation of all civilised nations in
maintaining such an order.



II.  Action taken by the EC
     ----------------------


  One feature of the war in former Yugoslavia is widespread
violence and atrocity.  Mass media have diffused images of
unparalled savagery into the living-rooms of hundreds of
millions of Western Europeans, many of whom had spent their
holidays on the beaches of the very country where all this is
happening.

  No wonder, therefore, that in both public and parliamentary
debates in all Western European countries there was an almost
general appeal for governments to "do something" in order to
stop the killing.

  In fact the governments did something, in particular through
the EC.  Cease-fire agreements were brokered, EC observers were
sent to the area of conflict, a peace conference was
established, the conflicting parties were almost dragged to the
negotiation table, and economic and arms embargoes were imposed.
At a later stage, the United Nations was called upon, which not
only resulted in an endless number of United Nations Security
Council resolutions but also in the peace-keeping forces being
sent to Croatia, humanitarian aid being facilitated in Bosnia-
Herzegovina, the presence of a monitoring force in Macedonia and
the enforcement of sanctions imposed.

  It should also be noted that the EC managed to hammer out a
common European policy which may have been the best one possible
at that moment.  However, it clearly had the flaws of a
consensus policy and make-shift solutions which had been
prepared not long before and after thorough examination of all
the issues involved.  This policy has not solved the conflict
nor has it prevented the killing, but until now it has contained
the conflict within the borders of former Yugoslavia. The
different parties apparently had such a remarkable stamina in
mutual butchery that none of the classic peaceful means
enumerated in Chapters VI and VII of the United Nations Charter
has been enough to stop the conflict. Can one reproach the EC -
which was mentally not prepared to face the display of violence
and savagery which came to the surface at an early stage - of
not having made provision for rapid military action, which then
might still have nipped the conflict in the bud, leaving room
for negotiations between different parties on an equal footing?
The specific issue of the use of force or the credible threat to
do so will be discussed later in the present report.

  What were the most obvious shortcomings in the EC's efforts to
draft and implement a common policy?

  The EC could have prepared itself better for a possible
conflict in Yugoslavia.  Nobody can reasonably argue that in the
EC's member states there was a lack of information about
political developments in Yugoslavia.

  During the cold war, Yugoslavia was generally considered to be
the most open of all European communist states.  The end of the
cold war did not suddenly cut off this steady flow of
information, but rather increased the possibilities of assessing
the situation.  Neighbouring countries, including in particular
Hungary which was increasingly worried about the position of the
Hungarian minority in the Republic of Serbia, actively informed
EC member states about what could happen in Yugoslavia.

  It seems, however, that many have turned a blind eye to some
of the developments after Tito's death and their possible
consequences and especially the rise of nationalism, in which
many leading Serb intellectuals and former dissidents have
played an important role.  Among them are well-known people like
Mihajlo Markovic, Dobrica Cosic, Matija Beckovic and Vojislav
Seselj, to name just a few.  As early as 1987, the Serbian
Academy of Arts and Sciences prepared a memorandum, outlining a
"national programme" which made a paranoid case for Serbian
nationalism based on historic "injustices" done to Serbs,
especially to those living in Kosovo.

  It is only logical that their nationalist thinking finally
gave birth to official party policy as contained in a document
which was made public by the Serbian socialist party on 15th
July 1991 stating that: "the regions in Croatia with a Serbian
majority must establish an autonomous region of Yugoslavia", and
that "arguments are no longer sufficient to defend the interests
of the Serbian people ... Serbia needs a real military force,
highly motivated".  Concerning the Albanians, it was said that
"according to international criteria, separatist aspirations of
ethnic minorities cannot be tolerated".

  Since Milosevic came to power in Serbia in 1987, Serbia's
government has conducted a consistent nationalist policy
including the violation of the autonomous status of both Kosovo
and Vojvodina and political repression of minorities.

  Apparently there has been a lack of anticipation and forward
planning, if not in national foreign ministries, then certainly
in the European political co-operation framework.

  Until the middle of 1991, when both Slovenia's and Croatia's
secession were accomplished facts, the EC had been supporting
federal Prime Minister, Ante Markovic's policy of national
conciliation and economic recovery.

  It has been argued that all the energy of Europe's diplomatic
chancelleries was concentrated on the approaching collapse of
the Soviet Union and on the Gulf war and its aftermath.  This is
a point in case, but still it is astonishing that so little
attention was paid to the indications which foreboded the first
major armed conflict on European territory since the second
world war.

  If, understandably, the EC has the ambition to play a role as
the most influential and powerful moderator on the European
political scene, it will have to create the conditions to enable
it to do so.  A prerequisite is more intensive co-operation in
exchanging intelligence between all members.

  At the same time, the EC must analyse and define its strategic
interests.  Only then will it be able to establish the
principles and guidelines which should be the basis of a
consistent foreign and security policy, with member states
committed to its implementation with all necessary means at
their disposal.  Another apparent handicap in the EC's nascent
foreign and security policy procedures is the collective
decision-making machinery in the European Council, where
consensus is considered vital for a common strategy.  It appears
to be difficult to decide on a common security policy if there
is no authority within the EC or elsewhere, which leads the way.
Especially in security matters, most, if not all, EC countries
were used to waiting for the United States to tell them what to
do.  The crisis in Yugoslavia introduced an ambiguous situation
in that on the one hand the EC was eager to demonstrate its
ability to handle a security crisis in Europe, while on the
other hand it was looking over its shoulder to see what the
United States would say or do, more or less subconsciously
expecting that Big Brother would rush in if things really turned
nasty.  The EC quickly learned, however, that the United States
is no longer prepared to exert its leadership if it believes
there is no threat to its own national interests.

  Should this lead to the conclusion that the EC needs a new
leader, a primus inter pares, who tells the other members what
to do if Europe's security is threatened?  Not necessarily, but
if the EC wishes to be able to react rapidly and adequately
under such circumstances, it may have to consider procedures
where member states wishing to act should be allowed to do so
under the aegis of the EC, if there is sufficient support among
the member states.  This would mean that foreign and security
policy decisions could not be blocked by one single or perhaps
two member states.  On the other hand, it should be clear that
no member state could be forced to participate in EC foreign
policy action or to provide military forces for such action
without first reaching agreement on the matters concerned.

  While it is possible to imagine such opt-out procedures during
the early stages of building a European foreign and security
policy,  there can be no question of them in situations covered
by the modified Brussels Treaty with the compulsory obligation
of Article V.

  The crisis in former Yugoslavia has made it clear that
situations in which a single member state of the EC or WEU is
prepared to act in order to solve a conflict in Europe outside
the territory of the EC must be excluded.  EC and WEU member
states are far too interdependent to claim that they can or will
act without the others.

  Much has been said about the lack of forces and the
possibility of co-ordinating military operations.  These
problems of a practical nature can be solved provided there is a
political will, the first requirement for any operation
involving the use of military force with all the inherent risks.

  It should be noted in this framework that in NATO, there is a
growing consensus over the need for a close link between NATO
and the European defence identity, in particular WEU.  The ideas
put forward include the suggestion discussed by NATO's defence
ministers at their recent meeting at Travemuende on 21st October
1993 that, in the event of a specifically European operation by
WEU, NATO should place its technical and logistical assets at
WEU's disposal.

  The major lesson of the conflict in former Ygoslavia is that
the EC has reached a point of no return in the development of a
common foreign and security policy.  Member states are aware
that they have a common responsibility for peace and stability
in Europe.  They will have to act accordingly.


III.  The EC's policy in the conflict in former Yugoslavia
and the position of Germany and Greece

  With the actual decision-making process in the EC, any
European foreign and security policy has to take into account
the attitudes and opinions of each member state.  It is well
known that this does not always facilitate the establishment of
a very energetic policy.  In particular Germany and Greece
(surprised to find themselves together!) are often accused of
having stood in the way of a reasonable and balanced EC policy
in former Yugoslavia.  Are these accusations justified?  It
would seem useful to have a closer look at the attitude of each
country.

  First Germany.  As is known, the EC has been reluctant to
recognise the Republics of Slovenia and Croatia too soon and
many have pointed a finger at Germany for forcing the EC into
early recognition.  Today, however, there are few experts who
would assert that Germany's attitude on this issue caused war in
former Yugoslavia.  There were several arguments in favour of
early recognition.  First of all, it should be observed that the
EC's hesitation to recognise the newly-independent republics had
an increasingly adverse effect on efforts to restore peace,
since it only reinforced the Serb leadership's expectation that
the international community would accept a Greater Serbia policy
of force under the guise of preserving the Yugoslavian state as
a community of nations and peoples.  Indeed, in the autumn of
1991, with war raging in Croatia, it became clear to most EC
members that Serbia was using the peace negotiations as a shield
to continue the war and that recognition of the new republics
could be a means of legitimately halting aggression.

  Opponents of the early recognition of Slovenia and Croatia
argued that it would deprive Lord Carrington of the leverage to
find an overall political solution.  In fact, Lord Carrington
had no leverage at all since the international community
repeatedly affirmed that it would not consider military
intervention in order to contain Serbian aggression against
Croatia.  As a consequence, Lord Carrington had no means of
bringing pressure to bear on the non-Serbian parties to reach an
agreement with Serbia on granting regional autonomy to Serbs in
Croatia.  It was the German Government that persuaded Croatia to
change its constitution in this respect.  It should be noted
therefore that Germany has positively tried to help promote the
best possible solution through active diplomacy.

  Germany has also been accused of letting other EC member
states send land forces to former Yugoslavia for peace-keeping
and humanitarian aid, tasks which Germany itself could not
perform for different reasons.  Here too, Western Europeans
should show some indulgence.

  Recent history was a first valid reason for not sending German
land forces as peace-keepers in a conflict between Serbs and
Croats.  It is also very hard to object to other constitutional
impediments to the involvement of German armed forces in
military operations in former Yugoslavia.  Indeed, it should not
be forgotten that after the second world war the allied
countries took pains to re-educate and transform the population
of Germany to become a peace-loving, if not pacifist, people.
The same countries should not be surprised at the success of
their efforts.  Of course, there may be good reason to adapt
Germany's attitude to the entirely different situation in the
world today, but this can be safely left to the Germans to
decide, knowing that they are concerned with the position of
their country in Europe and its image in the world.

  The position of Greece has been and still is a more
complicated factor in the formulation of a European policy
towards former Yugoslavia and its now independent republics.

  First, Greece has from the beginning taken a negative view
regarding recognition of the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia.  Greece has used its veto to block the EC's
recognition of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an
independent state, notwithstanding the fact that in January 1992
a committee of legal experts under the chairmanship of
Mr. Badinter concluded that Macedonia met all the conditions for
recognition by the EC.
  The reasons for Greece's attitude are almost too well-known to
be repeated here, but in essence, Greece has expressed fears
that a new independent Republic of Macedonia may become a threat
to peace in that region, alleging that in its constitution of
17th November 1991 there are references to the possibility of
changing existing borders and intervening in the internal
affairs of neighbouring states on the pretext of issues
concerning the status and the rights of alleged minorities.

  Moreover, Greece asserts that it has a monopoly on the name of
Macedonia which, it argues, "has been Greek for 3 000 years".
Neither had Macedonia the right to adopt the Star of Vergina as
its coat of arms because it is a Greek symbol which was found on
Philip of Macedon's tomb near Salomila.

  In April 1993, the United Nations Security Council adopted a
resolution which cleared the way for the admission of Macedonia,
to be referred to provisionally as the "former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia", to the United Nations.  The questions of both the
name and the flag of the new state were left to be settled under
the auspices of the international mediators in the Balkans, then
Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen.

  Second, Greece has never been able entirely to dispel charges
of connivance in violations of the embargo on Serbia and
Montenegro.

  After the last June 1993 session of the Assembly of WEU, the
Greek Ambassador to France, H. E. Mr. Dimitris Macris, wrote to
the President of the Assembly to inform him of Greece's position
regarding the United Nations Security Council sanctions on
Serbia and Montenegro (see Appendix I).  Since then, however,
new charges have been made, as mentioned in Chapter V on
sanctions.

  The return to power of Pasok, under the leadership of Andreas
Papandreou, after the last parliamentary elections in Greece may
have serious implications for the situation in the Balkans.

  In April 1993, Andreas Papandreou, then still the Pasok
opposition leader, publicly declared that the embargo was an
injustice done to one party in the conflict in former
Yugoslavia, saying "Greece must not betray Serbia, its long-time
friend." (3)

  He was elected on a nationalist programme promising resistance
to the "Turkish threat", envisaging Greece allied with Serbia
against Turkey.  He also assured his compatriots of an "even
tougher" policy towards the FYROM.

  On 15th October, Prime Minister Papandreou announced that
Greece would pull out of the United Nations-sponsored
negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia over
its name.

  With Greece due to assume the rotating EC presidency on 1st
January 1994, this does not augur very well for a European
Balkan policy.
  What must be done?  An important part of the agitation and
rhetoric of Greek politicians over Macedonia serves their
personal and domestic political objectives.  Strong nationalist
attitudes still pay off well in Greek politics.  But the
rhetoric may not always be well understood abroad and it may
even worry other member states of the EC if it is accompanied by
action running counter to European interests.

  Greece has its own specific and justified security interests
in the region to which the other EC member states should pay due
attention.  However, a reasonable examination and debate of
these interests may be hindered if Greece continues to confuse
priorities in its domestic and foreign policy.

  It must know that being a member of a security alliance
includes both rights and obligations.  For more than forty
years, NATO has been able to shelter Greece from the possible
threat of the Warsaw Pact.  There is no reason to even think
that it would not be prepared to protect Greece against new
post-cold war threats.

  As is known, a protocol of accession to WEU was signed with
Greece on 20th November 1992.  There is no doubt that Greek
accession to WEU fits into the logic of decisions taken in
Maastricht in 1991 as regards the development of a European
common foreign and security policy and of a genuine European
security and defence identity.

  Article V of the modified Brussels Treaty obliges member
states to afford "all the military and other aid and assistance
in their power ... if any of the high contracting parties should
be the object of an armed attack in Europe".  As said earlier in
a report on the enlargement of WEU (4), Greek membership should
enhance the mutual coherence and security which is the objective
of the WEU alliance and not be a source of additional risks.
The accession protocol with Greece should therefore not be
ratified before Greece has satisfactorily solved its existing
dispute with FYROM.



IV.  The United States' attitude
     ---------------------------


  It is no doubt a significant feature of the conflict in former
Yugoslavia that the United States did not participate in any
diplomatic effort to find a solution to the conflict during the
early phase lasting up to April 1992, when war broke out in
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  For the first time since the second world war, the United
States did not take the lead in handling a European security
crisis.  Why did that happen and should it be interpreted as a
changing of the guard, with the EC taking over from the United
States?

  Before rushing into easy conclusions, certain specific
developments should be taken into consideration.

  Two connected reasons for United States reluctance to act were
that it was thought that even though a break-up of Yugoslavia
could have repercussions on political stability in Central and
Eastern Europe, no American interest was directly at stake.

  On the other hand, according to the Americans, the European
Community was apparently best placed to conduct negotiations
preventing a dissolution of the Yugoslavian federation.

  It should also be noted that United States diplomacy was fully
involved in the Gulf crisis and its aftermath, in the Middle
East peace conference and in arms reduction negotiations with an
increasingly unstable Soviet Union, each of these matters being
considered issues of far greater importance.

  The 1992 presidential election campaign was approaching
rapidly and it was clear that according to an overwhelming
majority of the United States electorate, the Bush
administration had paid far too much attention to foreign policy
and too little attention to internal matters and the ever-
increasing budget deficit.  Involvement in any foreign policy
adventure without a guaranteed chance of success was therefore
excluded.

  Moreover, while the political leadership saw little chance for
successful mediation, the military were by no means eager to
send troops into what is generally considered to be the
notoriously hazardous Yugoslav environment.  Lastly, the United
States administration was aware of the EC's desire to
demonstrate its ability in solving a European security problem.
Although at times a persistent nostalgia for world leadership
can be discerned, the United States administration supports the
idea of greater integration for Europe, which could be a
reliable partner in building and maintaining peace and in
defending common interests.

  As for the United States administration's political opinion on
what should be done, there was no doubt that it agreed with the
United Kingdom and France that Yugoslavia's territorial
integrity should be maintained insofar as possible.  The
disintegration of Yugoslavia was considered to be a dangerous
precedent for the whole region, where many other nationalist
conflicts or crises were surfacing.

  However, when a break-up of Yugoslavia appeared inevitable in
the autumn of 1991, with heavy fighting quickly spreading over
parts of Croatia, the United States agreed to the imposition of
sanctions.  Yet, throughout 1992, when the whole political scene
was absorbed by the presidential election campaign, it avoided
any direct involvement.

  Only after President Clinton's inauguration did the United
States offer to become "actively and directly engaged" in peace
efforts in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  It made a series of proposals
and nominated Reginald Bartholomew as a special envoy to the
international peace talks on former Yugoslavia.

  As already known, the results of this direct engagement have
not led to a significant breakthrough in the peace process.

  Notwithstanding much criticism of the EC's inability to solve
the conflict in former Yugoslavia, the United States has agreed
to the Western European approach that a peace plan cannot be
implemented before it has been accepted by all parties.

  In September 1993, President Clinton, the United States
Secretary of State, the national security advisor and the United
States permanent representative to the United Nations explained
their view of United States foreign policy.  The President's
message was that the United States would use its unique position
"to expand and strengthen the world's community of market-based
democracies".  He also said that "the United States plans to
remain engaged and to lead".

  Altogether, however, the view presented was not very clear and
left many doubts about the scope of United States determination
to get involved in crises.  A new definition of  United States
national interests in the post cold war era has not yet been
established and recent events in Somalia and Haiti seem to
confirm the suggestion of a political commentator (5) that a new
kind of containment policy is being developed, in which the
United States only intervenes in crises that are containable,
manageable, cheap and close-ended, except in the event of mortal
threats to American security.

  After the Washington agreement on the joint action plan for
containing the war in Bosnia, the United States Secretary of
State said that "Beyond the Congress and outside the
(Washington) Beltway" he felt "real support from the American
people" for the government's policy.  He was aware that some
critics said that the United States had not lived up to its
responsibility, but went on to say that:

"In this kind of situation, a humanitarian crisis a long way
from home, in the middle of another continent, I think that our
actions here are proportionate to what our responsibilites are.

We can't do it all.  We have to measure our ability to act in
the interests of the United States, but to save our power for
those situations which threaten our deepest national interest,
at the same time doing all we can where there's humanitarian
concern." (6)

  These guidelines were confirmed in the Secretary of State
address on 20th September 1993, meant to clarify the new
administration's approach to world affairs, when he stated:

"The central purpose of our foreign policy is to ensure the
security of our nation and to ensure its economic prosperity as
well, and to promote democratic values.  The United States must
maintain its military strength and reinvigorate its economy so
we can retain the option to act alone when that is best for us."

Later he added that:

"We should not ignore the value of working with other nations."
(7)

  The message given here is clear.  Europe should shoulder its
own responsibilities and be prepared to take care of its own
security interests if they do not coincide with those of the
United States.

  There is a strong feeling that the United States leadership is
interested mainly in maintaining good relations and a strategic
partnership with Russia, while leaving it to Europe to solve
problems in Central and Eastern Europe.  This minimalist
approach would seem to be neither in the interest of Western
Europe nor that of the United States. What is needed is co-
ordination, if not close co-operation, between the United States
and Western Europe in helping Central and Eastern European
countries, including Russia and Ukraine, to develop their
economies and democratic institutions as the best guarantee
against conflicts and insecurity.

  In his recent address to the United Nations General Assembly,
President Clinton enumerated four important conditions for
United Nations peace-keeping operations, stating that the United
Nations should assess peace-keeping proposals carefully to
determine if there is a genuine threat to international peace,
what the objectives would be, at what point the peace-keepers
would be removed and what the cost would be.

  Earlier, the United States permanent representative to the
United Nations had stated that the United States would insist on
answers to fundamental questions before undertaking new
obligations in a United Nations peace-keeping operation.  Among
these questions would be the following:

-  Does the proposed peace-keeping mission have clear objectives
and can its scope be clearly defined?

-  Is a cease-fire in place and have the parties agreed to a
United Nations presence?

-  Are the financial and human resources available to accomplish
the mission?

-  Can an "end point" to United Nations participation be
identified? (8)

  After clashes between United States peace-keeping soldiers and
followers of the Somali warlord, General Mohammed Farrah Aidid,
causing the death of 12 United States soldiers, President
Clinton stated that he wanted to bring home all American forces
before 31st March 1994.  The President made it clear that it was
not the United States' job to rebuild Somalia's society or even
to create a political process that would allow Somalia's clans
to live and work in peace". (9)

  In Haiti on 11th October, a crowd of several hundred armed
demonstrators managed to prevent the disembarkment of a small
contingent of United States soldiers who had come to Port-au-
Prince to join a United Nations assistance mission sent to help
in the re-establishment of democracy on the island.

  Events in Somalia and also in Haiti have made it clear that
even the United States is going to be ever more reluctant to
commit troops for peace-making, or even peace-keeping, in
regional and local conflicts when there are no guarantees of
success and when there is not a direct and more or less self-
evident threat to vital national interests.

  The Clinton administration has until now favoured a
multilateral approach to world affairs.  This means that
American power is being placed at the service of the world
community on the grounds that the United Nations will use it
only for purposes approved by broad international consensus and
in conformity with international law.  This attitude can only be
welcomed.

  At the same time, however, there is still some ambiguity in
the implementation of this policy.  While the United States is
willing to work in the framework of the United Nations and other
multilateral organisations, it does so only on the assumption
that it can play the leading role, both politically and
militarily, and thus it wishes to have the command of any
military operation in which its troops are involved.  This means
that it always asks its partners to occupy a position which it
would not be prepared to occupy itself.  Another ambiguity which
has only recently become more evident is that it still has the
natural and instinctive habit of a superpower, inclined to
tackle problems with a show of military force, while it backs
off as soon as it encounters serious resistance, for fear of
criticism at home in case of casualties.

  This can lead to a paradoxical situation where United States
soldiers are not sent on a mission to create a secure
environment for the population in a conflict, but rather to have
a secure situation created for themselves.

  On the other hand, it should be admitted that, for
understandable reasons, the United States has not yet defined
accurately the full range of its national interests in the post-
cold war world, which makes it difficult always to take the
right decision about where and when to intervene and also to
foresee the consequences of such intervention.

  In these circumstances, what should be Europe's attitude?  As
regards the reappraisal of the United States foreign policy it
must be patient, maybe even indulgent.  Europe is not in a
position to dictate to the United States what its vital national
interests should be, nor is anybody else in the world.

  On the other hand, Europe cannot wait to identify its own
vital and strategic interests until the United States has made
up its mind.   It must act now and prepare for a future where,
on the European continent, it will most probably have to defend
on its own certain vital and strategic interests which it may no
longer share with the United States and which it therefore will
have to handle under the benevolent eye, but without the active
participation of, the United States.



V.  Minority rights in Europe and the recognition of new states
    -----------------------------------------------------------


  Although it is generally admitted that minority rights are
presumably the most explosive issue in post-cold war Europe, it
is extremely difficult to find an adequate general solution
acceptable to all the parties concerned.  The conflict in former
Yugoslavia has clearly revealed what can happen if minorities
and majorities do not know where to draw the line.  It has also
shown that the EC had no ready response to the question of what
to do when an ethnic, religious or other minority does not
accept living in a state ruled by a different majority but
claims the right to self-determination, including the adjustment
of existing frontiers - goals that it is prepared to seek by the
use of force.

  It appears that since the beginning of the conflict, Western
Europe has desperately tried to respect the principles of the
Helsinki Final Act, as later specified and confirmed in the 1990
Charter of Paris in order to prevent the collapse of a system of
values and lofty principles.  This system not only confirmed the
status quo in Europe as it emerged from the cold war, it should
also, in the opinion of the EC, guarantee peace and security in
Europe for the future.

  In the following paragraphs, a succinct review will first be
given of Western European activities in the issues of minorities
and the recognition of new states.  The review will be followed
by concluding remarks with an indication of the possible road to
take.


(a)  Guidelines for the recognition of new states in Eastern
     Europe and the Soviet Union


  When the EC member states gradually came to the conclusion
that they had to accept the collapse of former Yugoslavia, they
developed, not without difficulty, a common position concerning
recognition of the republics of former Yugoslavia.  The EC's
foreign ministers, meeting in Brussels on 16th December 1991,
agreed on a compromise consisting of the following elements:

-  on 23rd December 1991, Yugoslav republics wishing to be
recognised should make this known to the EC foreign ministers,
indicating their willingness to meet the conditions set out in
the EC's "Guidelines for the recognition of new states in
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union";

-  following their requests, the Badinter Arbitration Committee
should verify if these states indeed meet the conditions
enumerated in the above guidelines;

-  based on the Badinter Arbitration Committee's advice, the
Twelve would take a decision on recognition on 15th January
1992.

  In the "Guidelines for the recognition of new states in
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union", the Twelve mentioned the
following conditions for recognition:

"-  respect for the provisions of the Charter of the United
Nations and the commitments subscribed to in the Final Act of
Helsinki and in the Charter of Paris, especially with regard to
the rule of law, democracy and human rights;
-  guarantees for the rights of ethnic and national groups and
minorities in accordance with the commitments subscribed to in
the framework of the CSCE;

-  respect for the inviolability of all frontiers which can only
be changed by peaceful means and by common agreement;

-  acceptance of all relevant commitments with regard to
disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation as well as to security
and regional stability;

-  commitment to settle by agreement, including, where
appropriate, by recourse to arbitration, all questions
concerning state succession and regional disputes."


  Among other things, they also declared:

"The European Community and its member states will not recognise
entities which are the result of aggression.  They would take
account of the effects of recognition on neighbouring states."


(b)  The Badinter Arbitration Committee

  When, on 27th August 1991, the Community and its member states
in an extraordinary meeting of the foreign ministers convened a
peace conference on Yugoslavia, it also created an Arbitration
Committee, chaired by Mr. Robert Badinter.  This arbitration
committee produced a number of opinions, at the request both of
Lord Carrington, President of the Peace Conference and of the EC
Council of Ministers, to which reference was made under A. in
this chapter.

  It also produced two opinions at the request of the Serbian
Republic, which used the conference as an intermediary.  These
Serbian requests concerned the right of the Serbian population
in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina to self-determination and the
delimitation of internal borders.

  The right of peoples to self-determination is vaguely defined
in Article 1 of the United Nations Charter.  Indeed, the Charter
did not provide a definition of the word "peoples", nor did it
lay down rules as to how this right is to be exercised.

  The Arbitration Committee appeared to link the rights of
minorities to the rights of peoples.  As a consequence, the
notion of "people" is no longer homogeneous and should not be
seen as encompassing the whole population of any state.  Within
one state, various ethnic, religious or linguistic communities
may exist.  According to the committee's opinion number 2, each
of these communities would have the right to see its identity
recognised and to benefit "from all the human rights and
fundamental freedoms recognised in international law, including,
where appropriate, the right to choose their national identity".

  The Committee also noted that Article 1 of the two 1966
International Convenants on Human Rights establishes that "the
principle of the right to self-determination serves to safeguard
human rights", signifying that "by virtue of this right, each
human entity might indicate his or her belonging to the
community (...) of his or her choice."

  The Committee then suggested that the states concerned might
accord to Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, if they so
desired, the nationality of their choice.  These persons,
declaring themselves Serbs, could retain certain civil and
political rights in the territories of Bosnia-Herzegovina and
Croatia, without thereby questioning the sovereignty of the
state.  Rights of minorities can therefore be respected without
this having to result in a break-up of an existing state.  This
could lead to a distinction between "nationality" and
"citizenship" similar to what is set out in the Treaty on
European Union.

  Furthermore, the Arbitration Committee attached great
importance to the principle of respect for frontiers existing at
the moment of independence and recalled in its opinion number 2
that, whatever the circumstances, "the right to self-
determination must not involve changes to existing frontiers".
On the other hand, according to the committee, states may modify
their frontiers by mutual agreement.

  This conclusion of the committee does not leave much room for
a flexible policy.  What should be done if a minority refuses to
remain in the state of its citizenship if this state, while
according it full minority rights, refuses to change its
frontiers by mutual agreement?  Can such a minority be denied
its right to self-determination if it wishes to be part of a
neighbouring state?  Can this minority be condemned to remain in
the state of its citizenship because of the principle of
inviolability of frontiers?  Would mass migration be the only
solution if no mutual agreement to change frontiers can be
reached between the two neighbouring states?


(c)  The Balladur plan


  Conscious of the acuteness of the problem of minorities in
Europe and of the difficulties of the international community,
including the EC, to implement the principles to which it had
committed itself, the French Government, at the European Council
meeting in Copenhagen on 22nd June 1993, presented a pact on
stability in Europe, also called the Balladur plan.

  France argues that this would offer the Central and Eastern
European countries wishing to move closer to the EC a framework
in which they could, between themselves and on a pragmatic
basis, settle those problems which are considered to be
potential sources of instability.  The ultimate goal would be
the signing of a pact embracing all the bilateral agreements
thereby concluded.

  It is proposed that the preparatory conference for the pact
will do more than solemnly confirm the inviolability of borders
in Europe.  It should also prepare the signing of agreements of
good neighbourliness which are based in particular on the
respect of minority rights in cases where violation of those
rights could lead to international entanglements.

  As regards the rights of minorities, the proposal argues that
existing texts on this subject have gradually developed from
individual rights of people belonging to minorities towards
recognition of their collective character and their close links
with security problems.

  The CSCE High Commissioner should be asked to prepare a report
on the collective rights of minorities.  Following this, the
preparatory conference for the pact should ask the countries of
Central and Eastern Europe to conclude mutual agreements which,
on a case-by-case basis, contain solutions for their minority
problems.

  Preventive procedures should be established in order to avoid
violation of minority rights resulting in security problems.
The role and power of the CSCE High Commissioner should be re-
evaluated and he might be given a more active role as a
mediator.

  The preparatory conference should also examine possible
accompanying measures to promote stability.  It could, in
particular:

-  examine the possibility the WEU to admit as associate
members, signatory states of a European pact whose accession to
the European Union is envisaged and  developing military co-
operation with them, in particular in the field of peace-
keeping;

-  promote military co-operation between Central and Eastern
Europe, the twelve, NATO and WEU;

-  propose concrete measures to reinforce CSCE institutions.

  Apart from countries from Northern, Central and Eastern
Europe, the list of participating countries should also include
the United States, Canada, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova and
the Baltic states.

  At the European summit meeting in Copenhagen, it was decided
to integrate the Balladur proposal, now called the European
stability pact, into joint action in common foreign and security
policy.  On 4th October 1993, a high-level working group
presented an interim report to the EC foreign ministers in which
problems relating to the application of the basic principles of
the pact, in particular, respect of existing borders and of
minority rights, were examined.  The interim report also
contained the first results of an information procedure in the
countries interested in the pact.  Ministers then decided to
adopt a timeframe for action, in particular as regards informal
consultations with the countries interested, priority being
given to those countries which are candidates for the European
Union via the European agreements.

  The full text of the modified proposals for a European
stability pact was not yet available at the time of drafting
this report, but it has been established that no violation will
be allowed of the principle of respect for existing borders.
The pact will furthermore have a political rather than a legal
character, although the underlying bilateral agreements should
have a legal character.  Security guarantees will not be
included in the pact and no sanctions are envisaged. In general,
the pact should be another element of a European framework of
preventive diplomacy.

  At the special summit meeting in Brussels on 29th October, it
was decided that within the framework of the gradual development
of a common foreign and security policy, one of the priorities
for common action should be to promote stability, reinforce the
democratic process and develop regional co-operation in Central
and Eastern Europe.  Furthermore, it was stated that a stability
pact, intended to solve the problem of minorities and to
reinforce the inviolability of frontiers, would be an essential
part of this common action.

  A summit meeting organised by the Council of Europe in Vienna
on 8th October has, however, again shown how difficult it is for
European states to speak with one voice when rights of national
minorities are concerned.  In their final communique, the heads
of state and government, "aware that the protection of national
minorities is an essential element of stability and democratic
security" in Europe, invite European states to establish
conditions allowing the people concerned "to develop their
culture, while preserving their religion, traditions and
customs".  On the other hand, there was no agreement to
establish a definition of the notion of "national minorities",
in particular because of French and British resistance. No
mention was made of collective rights of minorities, an
essential issue for many citizens in Central and Eastern Europe,
but at the same time an issue on which the opinions of various
governments in Western Europe still largely diverge.  Because of
these differences of view, the summit meeting called for the
drafting of a protocol to complete the Council of Europe's
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms.  This task, however, is limited to the cultural field,
in that it is envisaged to protect "individual rights" (which
corresponds to the French and British views)  "particularly for
persons belonging to national minorities" (which corresponds to
German, Austrian and Hungarian concerns).  Furthermore, the
Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers asked to draft a
framework convention defining principles which member states
should respect to guarantee the protection of "national
minorities".  This convention should not be compulsory, nor
should it allow for the development of jurisprudence.


(d)  Conclusion


  Understandably, the conflict in former Yugoslavia has produced
haunting fears of further similar conflicts in Central and
Eastern Europe.  It must therefore be a top priority of the EC's
nascent common foreign and security policy to develop a distinct
and unambiguous position as regards the issues of self-
determination, minority rights and the inviolability or not of
borders.  In doing so, it should be realised that the unimpaired
application of each of these principles may be incompatible.

  Furthermore, it may be too idealistic to assume that
minorities and nations which, under communist rule, have
suffered political suppression and cultural oppression will be
prepared to accept the EC's reasoning regarding European
citizenship and the relative unimportance of national borders in
a unifying Europe.  Western European states indeed have taken
many years to settle their borders and start the process of
unification moving under far more favourable conditions of
government.

  Since the beginning of the conflict in former Yugoslavia, the
EC has been obliged to do some intensive back-pedalling on the
application of principles which it had enunciated in the
beginning, partly or perhaps even mainly because it lacked the
political will to enforce application of these principles with
military means.  There is justified doubt over the question
whether it will be prepared to do so in the future.
  It would, therefore, make sense to take a more flexible stance
towards the application of such principles.  The establishment
of a European Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, as proposed
by Robert Badinter (10), could create the necessary conditions
for dealing with disputes on minority rights and frontiers in a
more conciliatory atmosphere than through armed force and United
Nations Security Council resolutions.

  At the same time, the establishment of a European stability
pact - of which only the outline is known at the moment -  could
oblige Central and Eastern European states to consider minority
problems in a larger framework of European security than, as is
now often the case, in a purely national perspective.  A system
where directly tangible economic advantages would be granted to
those nations to conclude comprehensive agreements on good
neighbourliness could be a strong incentive for civilised and
conciliatory behaviour.

  It should, however, be noted that any European stability pact
should take Russian interests into account.  Even if Russia does
not belong to the the group of countries having the intention of
joining the EC, it cannot be excluded from a European agreement
which envisages a solution to minority problems.



VI. Inviolability of borders
    ------------------------


  Since the initial phase of the conflict, the EC has insisted
on the principle that borders could not be changed by force. In
a declaration adopted at the opening of The Hague peace
conference on 7th September 1991, it was stated that internal
borders could not be changed by force.  Meeting in Bonn on 19th
November 1991, the WEU Council of Ministers "recalled and
confirmed the repeated statements by EC foreign ministers that
under no circumstances will territorial changes brought about by
force be recognised".  It seems difficult to speak more boldly!

  As quoted in Chapter V, one of the conditions for the
recognition of new states in Europe, as agreed by EC foreign
ministers on 16th December 1991, was acceptance of the
inviolability of frontiers which could be changed only through
peaceful means and by common agreement.

  After a meeting with Secretary of State, Warren Christopher,
in Luxembourg (11), the EC said in a statement that the Vance-
Owen plan had "no feasible alternative" and "remained the
centrepiece of EC strategy".


  On 19th June 1992, the WEU Council "recalled that territorial
gains or changes brought about by violence are unacceptable and
will not be recognised by the international community".

  At the London conference on 26th-27th August 1992, it was
again repeated that a political settlement of the conflict in
former Yugoslavia was to include respect for the integrity of
present frontiers unless changed by mutual agreement.

  The Vance-Owen plan, as presented on 2nd January 1993 at the
Geneva peace conference, which provided for a reorganisation of
Bosnia-Herzegovina into 10 provinces, was considered by many as
a major infringement of the principle of inviolability of
frontiers, because it tacitly endorsed territorial gains
obtained by force.

  As already known, the rejection by Bosnian Serbs of the Vance-
Owen plan in May 1993 later resulted in acceptance by the United
States, Russia, France, the United Kingdom and Spain of a joint
action plan for Bosnia which "temporarily", it was said,
accepted territorial gains made by force.  The plan called for
the creation of six "safe areas" (12) for Muslim civilians  on
the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina and for the use of United
States air power to protect United Nations peace-keepers in
those areas.  It was made clear, however, that the United States
would not come to the rescue of the safe areas themselves,
should they be attacked by Serbs, nor would they contribute
troops to the peace-keeping effort on the ground.

  It was said that the primary goal was no longer to roll back
territorial gains, but "to contain and stabilise the situation
and to put the brakes on the killing". (13)

  On the other hand, many agreed with the United States
Republican Senator, Bob Dole, who said that the plan amounted to
"writing off Bosnia as a state by ratifying the status quo on
the ground".

  Immediately after the adoption of the joint action plan, both
the United States and European governments tried to neutralise
criticism that they had in fact accepted territorial gains
obtained by force.  In Washington, the White House said that the
plan showed that the West was "refusing to accept territorial
gains in Bosnia (obtained) by aggression. (14)  In London, the
Foreign Ministry stated: "We do our utmost to get the Bosnian
Serbs to roll back their occupation", and "We do not accept that
aggression be rewarded". (15)

  The French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppe, denied that the
action plan was in any way a de facto recognition of Serbian
conquests, saying "Our aim is clear: to obtain withdrawal from
areas which have been occupied by force and to implement the
Vance-Owen plan". (16)

  No sooner had the action plan been adopted after weeks of
diplomatic negotiations than the western allies, sadly enough,
again demonstrated their main weakness: lack of resolve.

  Meeting in Brussels on 25th and 26th May 1993, they could not
reach a consensus on how the plan would be carried out, how many
troops would be required to protect the safe areas and which
countries would contribute the additional forces.  Of course,
difficult questions were involved such as how to co-ordinate
ground protection with air protection, how to fit that in with
the enforcement of a no-fly zone and which command arrangements
should be established.

  Many EC and NATO member states complained about not having
been consulted on the plan, others hesitated about sending more
troops.  The United States President had ruled out the
deployment of United States ground forces and rules of
engagement had yet to be established, requiring a change in the
rules governing the use of force by United States peace-keeping
troops.

  All Ministers agreed that no plans could be drawn up before a
United Nations Security Council resolution was passed defining
the safe area proposal. (17)

  Again, precious time was lost because of western reluctance
and hesitation to act decisively.

  And still, Thorvald Stoltenberg stated that the option of
using military force to end the conflict had not been abandoned
by the international community, though other means to achieve
peace would first be pursued.

  Les Aspin, the United States Defence Minister, was quoted as
having stated after the Brussels meeting:  "Working together is
a new element, the Serbs cannot any longer rely on divisions
between Russians, Europeans and Americans meaning no action."
(18)  One wonders whether this was meant to be a serious
statement.  Needless to say, fresh Serbian forces were sent into
the battle for Gorazde, one of the "safe areas", while Sarajevo
was heavily shelled, causing suspension of the humanitarian
airlift and the continuation attacks on aid convoys. (19)

  Following the uncertainty over the implementation of the joint
action plan, the EC Commissioner for external political
relations, Hans van den Broek, insisted that EC leaders should
urgently meet to discuss concrete steps, including military
action.  He also criticised the joint action plan which he
considered incompatible with the implementation of the Vance-
Owen plan and lacking any chance to be effective in the short or
even long term. (20)
  The United Kingdom Prime Minister, John Major, however, left
little doubt over allied intentions when he said the next day
that the allied powers were willing to tighten sanctions and
increase diplomatic pressure, but were not prepared to fight a
full-scale war.  He said "people are not prepared to put 200 000
troops in Bosnia to force them (the Serbs) back by armed force,
but we will maintain diplomatic pressure and we will not accept
the land gains by force". (21)  This is an acute reminder of the
strong diplomatic pressure which allowed Hitler to invade parts
of Czechoslovakia and Poland in 1938 and 1939.

  At a Franco-German summit on 2nd June 1993, both President
Mitterrand and the Chancellor Helmut Kohl again insisted that a
settlement must "guarantee the territorial integrity and
sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina". (22)

  Meeting in Athens on 10th June 1993 in the North Atlantic
Council, NATO's foreign ministers supported "the establishment
of safe areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina for the protection of the
civilian population as defined in United Nations Security
Council Resolutions 824 and 836".

  It then offered NATO's "protective airpower in case of attack
against UNPROFOR in the performance of its overall mandate, if
it so requests" and asked NATO's military authorities "to
proceed rapidly with detailed planning for the air support".

  Again, ministers confirmed that "The establishment of safe
areas is a temporary measure leading towards a negotiated
settlement based on the principles of the Vance-Owen plan which
guarantee the full sovereignty, territorial integrity and
political independence of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina".

  Not until 30th June 1993 did the NATO Permanent Council in
Brussels receive a detailed report from the Chairman of the
Military Committee on the planning for air support, including
rules of engagement.  It was decided to send the plans to the
capitals of NATO's member states for approval.  Some elements of
the plans were to be examined by the United Nations.

  After approval of the plans by the 16 member states, on 9th
July 1993 the NATO Permanent Council authorised SACEUR to start
the procedure for deployment of member states' fighter aircraft
to implement the decision on air support for UNPROFOR in its
protection mandate for the six safe areas.

  It should be noted that at that time, the 7 500 troops
required for implementing the safe areas plan on the ground, and
for whom the air support was being planned, were not yet
available.

  Finally, on 9th August 1993, the North Atlantic Council
approved the operational options for air strikes in Bosnia-
Herzegovina, but it immediately made it clear that the air
strikes foreseen were "limited to the support of humanitarian
relief, and must not be interpreted as a decision to intervene
militarily in the conflict".  A first NATO air support exercise
in a safe area was carried out on 18th August.

  Still, NATO's decision was immediately followed by an exchange
of statements between the UNPROFOR Commander in Bosnia-
Herzegovina and the United States which did not contribute to
the credibility of earlier threats.

  Only a few days later, on 20th August 1993, a compromise peace
plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina was presented by Lord Owen and
Thorvald Stoltenberg, leaving the Muslim-led Bosnian government
with about 30% of the territory, the Bosnian Serbs with 52% or
more and the Croats with 17% or more, in fact dividing the
republic into three different ethnic states.

  One cannot deny that whatever European governments say, an
immeasurable discrepancy can be noted between their theory and
their practice.

  Even if the maintenance of existing borders were to remain a
fundamental goal, other options including the change of borders
through peaceful negotiations and mutual agreement must be kept
open and may have to be pursued actively in order to prevent
conflict.  At the same time, it should be noted that most of the
minority problems, with the possible exception of those in
Macedonia and Kosovo, cannot be solved by changing borders.  In
all other cases, border changes with the aim of creating
ethnically pure states would have to be accompanied by mass
migrations.

  On the other hand, a change of borders in Kosovo would have
immediate consequences for relations between Albania and FYROM
and raise tension in all neighbouring countries.  If borders are
to be changed within Europe, there must be accompanying security
guarantees from their godfathers.  The example of Bosnia-
Herzegovina, where a new state was recognised, after which it
was neither protected nor allowed to defend itself with
appropriate means should never be repeated.

  Often, any proposal for changing borders is dismissed with the
argument that such changes would open a Pandora's box in the
whole of Europe.  Is not Pandora's box already wide open with
the international community's de facto acceptance of changing
borders by force and ethnic cleansing?

  The current policy is inconsistent.  Territorial changes may
have to be accepted and perhaps actively pursued if that can
help to prevent an armed conflict, but the new territorial
relations should always be backed by an agreed security
framework with satisfactory security guarantees.  The recent
history of the Saar shows clearly that territories can change
country by peaceful means.



VII. Sanctions
     ---------


  Sanctions as envisaged in Chapter VII of the United Nations
Charter will in future no doubt remain one of the main peaceful
instruments for carrying into effect Security Council decisions.
On the other hand, sanctions will have little effect if there
are no measures to enforce them.

  In the Yugoslav crisis, sanctions were imposed at a very early
stage, beginning with an arms embargo in September 1991,
followed by trade sanctions and an oil embargo later that year.
However, it was only in July 1992 that the first measures were
taken to police the sanctions by means of a combined WEU-NATO
air and sea operation in the Adriatic and even at that stage it
had no authority to stop vessels suspected of breaking
sanctions.  A fully-effective system for controling and
enforcing the embargo on the Danube came into effect only in
June 1993, almost two years after the imposition of sanctions.
Only then was a memorandum of understanding signed between WEU
and Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary allowing WEU to establish a
co-ordination and support centre in Calafat (Romania) and
control centres in Mohacs (Hungary) and Ruse (Bulgaria), while a
total of about 300 policemen and customs officers and 12 patrol
boats were sent in to provide assistance in the embargo
enforcement.

  Notwithstanding the extraordinary delays in the embargo
enforcement, there can be little doubt that the economy of
Serbia-Montenegro has been seriously affected by the embargo.
In 1992, there was a 56% decline in real wages.  Gross national
product is forecast to drop by about 30% in 1993 to around $8
billion.  According to official figures, the monthly inflation
rate reached 205.4% in May.

  Still, not even all EC members are determined to implement the
sanctions.  Greece has never been able to dispel charges that it
violated the embargo and there are many incidents giving proof
of its mischievious behaviour.

  On 8th December 1992, EC Foreign Ministers criticised Greece
for allowing Greek companies to violate United Nations sanctions
by shipping oil to Serbia, while at the same time withholding
oil from Macedonia, officially called FYROM.  Greece later
resumed oil supplies to FYROM, but in September 1993, it was
said that Greece had threatened to cut off all oil supplies to
FYROM unless half the supply, or more than 80 000 tons monthly,
was sent to Serbia. (23)

  Also, FYROM cannot claim to have a clean record concerning the
embargo either.  According to UNPROFOR, which monitors the
border between FYROM and Serbia, about 4000 trucks, including
those carrying oil products, construction materials and spare
parts for heavy machinery, made the crossing in both directions
every week. (24)  Only very recently, in October 1993, it was
reported that the government of FYROM, encouraged by the United
States, had finally decided to apply in practice the United
Nations Security Council Resolution 820 on the embargo against
Serbia and Montenegro. (25)  It is said that freight transport
between the two states has come to a standstill except for
lorries with authorisation from the United Nations sanctions
committee.  Even tanker lorries are now systematically being
stopped and sent back.  The government claims that the sanctions
cost the Macedonian economy more than $1.2 billion in 1992 and
$1.8 billion in 1993.  Some financial compensation may be
provided.  The EC had promised 100 million ecus in December
1992, but actual payment of this sum was delayed.  The economic
loss for FYROM caused by the embargo enforcement during the last
three months of 1993 is estimated at $1.8 billion, a sum which
might be compensated by the United States or by the postponement
of the country's external debt.

  It is suggested in Skopje that the United States could send
more troops to FYROM to reinforce the 325 United States troops
already deployed in that country, while the air force base of
Krivovalek has been put at the disposal of the United States.

  Other neighbouring countries are trying to implement the
embargo by all the means at their disposal, but they are all
complaining of heavy economic losses for which no compensation
has been provided.  Greece claims a loss of over $2.5 billion,
Hungary a loss of over $500 million and Romania and Bulgaria
have given figures of between $1 and 3 billion.  Recently, the
Bulgarian Prime Minister, Ljuben Berov, addressing the
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, estimated the
economic loss to his country caused by the United Nations
embargos against Iraq and against Serbia and Montenegro at more
than $6 billion.  He said that, until then, Bulgaria had
received no compensation whatever "except pats on the back by
way of consolation".  The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
claims a decline of 50% in its GNP, which has not been
compensated. (26)

  Even if some of these figures may be rough estimates and
exaggerated, it cannot be denied that economies which are
involved in a painful process of change towards a market-
oriented economy do not have enough reserves to face additional
problems.  A reasonable system may have to be worked out for the
international community to compensate countries which are hit
most severely by an embargo against an important neighbouring
trade partner, as happened during the Gulf war.

  Another important problem connected with sanctions is that it
is the population of the country envisaged that suffers the
most.  Of course, the reasoning behind the imposition of
sanctions is that a population, disgruntled by food shortages,
rampant inflation, unemployment and other devastating effects,
will revolt against its leaders and choose a new government
which should change the country's policy.  The trouble here is
that sanctions are always imposed upon nations with an
autocratic government which has a firm grip on the population
and where a real opposition does not exist.  The second world
war has shown that even more severe measures, such as the
bombing of cities, does not make such regimes change course.

  In conclusion, it should be said that sanctions remain an
essential instrument as backing for diplomatic arguments.  But
it is also vital for them to be enforced from the very beginning
and for possible negative consequences for neighbouring
countries to be taken into account.  Compensatory measures may
have to be considered.


VIII.  Peace-keeping or peace-making
       -----------------------------


  After the events of 1989, when security relations in Europe
started to change, the member states of both NATO and WEU
understood that they had to adapt their strategic concept and
armed forces.  Action was taken, and after thorough preparation,
a NATO summit was held in Rome in December 1991 where a
transformed NATO was presented to the world.

  Indeed, it is only two years ago, on 7th-8th November 1991,
that the heads of state and government of NATO's member states
agreed in Rome on the alliance's new strategic concept, yet it
now seems ages ago.  At that time, the Soviet Union still
existed, but rightly the Rome declaration stated that "the
threat of a simultaneous full-scale attack on all NATO's
European fronts has effectively been removed and no longer
provides the focus for allied strategy".

  On the other hand, it was stated that Soviet conventional and
nuclear capabilities had to be taken into account if stability
and security in Europe were to be preserved.

  In conclusion, it was therefore said that:

"Even in a non-adversarial and co-operative relationship, Soviet
military capability and build-up potential still constitute the
most significant factor of which the alliance has to take
account in maintaining the strategic balance in Europe."

  This was a good reason to maintain NATO's nuclear and
conventional forces, be it in slightly reduced size, in order to
guarantee and protect the territorial integrity of the member
states.

  But new threats and risks were emerging, even if their
importance and magnitude were not yet clearly visible, and the
Rome declaration referred to them as follows:

"On the other hand, there is a greater risk of different crises
arising, which could develop quickly and would require a rapid
response, but they are likely to be of a lesser magnitude."

  The risk of a "different crisis" had already materialised in
former Yugoslavia.  Indeed, it was still of a "lesser
magnitude", but it was developing quickly and required a rapid
response.

  On 27th October 1991, the Croatian Foreign Minister, Ivonimir
Separovic, wrote a letter to EC foreign ministers informing them
that since the beginning of July 5 000 people had been killed in
Croatia.  At that time, the International Committee of the Red
Cross estimated that more than 280 000 people had left their
homes during the period of fighting.  Both figures have been
dwarfed by what has happened since.

  In the Rome declaration, apart from the alliance's task "to
deter and defend against any threat of aggression against the
territory of any NATO member state", one of the other three
fundamental security tasks was formulated as follows:
"To provide one of the indispensable foundations for a stable
security environment in Europe, based on the growth of
democratic institutions and commitment to the peaceful
resolution of disputes, in which no country would be able to
intimidate or coerce any European nation or to impose hegemony
through the threat or use of force."

  Apparently, it was thought that NATO could play an eminent
role as a coherent and effective political organisation, when,
regarding the management of crises and conflict prevention, it
was stated that:

"In the new political and strategic environment in Europe, the
success of the alliance's policy of preserving peace and
preventing war depends even more than in the past on the
effectiveness of preventive diplomacy and successful management
of crises affecting the security of its members."

and further that:

"The success of alliance policy will require a coherent approach
determined by the alliance's political authorities choosing and
co-ordinating appropriate crisis management measures as required
from a range of political and other measures, including those in
the military field."

  With a touch of realism, ministers recognised that NATO might
not be able to do this alone.  They therefore added:

"The potential of dialogue and co-operation within all of Europe
must be fully developed in order to help defuse crises and to
prevent conflicts since the allies' security is inseparably
linked to that of all other states in Europe.  To this end, the
allies will support the role of the CSCE process and its
institutions.  Other bodies including the European Community,
Western European Union and United Nations may also have an
important role to play."

  In the chapter "Missions of alliance military forces", the
classic role of armed forces was confirmed:

"The primary role of alliance military forces, to guarantee the
security and territorial integrity of member states, remains
unchanged."

"In peace" it followed on "the role of allied military forces is
to guard against risks to the security of Alliance members; to
contribute towards the maintenance of stability and balance in
Europe; and to ensure that peace is preserved."

  Finally, it was established that:

"Allies could, further, be called upon to contribute to global
stability and peace by providing forces for United Nations
missions."

  Few people would have then dared to predict that within one
year this phrase was going to play an all-important role in
debates among allies over the possible role of military forces
in former Yugoslavia.

  One could argue that, in Rome, NATO had not yet completely
transformed itself into the perfect security organisation for
the coming decades, but that would be unfair.  Developments are
following in too-rapid succession to expect more than what was
achieved in Rome after thorough and serious preparations.

  Even so, the Rome declaration provides a fairly complete
catalogue of tasks and missions of the alliance and its military
forces, which should have allowed it to act effectively when it
became clear that the crisis in Yugoslavia was turning into a
savage war.

  Certainly, no satisfactory solution has yet been found to the
question whether NATO as such could operate out-of-area, but it
should be noted that this did not prevent militarily successful
operations in the Gulf war, where a number of NATO member states
co-operated with others to liberate Kuwait from the Iraqi
invaders.  Even if it was not a NATO operation, NATO assets,
NATO procedures and NATO experience contributed to its success.

  Meeting in Oslo on 4th June 1992, the North Atlantic Council
made it known that it was prepared "to support, on a case-by-
case basis in accordance with (its) own procedures, peace-
keeping activities under the responsibility of the CSCE,
including by making available Alliance resources and expertise".

  Later, on 19th June 1992 (the crisis in Yugoslavia had
meanwhile resulted in over 100 000 people killed and 2 500 000
refugees) the WEU Council issued the Petersberg declaration
which included new decisions on the strengthening of WEU's
operational role.  Here, WEU member states declared that they
were "prepared to make available military units from the whole
spectrum of their conventional armed forces for military tasks
conducted under the authority of WEU."

  Furthermore, it was stated that:

"Apart from contributing to the common defence in accordance
with Article 5 of the Washington Treaty and Article V of the
modified Brussels Treaty respectively, military units of WEU
member states, acting under the authority of WEU, could be
employed for:

-  humanitarian and rescue tasks;

-  peace-keeping tasks;

-  tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peace-
making.

  Meeting on the occasion of the Helsinki CSCE summit on 8th-
10th July 1992, foreign ministers of both NATO and WEU decided
that their troops would, on a case-by-case basis, be available
for peace-keeping activities under the responsibility of the
CSCE.

  Later, at their ministerial North Atlantic Council meeting in
Brussels on 17th December 1992, ministers decided to further
strengthen alliance co-ordination in peace-keeping and to
develop practical measures to enhance the alliance's
contribution in this area.  Ministers declared that they were
ready "to share experiences in peace-keeping with (their) co-
operation partners and other CSCE participating states, and to
join them as required in supporting CSCE peace-keeping
operations".

 They also confirmed the preparedness of the alliance to
"support, on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with our own
procedures, peace-keeping operations under the authority of the
United Nations Security Council".

  In the statement issued at the meeting of the North Atlantic
Co-operation Council (NACC) on 18th December 1992, it was said
that the countries participating in NACC would "exchange
experience and expertise on peace-keeping and related matters"
and that they would "continue (their) consultations leading to
co-operation on this subject in conformity with the work plan".

(a)  State of affairs in preparing for the peace-keeping roles
  of NATO and WEU

  Even if a framework of good intentions and availability has
been created in the North Atlantic Council's political decisions
and statements, officials at NATO headquarters note that the
Alliance does not yet have a detailed set of principles and
policies for peace-keeping.  One issue at stake is the
implications for defence planning and security, if the same
assets may be used for different purposes.  These are certainly
subjects which should be addressed at the forthcoming NATO
summit meeting in January 1994.

  It is clear, however, that NATO's primary role will remain the
security of its members.  If NATO is to assume peace-keeping
roles, it does not intend to be at the beck and call of the
whole world, nor will it act on its own responsibility.  On the
other hand, NATO rightly argues that it has unique capabilities
to offer for peace-keeping, such as an airborne early warning
system, command, control and communications, multinational
forces, interoperability, well-trained troops with more than
half of its member states having extensive peace-keeping
experience, a unique scale and degree of readiness and planning
capability.

  On 18th December 1992, the NACC decided to establish an ad-hoc
group on co-operation in peace-keeping with the aim of
developing a common understanding of the political principles of
and the tools for peace-keeping, and to share experience and
thereby develop common practical approaches and co-operation in
support of peace-keeping under the responsibility of the United
Nations or the CSCE.

  The ad-hoc group drafted principles which were agreed by the
permanent North Atlantic Council and its co-operation partners
on 15th March 1993.  This document, notwithstanding NATO's own
assertion that it is still lacking detailed principles and
policies for peace-keeping, contains what is ostensibly an
almost exhaustive compilation of definitions, general
principles, criteria and operational principles, guidelines,
measures and elements.

  As regards co-operation to prepare for possible CSCE peace-
keeping operations, a total of 41 nations have now subscribed to
this initiative, including all the NACC member states as well as
Sweden, Finland and Austria.  Representatives from both the CSCE
and the United Nations have been invited.  At this stage, an
operational planning group does not yet exist, but there is an
ambitious co-operation programme, including such issues as
training, logistics, national planning and also technical and
doctrinal questions.

  According to WEU's Secretary-General, the operational
organisation of WEU is still in a preliminary phase.  An
inventory of forces answerable to WEU is now being prepared.
These forces are mainly to be deployed for humanitarian and
peace-keeping tasks. The Defence Representatives Group is
preparing general rules and procedural guidelines for relations
between these forces and WEU.  Meanwhile, WEU takes the view
that the involvement of the United States in Europe's security
is vitally important.

  Therefore, in any situation where Europe's security is under
threat, the preliminary question should be whether the United
States is prepared to be involved in operations to counter the
threat.  If the United States agrees to be involved, a NATO
operation can take place.  If on the other hand the United
States does not want to be involved, then WEU and the EC can act
on their own.  Depending on the requirements for the operation,
WEU could then be self-reliant or play the leading role. There
is a growing consensus that in such circumstances, NATO should
make resources and assets available to WEU, such as the NATO
AWACS and other infrastructure, a matter that was again
discussed recently by NATO's Defence Ministers at Travemuende on
20th-21st Octber 1993.  As the Secretary-General, Mr. van
Eekelen, said, there is a growing feeling that Europeans will
have to learn to take the main responsibility for handling
problems which they can no longer expect Americans to solve for
them.  In that case, it would be only logical that NATO should
be ready to help Europe, also if it is deploying a WEU force to
handle a regional crisis, by lending its assets which are
lacking in WEU's operational organisation, such as real-time
intelligence, integrated command and control and airlift.
Meanwhile, WEU should give serious consideration to how it can
become self-reliant in some respects, such as airlift and
satellite reconnaissance.


(b)  NATO and WEU operations in former Yugoslavia


  With the abovementioned statements in mind, it is interesting
if not revealing to note what NATO and WEU are actually doing to
promote or keep peace in former Yugoslavia.

  Actual activities are the following:

(i)  Implementing decisions taken by Foreign Ministers in
Helsinki on 10th July 1992: both a NATO and a WEU naval force
are enforcing compliance with the United Nations Security
Council resolutions concerning the United Nations economic
embargo on Serbia and Montenegro and the arms embargo against
all the republics of former Yugoslavia.  For this operation,
detailed co-ordination arrangements have been worked out between
NATO and WEU military officials, including co-ordination of
areas of responsibility, methods of operation, communications,
air surveillance, support and oil supply.

(ii)  In a joint action with Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary, WEU
is enforcing the embargo against Serbia and Montenegro on the
Danube.

(iii)  UNPROFOR is using elements from NATO's NORTHAG command
for its operational headquarters in Kiseljalc.

(iv)  Following a North Atlantic Council decision of 8th April
1992, NATO is enforcing the no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina
as imposed by the United Nations Security Council Resolution
816.

(v)  On 9th August 1993, the North Atlantic Council approved the
"operational options for air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina",
enabling air support for humanitarian relief.

  Why did NATO not do more?  At NATO headquarters, a number of
arguments are being put forward which have prevented the
deployment of peace-keeping forces.

  The first argument is that a massive operation with NATO
deploying ground troops for peace-keeping is considered by many
as a major test of NATO's capability as a security organisation.
Any failure to pass this test, so it is said, would mean the end
of NATO.  As a consequence, great caution is being taken in the
making the most thorough preparations, including painstaking
negotiations over the mandate for such an operation and the
duration of the commitment, all needed to establish a proper
planning programme.  Further it is said that a clear political
objective, which is a main condition for any military operation
to be successful, is still lacking.  No clarity has yet been
obtained over who will be responsible for the cost of a massive
peace-keeping operation, which NATO is estimating at $8.25
billion a year.  The United Nations, it is said at NATO, should
allow its member states to consider their contribution to such
operations as payment in kind.

  There are also indications that some of NATO's member states
have problems in providing troops for the simple reason that,
with so many different United Nations operations going on, they
do not have enough resources in troops.  Some member states even
feel that they may have to revise their armed forces
restructuring programme if United Nations peace-keeping is to
require continuous large scale commitments.

  Following a request from NATO's Permanent Council on 15th
September 1993, the organisation's military authorities have
started preliminary contingency planning for possible
implementation by NATO of the military aspects of a United
Nations peace-keeping plan which would come into force if the
different parties to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina sign a
peace agreement and the United Nations turns to NATO for support
for the plan's implementation.  The planning envisages a force
of 50 000 men, half of whom should be provided by the United
States.  It should be noted that many important issues still
have to be settled.  The military believe that the political
objectives and rules of engagement must be established clearly
before the start of any intervention.  Some NATO members such as
France, the United Kingdom and Canada, would prefer to see major
United Nations involvement in the command and control of any
peace-keeping mission, while the United States is in favour of a
NATO command, dominated by the United States military, in any
peace-keeping operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Most, if not
all, member states want to send troops for only a limited
period.
  Finally, it is observed that it has been extremely difficult
to reach a consensus among NATO's member states on all the
different issues relating to a peace-keeping operation as now
envisaged, although this is essential for any NATO operation on
the territory of former Yugoslavia.

  WEU, it should be recognised, has not done much more than
NATO, but the embargo enforcing operations in the Adriatic and
on the Danube are successful.

  Asked why WEU did not do more, the Secretary-General, Mr. van
Eekelen, pointed out that WEU's operational organisation is only
in its infancy and that there were no resources to do much more.
He noted that WEU has now become one of the players in security
matters, but the United Nations has taken the lead, providing
legitimacy for all operations.  The United Nations has now asked
NATO to provide peace-keeping forces in the event of a peace
agreement between the parties to the conflict in Bosnia-
Herzegovina implementing the Owen-Stoltenberg plan.  In that
framework, WEU may be asked to participate in the rotation of
forces in the long term.  WEU is now drawing up a plan to solve
the practical problems for the EC's administration of Mostar.
The WEU Planning Cell is examining the possibility of
establishing a WEU police force in Mostar and the re-
establishment of public, in particular medical, services in the
city.


(c)  The future of peace-keeping in former Yugoslavia


  Lord Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg, when visiting NATO on 22nd
September 1993, said that the peace-keeping operation in Bosnia-
Herzegovina should be accomplished by a credible force, more
powerful than the lightly armed United Nations peace-keeping
force deployed in Bosnia for a humanitarian mission.

  NATO's Secretary-General, Manfred Woerner, has made it clear
that NATO will not and cannot enforce a peace plan if the United
States does not participate in te peace-keeping forces.  He
believes that the United States administration is still willing
to provide troops for an operation under NATO command, but on
the other hand, he thinks that after the casualties among United
States forces in Somalia and the failed effort to land United
States peace-keepers in Haiti, the administration might have
trouble in securing the agreement of the United States Congress
and Senate.

  Indeed, after the rejection by the Bosnian parliament, at the
end September 1993, of the last Owen Stoltenberg peace plan, the
chances for a peace-keeping force seem rather remote.  In fact,
one political commentator was most probably right when he
bluntly said that the Bosnian Parliament's rejection of the
peace plan was greeted with thinly-disguised relief in Europe as
well as in the United States.

  The most recent pirouette in Europe's ballet of hesitations
over military operations in former Yugoslavia was again
illustrative of a general attitude of long standing.

  On 25th October 1993, President Francois Mitterrand stated on
French television: "A major demonstration must be made...In
November a humanitarian path will have to be forced towards
Sarajevo".

  At the EC's summit meeting in Brussels on 29th October 1993,
however, President Mitterrand told the heads of government that
he had not been understood correctly and that the question was
not one of using force in this operation.  Later that day, the
summit meeting decided to use all appropriate means for ensuring
the delivery of humanitarian assistance and not, as proposed by
France, "all the means available for ensuring" which would have
included the United Nations authorisation to use force and
NATO's offer for aerial protection of the UNPROFOR. (27)

  As matters now stand, many have started to consider former
Yugoslavia as a specific case where none of the CSCE principles,
nor of its conflict prevention procedures, nor the United
Nations Charter's procedures set out in Chapter VI and VII can
be successful and where all allied American and European ideas
and proposals for peace-keeping and peace-making are doomed to
fail.  They think it is a hornet's nest where a military
operation to keep peace or enforce a peace agreement could
easily deteriorate into combat operations with inevitable
casualties.  Not one organisation or country has been able to
provide a solution or bring the conflicting parties to reason.
Those who have not tried yet are afraid of losing their
credibility once they become involved.  These could be reasons
why western governments have tacitly abandoned Yugoslavia to
itself, decided to let the conflict follow its natural course
while hoping that a stage of pure fatigue will be reached when
the only real option left for all parties will be to stumble or
drag themselves to the negotiation table where Lord Owen and
Thorvald Stoltenberg will hold their hands to sign the ultimate
peace plan.

  What remains in former Yugoslavia?

  If Western Europe and the United States have almost given up
hope of keeping or securing peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, there
still remains Croatia, Kosovo, Sandjak and the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).

  In Croatia, the situation is volatile. The United Nations
peace-keeping force is not implementing its official mandate
which is to keep both sides behind their previous confrontation
line, secure the cease-fire agreement and put Serbian heavy arms
in storage.  Recently, the Commander-in-Chief of UNPROFOR warned
that Serbs and Croats are again on the brink of war.

  In Kosovo, the civil, human and national rights of two million
Albanians who form 92% of the Kosovo population, have been
abrogated by Serbia in 1989.  Under the 1974 Yugoslav
Constitution, Kosovo had wide powers of self-rule as an
autonomous province of the republic of Serbia.  Local Albanians
were given control over most aspects of public life.  This all
came to an end when President Milosevic of Serbia revoked
Kosovo's autonomy, dissolved the regional parliament and made
the region an integral part of Serbia.  Martial law has now been
imposed.  Education in the Albanian language has been suspended.
More than half of the Albanians have been summarily dismissed
from their jobs and nearly 300 000 Albanians have been forced to
flee Kosovo.  Serbian military units surround most of Kosovo's
major cities and towns with their artillery guns ready to
target.  Serbian paramilitary forces are harassing and
intimidating the Albanian population under the inspiring
leadership of Zeljko Raznjatovic, also called Arkan, wanted for
murder and other crimes by several Western European countries.
In a report, released by Amnesty International on 12th October,
it is said that tension is still growing in Kosovo where a
dangerous mixture of ethnic tension, rage and years of abuse in
silence is fermenting. (28)

  It has been suggested that the Serbs should start to discuss
limited restoration of autonomy for Kosovo, but the Albanians
are no longer interested in such a solution.  They are demanding
an independent Kosovo.  It is generally believed that the
dispute over Kosovo can easily turn into a war, maybe even with
the active participation of Albanians living in neighbouring
countries such as Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia (FYROM).  Some suggest that even Albania, FYROM,
Bulgaria, Greece and perhaps Turkey may become involved in the
fighting.  One has to hope that this will not happen, but it
cannot be excluded completely.

  Nevertheless, the situation is sufficiently threatening to
require immediate and decisive action by the international
community with Europe in the lead.

  It has been argued that nothing can be done in Kosovo, because
it is an internal dispute on Serbian territory, which would
preclude foreign intervention.  It should be noted, however,
that the actual situation in Kosovo fully justifies
international action in accordance with Chapters VI and VII of
the United Nations Charter since it is unequivocally a dispute
"the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance
of international peace and security", as mentioned in Article 33
of the Charter.

  Application of all different actions enumerated in the
abovementioned Chapters of the United Nations Charter, including
the deployment of peace-keeping forces, would therefore be fully
legitimate.

  In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), the
situation is not much better.  It has declared its independence
and has been admitted as a member of the United Nations, but its
official name, challenged by Greece, is still being negotiated
with Greece in talks sponsored by the United Nations.  The new
Greek Prime Minister, Andreas Papandreou, has however announced
that Greece will pull out of these talks.

  On 12th October 1993, Belgium officially recognised FYROM as a
sovereign and independent state.  The Greek Ministry for Foreign
Affairs immediately issued a protest, stating that the "Greek
partners in the EC should seriously consider Athens' views" on
the "Macedonian question" and should respect "the principle of
solidarity" in the EC.

  With a total population of just over 2 million, FYROM has a
number of minorities, the most important of which are the
approximately 400 000 Albanians living in the area adjacent to
Kosovo and Albania, 90 000 Turks and 50 000 Serbs.  In
particular, the Albanians, who are participating in the present
government, may cause problems in the future.  They have been
proposing the creation of an autonomous Albanian region and also
the federalisation of FYROM.
  At the moment, within the framework of UNPROFOR, a Nordic
battalion and a United States contingent of 315 troops are
deployed along the Macedonian-Serbian border in order to prevent
the armed conflict in former Yugoslavia spilling over into
FYROM.


(d)  Peace-keeping in Europe and other possible areas of
conflict.


  While there is little prospect of extending peace-keeping
operations in former Yugoslavia, rightly or wrongly, might there
be other disputes or armed conflicts in Europe where the western
alliance, whether in the NATO or WEU framework, would be
prepared to intervene militarily at an early stage under the
authority of the United Nations or the CSCE in order to keep or
enforce peace while such action was still possible with an
appropriate display of force and without the risk of heavy
casualties?

  An increasing number of ministerial and other meetings in all
existing security organisations are being devoted to the many
different aspects of peace-keeping.  This creates the impression
that huge forces are being prepared for operations in all the
regions in Europe and in other continents where conflicts are
raging or where fragile cease-fires or peace agreements have to
be monitored.  Is that really true?

  Let us first look more closely at the catalogue of other areas
of conflict and hotbeds of tension in Europe or at Europe's
border which are, or recently were, on special offer for peace-
keeping and peace-making.  A valuable catalogue can be found in
the statements issued at the meetings of the North Atlantic Co-
operation Council (NACC) which keeps an annotated record of
conflicts in its member states.

  The last NACC statement issued in Athens on 11th June 1993
mentions the following conflicts where arms had been or were
being used and where, theoretically, the deployment of peace-
keeping forces may be required.

(i)  Nagorno-Karabakh

  NACC stated that the CSCE conference in Minsk offers the best
chance for a lasting solution, it supports United Nations
Security Council Resolution 822 and calls for the immediate
cessation of hostilities and for the withdrawal of all occupying
forces from recently-occupied districts of Azerbaijan.  At the
moment, there is little hope that the conflict will be solved
soon and fighting continues.  In a declaration in Paris on 15th
October 1993, the Prime Minister of Nagorno-Karabakh, Robert
Kotcharian, declared that his country would continue to fight
for its rights until it obtained satisfaction on all the issues
involved.

  Russian hardliners are backing the Armenians in their fight
for control of Nagorno-Karabakh and independent witnesses have
reported Russian logistical support, but there is little
evidence of any direct Russian involvement.  On the other hand,
Russia is worried about possible fundamentalist influence in
mainly Muslim Azerbaijan.  The armed forces of Azerbaijan have
been soundly defeated and the current talks are the best chance
for peace.  The new Azeri government appears to be ready to
relinquish Nagorno-Karabakh in all but name, but much depends on
Armenian acceptance of the need to withdraw from other parts of
Azerbaijan.

(ii) Georgia

  NACC appealed to the parties concerned to respect an effective
cease-fire in the Abkhazian Autonomous Republic of Georgia and
refrain from all actions which could complicate a constructive
dialogue and the achievement of a durable settlement.  It also
believed that it was important to pursue a full settlement of
Georgian-Ossetian relations in the zone of conflict of Georgia.

  What has happened since that statement was issued?  In
September 1993, Abkhaz forces backed by Russian troops and
volunteers from the North Caucasus, all in possession of large
quantities of modern and sophisticated military equipment,
launched a surprise attack on Sukhumi, the last remaining
Georgian stronghold in Abkhazia, violating a Russian-brokered
cease-fire agreement signed on 28th July last.

  On 4th October, the Abkhaz Defence Minister announced that all
remaining pockets of Georgian resistance had been liquidated,
and that Abkhaz troops were in complete control of the region.
There were reports of ethnic cleansing and of more than one
hundred thousand refugees.

  Meanwhile, troops loyal to Zviad Gamsakhurdia, President
Shevardnadze's rival and predecessor, occupied a number of
strategic towns in the west of Georgia, and were continuing with
their offensive.  Mr. Gamsakhurdia has declared that Georgia
will be cleansed of Eduard Shevardnadze's supporters, adding
that he would resume his "lawful presidency" by "all possible
means". (29)

  Until recently, Russian assistance to the Abkhazians was
matched by an absence of support for Georgia.  With an economy
which has almost ground to a complete standstill and moving
towards dismemberment, Georgia is indeed close to collapse as a
functioning state.  The Georgian army has virtually
disintegrated and can no longer fight on its own.

  Under these circumstances, on 18th October 1993 Eduard
Shevardnadze made an urgent appeal to the governments of Russia,
Armenia and Azerbaijan to send the necessary military
contingents to guarantee the normal function of vital arteries
from the Black Sea to Tbilisi.

  Since then, covert Russian military assistance has turned the
tide and it is reported that rebel forces are now retreating.
(30) The Russian assistance, although publicly denied in Moscow,
came only after Mr. Shevardnadze had decided that Georgia should
join the Commonwealth of Independent states.

  In two other troubled areas on Georgian territory, there is
still no guarantee of lasting peace.

  South Ossetia, an autonomous region, after repeated outbursts
of violence during 1991, declared its independence on 21st
December of that same year, and confirmed an earlier resolution
on unification with Russia.  Fighting continued and President
Shevardnadze accused Russia of exacerbating the situation by
helping the South Ossetians with troops and equipment.
Meanwhile, the speaker of the Russian parliament accused Georgia
of the "genocide of the South Ossetian people".  According to a
cease-fire agreement concluded in June 1992, Russia would
withdraw its military units from the region while a monitoring
committee would oversee the peace.

  In the autonomous region of Adjaria, a comparative peace has
been observed although it is distrustful of the central Georgian
government.  The lack of a common border with Russia, however,
offers few prospects for a successful independence movement.

  It is argued that Georgia is of minimal strategic importance
to the West and Russia can be left to deal with security
problems in that region.

  The only way to stop the continuing violence would be to
introduce buffer forces from outside.  Both politically and
militarily, these can only be Russian forces.  The United
States, supported by Germany, indeed excludes any such action
other than that taken by the Russians.  The official view of the
Russian government on how the conflict should be solved is
unclear and contradictory statements are being issued. (31)

  All this is happening in a country where the President is a
former Soviet foreign minister, well respected in the West as
the co-architect of glasnost and of a number of important arms
control agreements.  Moreover, Georgia is a member state of the
United Nations, CSCE and NACC.  There is no clarity over its CIS
membership.  Where else are western alliance troops going to
intervene for the sake of peace and democracy if not in Georgia?

(iii) Tajikistan

  NACC urged the parties involved in the continuing political
and armed confrontation to settle their differences through
dialogue and work together for the peaceful and democratic
development in their country.  It supported the efforts of the
international community in this regard.

  Last year, a power struggle developed into an all-out civil
war which left at least 20 000 people killed and more than half
a million forced to flee their homes.  The real figures are not
known and some suggested that between 30 000 and 50 000 were
killed.  The present government, headed by Imoli Rakhmonov,
considered to be a hard-line communist, has annihilated the
opposition.

  With the West's tacit agreement, Russia is maintaining an
armed force of more then 20 000 in support of the present
government and with the primary mission of keeping fighters,
weapons and drugs from entering Afghanistan.  Fighting at
Tajikistan's southern border is reported almost daily.  Both
Russia and the West claim that the present situation is
preferable to what they see as the alternative; a government
under the influence of radical Islamic elements from abroad.

  Still, the conflict in Tajikistan is not between different
ethnic groups, nor between communism and Islamic fundamentalism,
but rather a struggle for political power between different
clans.

(iv)  Moldova

  NACC welcomed the stabilisation of the situation in the left
bank Dniestr region of Moldova following the agreement reached
on 21st July 1992.  A permanent settlement was considered
essential.  It supported the early and complete withdrawal of
foreign troops from Moldova in the context of appropriate
bilateral agreements without additional linkage to other issues.

  Ethnic Russians and Ukrainians have been the main supporters
of the proclamation of the Trans Dniestr republic, followed by a
military campaign to take control of their republic.  On 21st
July 1992, a peace agreement was signed, giving the Trans
Dniestr region special status and the right to self-
determination should Moldova unite with Romania.  Russian,
Moldovan and Trans Dniestr peace-keeping troops began enforcing
a cease-fire and talks began on the withdrawal of Russian forces
already in the region.  In both Moldova and Romania, there is
concern over the continuing presence in Moldova of the Russian
14th Army under Lieutenant-General Aleksandr Lebedev, who
considers it his main job to support the Trans Dniestr republic
against Moldova.  This is the more worrying since the General
has openly declared "Theoretically we are under the orders of
the commander-in-chief of ground forces in Moscow.  In practice,
we take decisions here." (32)  It should be noted that in
future, the existence of an officially independent republic of
Trans Dniestr would immediately be challenged by Ukraine.

  Despite the volatile situation in Moldova, it is extremely
unlikely, if not completely excluded, that NATO or WEU peace-
keeping forces will be sent to that region, when Russian forces
are doing the job which they deem necessary in their own or
their country's interest.

(v)  Other regional disputes

  The NACC catalogue further mentions the withdrawal of foreign
troops from the Baltic states, which has since almost been
accomplished and the need to conclude, without delay, the
appropriate bilateral agreements in each case.

  Finally, it welcomes all practical steps leading to the
solution of existing differences between Russia and Ukraine
including those related to the Black Sea fleet and nuclear
issues.  It is widely recognised that both states have a common
interest in solving their differences through negotiations, even
if recently-concluded agreements were in the air again after a
few days, as has been the case before.

  Still, relations between Russia and Ukraine have not been
stablilised.  Apart from the many economic disputes, there are
disputes over the Black Sea fleet and strategic nuclear weapons.

  Repeatedly, summit talks between Ukraine's President Leonid
Kravchuk and Russia's President Boris Yeltsin resulted in a
settlement over the status of the Black Sea fleet which appeared
to be void within days.  Agreements in Dagomys in June 1992 to
split the fleet, in Yalta in August 1992 to place the fleet
under the joint command of both presidents and in Moscow in June
1993 to split the fleet on a 50-50 basis, with joint use of
Sevastopol were never implemented.

  At a recent summit meeting in Massandra on 3rd September, it
was decided that Ukraine would give up its entitlement to half
the 300 vessel fleet in exchange for which Russia would write
off Ukraine's debts to it for oil, gas and electricity,
estimated at $2.5 billion.  A joint Ukrainian-Russian Commission
has been set up for more detailed discussion, but there is
little chance of the Massandra agreement being implemented after
the Ukrainian government was heavily criticised over the
compromise.

  Behind the dispute over the Black Sea fleet is the most
explosive problem of control of Sevastopol, its Crimean
headquarters and the Crimea itself which, with its majority
Russian population, was given to Ukraine in 1954.

  With its 176 strategic missiles and 1 656 nuclear weapons,
Ukraine is the third largest nuclear power in the world.
President Kravchuk has obliged his country to accede to the 1991
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) and to become a non-
nuclear power according to the 1992 Lisbon protocol, but Ukraine
has not yet ratified or implemented these agreements.  Ukraine
is now trying to use its nuclear weapons as bargaining chips to
obtain economic aid and security guarantees from the West. It is
claiming $2.5 billion for dismantling its nuclear weapons.  In
October 1993, President Kravchuk declared that Ukraine should
keep its 46 modern SS-24 missiles as a means of pressure. (33)
  This concludes the list of hotspots mentioned by NACC.  What
is left?

(vi)  Central Europe

  In Central Europe, important Polish and Hungarian minorities
live in neighbouring countries.  Poland has succeeded in
concluding agreements on good neighbourliness and co-operation
with Belarus and Ukraine, where there are 600 000 and 500 000
Poles living respectively.  It is negotiating an agreement with
Lithuania, where there are 350 000 Poles.  Apparently,
negotiations are not easy but there are good reasons to be
optimistic.  All in all, there is little reason to consider
Poland as a country where peace-keeping forces will have to be
deployed.

  Hungary is facing a more complicated situation.  The 3 million
ethnic Hungarians living outside Hungary in neighbouring
countries form the largest single minority in Central Europe.
The Hungarian government has advocated substantial local
autonomy for these Hungarians.  In 1992, the Hungarian Defence
Minister, Lajos Fur, declared in an interview that his country's
security policies took into account Hungarians living outside
its borders.  Since then, Prime Minister, Jozsef Antall, has
taken pains not to further deteriorate relations with
neighbouring countries and, in general, the situation is now
more positive.   Most worrying is the position of the 350 000
Hungarians still living in Vojvodina, a formerly autonomous
region in Serbia, which was deprived of this statute in 1989.
The Hungarian government considers the presence in Vojvodina of
paramilitary Serbian forces without proper political control to
be a risk for the Hungarian minority.

  The adoption of the common action plan in Washington is a
matter of concern for Hungary, which could only conclude that
the international community has accepted Milosevic's policy of
ethnic cleansing and changing borders by force.  The Serbian
government has said that, since the beginning of the conflict,
300 000 Serbian refugees from Bosnia and Croatia have settled in
Vojvodina, thus increasing the Serbian part of the population
from 60% to 80%.

  There are many signs of growing discrimination against
Hungarians in Vojvodina.  Many are dismissed from their job, the
use of the Hungarian language in courts has been restricted and
on 1st July last a law on higher education was passed by the
Serbian parliament according to which secondary teacher training
for Hungarian teachers was eliminated.  This, together with a
climate of growing intimidation may lead to a silent and non-
violent but determined process of ethnic cleansing, causing
Hungarians to leave Vojvodina for lack of reliable future
prospects.

  The Hungarian Government has drawn these developments to the
attention of the international community without obtaining any
positive response.  In Hungary, it is thought that the lack of
response from the international community might lead other
countries with Hungarian minorities to follow the Serbian
example.

  More than 500 000 ethnic Hungarians live in the Republic of
Slovakia, where they represent about 11% of the population,
concentrated mostly in a region along Slovakia's southern
border.

  During the most difficult phase of the dispute between Hungary
and Slovakia over the Gabcikovo dam on the Danube, it was feared
that there might be negative repercussions on the Hungarian
minority in Slovakia, but since then both countries agreed on
5th April 1993 to take this dispute to the international court
of justice in The Hague, following mediation by the European
Commission.  They also agreed to hold regular meetings at the
level of Prime Ministers on other bilateral issues, including
the treatment of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia.

  The Hungarian minority of 1.7 million living in Romania has
been a continuing source of tension between the two neighbouring
countries since the downfall of communism.  Last September,
however, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Gezra Jeszenszky, paid
an official visit to Romania, meeting his Romanian counterpart
Teodor Melescanu in order to prepare a bilateral treaty
including the issues of minority treatment and stability of
borders.  Romania's imminent membership of the Council of
Europe, achieved on 28th September 1993, and Mr. Melescanu's
pragmatic vision have played an important role in the
improvement of relations between the two countries and a
satisfactory solution of the main outstanding questions is
expected.

  After fierce debates in parliament, the bilateral treaty
between Hungary and Ukraine has been ratified.  In this treaty,
both countries have agreed to respect each other's territorial
integrity, confirming that they have no territorial claims.
They have also committed themselves to ensure that minority
rights will be respected and that their ethnic, cultural,
linguistic and religious identities are preserved.

(e)  What are the chances?

  What must be the conclusion of this succinct review of
possible conflicts and candidate regions or countries, where
peace-keeping forces may have to be deployed?

(i)  Peace-keeping in the independent republics of the former
Soviet Union

  Almost without exception, these republics are facing
instability, ethnic strife or other forms of internal conflict.
Even if protests were made when some time ago Russia claimed
exclusive rights for peace-making in the states which formerly
belonged to the Soviet Union, neither the United States, nor any
Western European or even Central European country would even
think of intervening in one of these countries in order to keep,
restore or enforce peace.

  In his recent address to the United Nations General Assembly,
the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev, asked for
endorsement and funding for Russian intervention in former
Soviet republics.  Among other things, he said: "Conscious of
its particular responsibility for maintaining peace, Russia has
made peace-keeping and the protection of human rights,
particularly those of national minorities, key priorities of its
foreign policy, first of all in the territory of the former
Soviet Union." (34)

  Russia, for many reasons, is extremely sensitive over any
possibility of outside involvement in the security affairs of
former Soviet republics.

  In their reaction to this proposal, American officials
declared that the Clinton administration in no way conceded
special Russian rights on that country's borders.  This may be
true, but on the other hand, recent documents and statements by
United States administration officials demonstrate that, in
practice, the United States will be extremely reluctant to
intervene actively on the territory of the former Soviet Union.
As regards peace-keeping on the territory of the former Soviet
Union, the following points have been stressed:

-  The United States does not seek to intercede in or formally
mediate conflicts in the former Soviet Union.  It is ready to
help diplomatically if all parties to a conflict so wish.
-  The United States will not act on its own, but concentrate on
co-operation in international organisations like the United
Nations and CSCE.

-  The United States has no intention of becoming involved in
conflicts within the Russian Federation, nor of intervening in
domestic Russian politics.

-  The United States will not make aid conditional upon its
judgment of Russia's policy and behaviour towards other newly
independent states. (35)

(ii)  Peace-keeping in the nine Central European states

  It is highly unlikely that any peace-keeping operation will
have to be concluded on their territory.  Each of them is a
member of CSCE and NACC.  This in itself is not a guarantee that
they will not embark on the use of force to solve disputes.  On
the other hand, most of them are now members of the Council of
Europe which feels very strongly about democracy, the right of
minorities and, in general, about the rule of law.  None of
these states would like to be expelled from the Council of
Europe because of misbehaviour and it is, therefore, clearly
understood that they will do everything to be considered as
civilised and well-respected nations. States which are not
members have applied for membership and they will no doubt do
everything possible to meet the Council of Europe's conditions.
Moreover, all these states hope to be admitted sooner or later
to the EC with which some have and others will conclude
association agreements.  In this framework, they have already
become partners in WEU's Forum of Consultation.


(f)  Conclusion


  As demonstrated in this chapter, since the end of the cold war
and increasingly so after the beginning of the conflict in
former Yugoslavia, extensive debates over peace-keeping and
peace-enforcing have started in all international organisations
dealing with peace and security.  Many summits of heads of state
and government, ministerial meetings and countless meetings of
officials are devoted to this subject.  Documents full of
definitions, principles, criteria and guidelines have been
drafted and agreed to.  Whenever a specific action is
considered, many more meetings are devoted to drafting political
objectives, mandates and rules of engagement.  Of course, it
would be irresponsible to deploy armed forces in peace-keeping
operations without thorough preparation and common agreement on
all these essential elements.

  But increasingly, one cannot avoid the impression that these
endless preparations and negotiations, leading to postponement
and cancellation of operations, are part of an ingenious web of
tergiversations allowing in particular Western European
governments to avoid tackling the basic question:  are Western
European democracies prepared to commit their armed forces to
peace-keeping operations if there is a genuine risk of them
being drawn into combat with the likelihood of casualties?

  If governments think that Europe's democracies cannot sustain
casualties in their armed forces when not operating in defence
of national or allied territory or in defence of their vital
economic interests, they should consider the consequences and
draw their conclusions.

  One consequence may be that no peace-keeping operation with
the participation of Western European forces will be possible
without the deployment of a massive superiority in troops and
equipment.

  Another consequence may be that any successful terrorist or
combat action against such peace-keeping forces causing a
significant number of casualties, or even the credible threat of
such action, can cause the withdrawal of peace-keepers and
cancellation of the whole operation.  In practice, this could
lead to a situation where large parts of the world will be
abandoned to their fate.

  The classic argument for armed forces mainly consisting of
conscripts has always been that this largely contributes to the
creation of a national consensus on all matters concerning
national defence or the defence of a nation's vital interests.
If, as many are claiming, defence of national or allied
territory is replaced by peace-keeping in regions outside the
national or allied territory as the main activity of armed
forces, the basic reason for conscription is not just losing its
value, it is also becoming an obstacle to allowing armed forces
to perform their new tasks.  Western European governments may
have to abandon their conscript armed forces and concentrate on
the creation of entirely professional armies, which are better
prepared to be deployed and do the jobs for which they have been
hired and well trained.  Some governments have already reached
this decision, others will have to follow.  Opponents of
professionalisation often argue that such armed forces are not
cheaper, they are perhaps even more expensive.  But what is the
use of large budgets for maintaining conscript armed forces if
they are no use for priority tasks set out in all recent
strategic concepts?

  If Western European states are not ready to take the necessary
decisions in order to have armed forces at their disposal,
constituting a credible threat or deterrence to anyone
considering the use of armed force to obtain political
objectives, they will have to lower their voices and take a more
moderate stand in European and world security affairs than their
ambitions, as set out in the Maastrict Treaty, might suggest.

  They may still be able to defend their own territory, but they
will have to abandon the idea of wielding influence in those
parts of Europe where violence and the aggressive use of force
are still considered to be part of a nation's legitimate
instruments of action.

  At the same time, and irrespective of their views on the use
of armed forces, Western European nations must pay far more
attention to the stabilisation of newly-democratic European
states.  Democratic elections and the establishment of a free-
market economy are not enough.  The stability of a state also
depends on the existence of democratically-organised political
parties, trade unions, employers' federations and the rich
pattern of various organisations and associations constituting
the system of checks and balances which is essential for the
survival of modern Western democracies.  This complicated system
can be developed only gradually, but in the long run it is the
best guarantee of protection against extremism, nationalist
adventures and chaos.



IX.  What about peace-making?
     ------------------------


  If proper peace-keeping operations are causing so much
discussion and hesitation, what then are the prospects for
peace-making?  Almost from the start of the armed conflict in
former Yugoslavia, there has been an on-going debate over the
question whether there was a need for peace-making, which has
been defined as "armed intervention in a state, even against the
wishes of the government of that state, to prevent widespread
death or suffering amongst the population".

  In theory, the United Nations Charter provides for armed
intervention if "all appropriate diplomatic and other peaceful
means have failed".  Quite clearly, such armed intervention can
be authorised only by the international authority with the right
to do so, the United Nations Security Council.  Any armed
intervention aimed at peace-making, however, must meet a number
of conditions.

  First, there must be a political objective.  This can range
from the objective to stop the killing or ethnic cleansing to
the restoration of pre-existing borders or even democratic
institutions.  It should be noticed that armed intervention
cannot be terminated before the political objective has been
achieved.

  Political objectives, therefore, must be well-defined and
specific so that there can be no misunderstanding over the
question of when and whether the objective has been achieved.

  As a consequence, vaguely-defined reasons for armed
intervention, which have been put forward during the conflict in
former Yugoslavia, such as "to put pressure" on one or more
parties in the conflict, or "to show the resolve of the
governments" are fundamentally wrong.

  It should be added that in this conflict the EC has shown an
embarrassing lack of strategic political objectives.
Humanitarian intervention to stop the killing is relatively
useless if no satisfactory solutions can be offered for the
fundamental problems of self-determination, minority rights and
the changing of borders.  On these, sometimes conflicting,
issues the EC apparently has not yet made up its mind.

  Second, there must be a reasonable prospect of success.  Here,
political leaders will have to rely upon the advice of the
military, who must be able to tell them what troops and
equipment are required for the military operation to be
successful.  Their advice must include estimates of collateral
civilian casualties, collateral damage of civilian installations
and of casualties among their own troops.  The inevitable
question must be addressed: whether the political constituency
is prepared to sustain the possible considerable loss of human
lives and the financial consequences.

  Third, the intervention must do more good or avert more evil
than the damage wrought in the process of intervening.

  Finally, the interest at stake must be sufficiently important
to justify armed intervention with all its possible
consequences.  This is a crucial question.  Notwithstanding
public outcry, moral indignation in itself does not seem to be a
sufficiently sound reason for peace-making.

  Altogether, it will not be easy to imagine any peace-making
operation which meets this concise list of conditions.  Recent
experience in Somalia and Haiti can but confirm this view.

  The United Nations Secretary General, presenting his own
conclusions at a meeting of the United Nations Security Council,
said that he does not believe the United Nations to be capable
at present of peace-enforcement operations.  The United Nations
role, he said, was to maintain, not to impose, peace. (36)

Letters from H.E. Mr. Dimitris Macris, Greek Ambassador
to France, to Sir Dudley Smith, President of the WEU Assembly,
and information on Greece's position regarding
United Nations Security Council sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro
                              -------


Letters from Mr. Macris, Greek Ambassador to France,
to Sir Dudley Smith, President of the Assembly



                Paris, 14th July 1993


Dear President,

    Further to our conversation today, I enclose information on
Greece's position regarding the United Nations Security Council
sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro.

    I also enclose an annex to this memorandum relating to penal
procedures engaged against ships under Greek flag or belonging
to Greeks accused of having broken the embargo as well as
foreign vessels which have been monitored by the appropriate
Greek authorities.

    I take this opportunity to draw your attention to the
efforts of the Greek Government in its unswerving policy towards
respect of the embargo and special cases of violation of the
embargo and the sanctions taken.

                Yours sincerely,




                Dimitris MACRIS
                   Ambassador


Sir Dudley SMITH
President of the WEU Assembly




Paris, 20th July 1993



......

    Further to my letter of 14th July 1993 and apart from the
matters already mentioned, I wish to call your attention to the
fact that, in the meantime, two further cases have been referred
to the Piraeus Court:  those of the ships M/S Khrustanly, flying
the Ukrainian flag and chartered by a Dutch company, and
M/S Cloud, belonging to Maltese interests and flying the Maltese
flag.   They were stopped and searched in Italy and Croatia
respectively.   In both cases, the aim of the inquiry is to
determine whether or not those involved were individual or legal
entities subject to Greek jurisdiction.

    Furthermore, seven lorry drivers were recently taken to
court for having attempted to break the embargo:  one of these
cases was reported by United Nations observers in the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, another by the German
authorities and five by the Greek customs.   Finally, the most
important fact is that Greece has accepted the proposal by the
sanctions co-ordinator to introduce a system of pre-shipment
verification of the end destination of cargoes of oil and oil
derivatives.   This system has been in force since yesterday.
For cargoes in transit whose destination is the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, the only action will be to notify the SAM
post in Skopje so that it may carry out verifications on the
spot.   Appropriate arrangements have already been made to
ensure the maximum effectiveness of this measure.   Inter alia,
the number of entry points between Greece and the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been reduced from four to
two.

                ......


              Dimitris MACRIS
                Ambassador




Sir Dudley SMITH,
President of the WEU Assembly



Greece and United Nations sanctions
against Serbia and Montenegro


    In a series of recently-published articles in the
international press, Greece has again been accused of violating
the embargo imposed on Serbia and Montenegro.   It is therefore
essential to examine the facts more closely.

A.    The facts

    Since 1st June 1992, Greece has complied with United Nations
Security Council Resolution 752 of 30th May 1992.   In the
framework of measures aimed at restoring peace in the region,
this resolution imposed a series of sanctions on Serbia and
Montenegro.

    Almost immediately, articles appeared in the international
press describing Greece as the weak link in the operation and
affirming that it was violating the embargo in order, on the one
hand, to minimise its financial losses due to a decline in trade
and, on the other hand, to reduce political damage to
traditional Greek-Serb friendship.

    This is untrue.   On many occasions, Prime Minister
Constantin Mitsotakis asked in his speeches what proof there was
for these affirmations levelled at the Greek Government.
Nevertheless, in order to meet such defamatory allegations, the
Greek Government decided, on 21st August 1992, to stop all
exports of oil products across its northern frontier with former
Yugoslavia.   At the time, but not for long, this decision was
very well received by the international press and Greece's
European partners.

    Indirectly, proof of the effectiveness of this decision was
given by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs of the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Mr. Denko Maleski, who, in a
letter addressed to the United Nations, the EEC and other
international organisations, asked that measures be taken to
lift the oil embargo on his country immediately.   As from
22nd September 1992, Greece therefore decided to accept the
application of EEC ad hoc regulation 2656/92 temporarily lifting
the oil embargo.

    This led to a further wave of accusations that the embargo
was being violated.   This time, however, Greece was seen to be
guilty ... of conforming with EEC decisions!   In a recent
declaration (24th June 1993), the Greek Government spokesman,
Mr. Vassilis Magginas, stressed that:  "Those who criticise us
cannot claim to be right in both ways.   The Greek Government
has scrupulously applied the sanctions imposed on Serbia.   In
all the cases reported by observers, the goods transported came
from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  It may
therefore be wondered what our country should do.   If we do not
let the oil through, we are accused of being cruel to that
republic.   If we do let it through, we are accused of
complicity with the Serbs.   In other words, when we apply the
embargo on the former Yugoslav Repubic of Macedonia - the only
country of former Yugoslavia with which we have a common
frontier - we are accused of smothering it because we do not
like the name it has chosen, and if we give in we become guilty
of pro-Serb activities."


B.    Recent affirmations

    The important legislative and administrative measures taken
by Greece in conformity with United Nations Security Council
Resolutions 757/92, 787/92 and 820/93 were all and in detail
made available to the sanctions liaison group at its meeting in
Vienna on 4th June 1993.   These measures were presented in the
form of answers to a questionnaire sent to all member states of
the CSCE by Ambassador Napolitano, the sanctions co-ordinator.
It is interesting to underline the fact that only five countries
- including Greece - answered his request for information before
4th June 1993.   The Greek answer quotes, inter alia, Law
92/1967 setting out the penalties for violating presidential
decrees on the application of Security Council resolutions.

    In order to be able to apply the resolutions imposing the
confiscation of means of transport and goods, the Greek
Parliament has just passed an amendment to the abovementioned
Law 92/1967 making it possible to seize and confiscate such
means of transport and goods (Law 2145/93, Official Journal
A/88/28.5.93).

    Penal procedure has already been started against persons
violating the sanctions.   Ships flying the Greek flag or
belonging to Greeks have been searched and, where appropriate,
legal proceedings have been initiated (cf. appendix).

    In accordance with United Nations Security Council
Resolution 820/93, penalties have been increased and texts
adopted (Law 2145/93) allowing the confiscation of goods and
their means of transport.   Lorry drivers have been accused of
violating the embargo:

    -  a driver whose action was reported by United Nations
observers stationed in the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia;

    -  a driver who was denounced by the German authorities;

    -  five lorry drivers from the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia who were transporting Serb goods and were denounced by
the customs authorities in Thessalonica.

    Serb bank accounts were frozen after a series of circulars
had been sent to the relevant financial authorities and in
agreement with United Nations resolutions banning all financial
transactions with the Yugoslav Federation.

C.    An example of libel

    On 9th June 1993 and the following days, the Danish press
accused the Greek firm Econ Optics Mechanics of selling gun
sights to the belligerents in former Yugoslavia.   The sole
basis for these accusations was affirmations by Danish
businessmen who had visited the firm's premises in Greece.   The
firm rejected these accusations and sued the Danish paper Judske
Vestkysten.

    The relevant authorities at the Greek Ministry for Foreign
Affairs called for an inquiry to held immediately.   For the
time being, no proof has been found of any export whatsoever of
products by this firm to Balkan countries.   According to the
same Danish paper, the European Commissioner, Mr. Milan, has
refused to give this firm any financial assistance.   These
statements have not been corroborated.
