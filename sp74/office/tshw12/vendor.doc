                            -------------------
               pcx images sequencer for demos/presentations

                    (for DOS- or Windows-based systems)

                                   v1.2a

Trade::Show(tm) is a simple-to-use application that allows individuals or
organizations to quickly create slideshow programs for product or services
demos or other presentations.  It takes a sequence of user-prepared .pcx
image files in 640x480x16 VGA format and displays that sequence to customers,
clients, or other end-users in a choice of three methods:  at the end-user's
own pace with a key click to advance images, or with a self-running
continuous demo, or as a variant on the first that waits a few seconds for a
key click, and if not found, advances automatically.  All three methods are
included in the package.

Trade::Show(tm) is particularly effective for software developers preparing
demo versions of their products, in that they can easily capture actual
screen shots with programs like Hijaak(tm) for Windows and modify them in
editing programs such as Windows(tm) Paintbrush.

The capacity of the unregistered copy version is a sequence of up to and
including twenty (20) pcx images per demo/presentation.  The registered
copy provides a capacity for forty (40) images in a single sequence.
Versions with capacities greater than forty are available on order.

The full registration fee is only $39.95 (single-user system).
