  ----------------
  pcx images sequencer for demos/presentations
  (for DOS- or Windows-based systems)

  v1.2a


  Trade::Show should be installed on a hard drive.  For tolerable
  viewing results, do not run the program on a floppy drive.

  To install, type:

                 A:INSTALL <Enter>     or     B:INSTALL <Enter>

  There must be about 530k of free space available on the target hard drive
  or the install process will be incomplete, with indication of an error
  and an exit to DOS.  After installation, the program uses about 470k of
  space.  The install process will create a directory on the destination
  drive, the default selection being  \TRADESHW.  The install process does
  NOT modify your path, autoexec.bat, or config.sys.


  The primary files included on the installation disk of this package are:

           README.TXT (this file)
           INSTALL.EXE
           DEMO.EXE
           DEMO2.EXE
           DEMO3.EXE
           _SAMPLES.EXE  (self-extracting file)
           TRADESHW.TXT


┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ The following paragraph relates *ONLY* to bulletin board downloads:        │
│   If this program has been downloaded from a BBS, the files may be moved   │
│   to a diskette from which INSTALL.EXE is to be used, as indicated above.  │
│   You may also run INSTALL.EXE from your downloads directory *IF* you are  │
│   installing to a *DIFFERENT* logical drive from the one in which          │
│   INSTALL.EXE exists.                                                      │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  For an alternative installation, copy all essential files to a directory
  on your hard drive and then execute the self-extracting file _SAMPLES.EXE
  in that directory.  _SAMPLES.EXE may then be deleted from the directory.
  Use of INSTALL.EXE provides verification along with installation and
  provides opportunity to print the documentation (about 11 pages).


  After a new installation, the following files must be present in the
  \TRADESHW directory for a complete installation:

               DEMO.EXE
               DEMO2.EXE
               DEMO3.EXE
               DEMO1.PCX
               DEMO2.PCX
               DEMO3.PCX
               DEMO4.PCX
               DEMO5.PCX
               DEMO6_.PCX
               DEMO7_.PCX
               DEMO8_.PCX
               DEMO9_.PCX
