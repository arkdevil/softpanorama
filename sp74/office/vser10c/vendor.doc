Visible::Serialization(tm)
--------------------------
developers' serialization utilities


append a serial number (or other identifier) to an .exe


v1.0c


Visible::Serialization(tm) is a utilities set primarily intended for
software developers so that they may append a serial number (or other
identifier) to the end of an .exe file, create and/or increment such serial
numbers, and search for and display a serial number appended to an executable
file.  Users other than developers may use Visible::Serialization to
initialize purchased software applications with ownership, security-related,
or other identifying marks.

A unique serial number going out with each copy of an application affords
the developer with a possible opportunity to identify, if need be, the
registered client of a particular copy.  The end-user is normally unaware
of the existence of such a mark, its location, its method of placement or
the method of reading/verifying.  Its absence or modification may provide
evidence of tampering.

Visible::Serialization may be used with most traditional MS-DOS or Windows
executables, including those created with CA-Clipper, Borland Turbo Pascal,
QuickBASIC, PowerBasic, Visual Basic(tm) for Windows or DOS, FoxPro, Clarion,
C, Visual C++, etc.

Comprehensive documentation is included.  The full registration fee is only
$19.95.



Program Requirements
---------------------
The requirements for running Visible::Serialization include a DOS-compatible
PC with 512k memory.  DOS 3.1 (or later) or Windows 3.x (or later) should be
utilized.
