Here's a list of some of my freeware programs, in no particular order:

CAL-Calendar
------------
Displays 6 or 12 (VGA/50-line mode) months at a time.  Navigate using
keyboard or mouse.  Reminder for annually recurring or important unique
events.  Preset to highlight several holidays and a few other events, but
user-configurable to flexibly highlight other annually recurring or
one-time-only events instead.  Event definitions are kept in the common .DBF
format, so the user must have access to a program able to edit this format,
if customization is desired.

RV-RView
--------
Customizable archive lister & utility.  Currently supported are ARC, ARJ,
HYP, LZH, LZS, PAK, SQZ, ZIP & ZOO.  Displays ZIP- or LZH-style compression
ratios.  Various sort options.  Converts self-extracting archives back to
normal.  Misc. other features.

RVS-RView Shell
---------------
Shell for viewing and extracting the contents of several archive types.
Calls on user-selectable external programs to extract and view.  Currently
supported are ARC, ARJ, HYP, LZH, LZS, PAK, SQZ, ZIP and ZOO.  Displays
either ZIP- or LZH-style compression ratios.  Various sort options.

DBV-DBF View
------------
Simple viewer/editor for dBASE-compatible .DBF files.  Switch between record
and browse modes.  Does single-field, scan-across searches.  Editing of
fields enabled by command-line switch.  May be used to search a directory
for .DBF files regardless of filename extension (/F2).

FIX-File Fix
------------
Binary editor, with record orientation, which allows searches for either
text or hex strings.  Default record size automatically set to maximum
allowed by number of lines on screen.  (Maximum record size is 576 bytes
with a 50-line screen.)  The program draws from a common library of routines
shared with other programs I've written.  Color or black-and-white mode
automatically determined at program start-up.

CRC-Cyclic Redundancy Checker
-----------------------------
Displays 16- and 32-bit CRC's of files or directory contents.  16-bit CRC   
same as for ARC, LZH, LZS, PAK and ZOO files.  32-bit CRC same as for ARJ   
and ZIP.  "CRC filespec" displays individual CRC's for the specified        
file(s).  "CRC path" displays accumulated CRC's of all files contained in   
the specified directory.  May be used to compare files/directories on       
physically separated machines, or to see if changes have occurred over time.

DirX-Directory of eXecutables
-----------------------------
Shell for detecting files compressed by several executable file compressors.
Calls on user-selectable external programs to transparently compress and
uncompress files from within the program.  Currently supported are AXE,
DIET, EXEPACK, ICE, LEXEM, LZEXE, PKLITE, SCRNCH, SHRINK and TINYPROG.

DirXC-DirX Command-line lister
------------------------------
Smaller, simpler version of DirX for when you just want a listing of
compressed and uncompressed files.  Listing is redirectable to printer or
file.  Mimicks DOS's DIR command, to an extent.  No sorting is performed.

HOL-Holiday
-----------
Command-line utility for listing selected U.S. holidays falling within a
range of dates.  You may specify a starting year or date.  By default, lists
all holidays for the year starting from your system date.  Switches are
available to:  show Easter and Ash Wednesday only, show Federal (Postal)
holidays only, and to modify the range of dates searched.  A pause option is
also included.

ZFV-ZIP Format View
-------------------
Allows you to see how a ZIP file is laid out on disk.  Uses windowing to
step down to lower levels of detail.  Displays header offsets and most field
values, including their interpretation.  Admittedly, this program isn't for
everyone.  For the curious and those with a need to know, however, this
program displays technical data on ZIP files that I haven't seen in any
other program.

RVB-RView Batch
---------------
Here's a simple utility that does little more than return a unique
ERRORLEVEL code based on archive format.  Does a cursory check for invalid
archives.  Currently supported are ARC, ARJ, HYP, LZH, LZS, PAK, SQZ, ZIP &
ZOO.

RC-RCalc
--------
Non-TSR dec/hex/bin/oct expression calculator.  Also decimal floating-point.
Supports modulus (%) and exponentiation (^) in addition to the four basic
arithmetic operations.  Input window is editable and allow nested
parentheses and extra space characters.  Calculator can be repositioned on
screen.

Suggested BBS names for the above programs would be formed by taking the
first part of the title line above (e.g. "RV"), followed by the major (1
digit) and minor (2 digits) version numbers, without the dot.  Thus, RV 2.51
becomes RV251.  (The filename extension would be whatever archive format the
particular BBS requires, if any, though I usually upload my distribution
archives to CompuServe in .ZIP format.)

To search for currently available freeware on CompuServe, which I've
uploaded myself, search on the keyword "RTK".
