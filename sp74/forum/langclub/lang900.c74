Introduction:  This document is intended to become among the longest lists
of computer programming language names ever assembled or compiled.  (But
not interpreted!  HHOJ)  It is more for fun than to be any sort of
scholarly, definitive list.

As of this writing, about 50 netters have contributed to it.  Their names
and e-mail addresses appear at the end.  It is my dream that this can
become a living document with at least one definitive reference work
included for each entry.

Most entries should ultimately contain the following information:

Name:  An explanation of the language name, which, in perhaps 80% of the
cases, is some form of acronym or abbreviation.

Date of first implementation:  When possible, a year in parentheses
indicates when a language first appeared.  Since the design,
implementation, and wide acceptance of a language can take place over a
several year period, such dates should be considered approximate.

Definitive reference work or publisher:  At least one reference work on the
language, in theory as definitive or as official as possible, should be
included.  In the case of a commercial product, the software publisher and
city is often listed.  Few people who see a language in this file should
ever have to ask: "How can I get more information on that language?"

"See also:"  Related languages or terms that may also be of interest.


Some various comments or criticisms:

"YOU LEFT OUT LANGUAGE ___!" - If this is the case, e-mail the relevant
information to whoever is maintaining this list.  (It may not be me by the
time you read this.)  A citing of at least one published reference to the
language will help determine authenticity.

"Clutter" - When in doubt, languages are included.  To compensate for this
"clutter" effect, more widespread languages such as C or FORTRAN should
have longer entries.

The "Published" Rule - In order to reduce clutter somewhat, a language
should be "published" to be included in this list.  There is no precise
criterion here.  To state a rough example, a language devised solely for a
PhD thesis would not necessarily be included.  However, if material on that
language was published in a technical journal or otherwise distributed, or
if it formed the basis for additional research, it should be included.

In case it is unclear, a language does NOT have to be implemented (actually
running on at least one computer) to be included.  Many theoretical
languages appearing in the ACM SIGPLAN Notices fall into this category. 
One gray area, however, is Internet/Usenet or RBBS distribution.  In
general, when in doubt, an entry will be included.

(Future builders of this list may be able to include a wider range of
academic "theory" languages.  I do not have the research resources for
this.  At minimum the author's name, university or company, and date should
be listed.)

For historical completeness, roughly 200 early pre-1959 "automatic
programming systems" were included.  (Based on a list from CACM 2(5):16,
May 1959.)  It can be argued that many of these are not really "programming
languages" as the term is used today.

Languages vs. dialects - Again, when in doubt, a term was included.  Thus,
languages with many variants or flavors will have many extra entries.  This
is intended to make the document more useful to beginners, not to make
common languages appear more popular or "better."  (In defense of this
practice, any two implementations of a given language almost invariably
have at least a few differences.  Some have suggested that if there are
various command line arguments, each permutation of command line arguments
could also be considered a distinct language!  Note also that some names
("ML", "Vulcan") have been used for two or more distinct languages.

Languages vs. versions - There has been criticism that there are separate
entries for ALGOL 58, ALGOL 60, etc, but not for C++ 1.0, C++ 1.2, C++ 2.0,
etc.  This was simply an oversight on my part.  (I personally feel it is
easier to have separate entries for each, however.)  Any language that has
some sort of ANSI or IEEE standard should include the dates and versions
approved.  Also, for specific brands such as Turbo Pascal the versions and
release dates could be added within that entry.

Classification - This document makes no attempt at classification except by
name.  However, the following broad categories seem to apply:  assemblers,
general purpose languages, specialized languages, query languages, 4GL's,
application sub-languages, specification languages, experimental languages,
and theoretical languages.  The precise definitions of these categories can
be debated elsewhere.

Editorial Comments:  Warning - as in the many Usenet jargon files, some
entries here contain remarks that could be construed as editorial in
nature.  For instance, if one happened to called Pascal "ALGOL-like," it
might manage to offend both some ALGOL and some Pascal users.  Also, some
historical origin questions are disputed to this day.  This document is
intended to aid the student or researcher, not to ignite flame wars among
old-time hackers.  The reader is encouraged to refer to other sources for
more definitive discussions of any particular language.  When in doubt,
"supposedly" or a "(?)" may appear to warn that the material is uncertain. 
Phrasing like "somewhat" or "roughly" is also used liberally.

Brand names - Some entries, such as "Turbo Pascal" have drawn early
concern.  However, since many packages offer non-standard extensions to the
base language, it can be argued that from a BNF grammar point of view,
Microsoft C and Turbo C (for example) are two distinct languages.  On the
other hand, this is not intended to become a catalog of commercial
programming products.

Material in "[ ]" brackets clearly needs editorial work or research.

Ada - Named for Ada Lovelace, arguably the world's first computer
programmer.  Designed by Jean Ichbiah for the U.S. Department of Defense. 
Ada is a large, complex block-structured language.  Aimed primarily at
embedded computer applications, Ada has facilities for real-time response,
concurrency, hardware access, and reliable run-time error handling.  In
support of large-scale software engineering, it emphasizes strong typing,
data abstraction and encapsulation.  The type system uses name equivalence
and includes both subtypes and derived types.  Both fixed and floating
point numerical types are supported.
    Control flow is fully bracketed: if-then-elsif-end if, case-is-when-end
case, loop-exit-end loop, goto.  Subprogram parameters are in, out, or
inout.  Variables imported from other packages may be hidden or directly
visible.   Operators may be overloaded, and so may enumeration literals. 
There are user-defined exceptions and exception handlers.
    An Ada program consists of a set of packages encapsulating data objects
and their related operations.  A package has a separately compilable body
and interface.  Ada permits generic packages and subroutines, possibly
parametrized.
    Ada programming places a heavy emphasis on multitasking.  Tasks are
synchronized by the rendezvous, in which a task waits for one of its
subroutines to be executed by another.  The conditional entry makes it
possible for a task to test whether an entry is ready.  The selective wait
waits for either of two entries or waits for a limited time.

CLU - CLUster.  Late 70's.  CLU is an object-oriented language of the
Pascal family designed to support data abstraction, similar to Alphard. 
Introduced the iterator: a coroutine yielding the elements of a data
object, to be used as the sequence of values in a for loop.
    A CLU program consists of separately compilable procedures, clusters
and iterators, no nesting.  A cluster is a module naming an abstract type
and its operations, its internal representation and implementation. 
Clusters and iterators may have parameters.  Supplying actual constant
values for the parameters instantiates the module.
    There are no implicit type conversions.  In a cluster, the explicit
type conversions 'up' and 'down' change between the abstract type and the
representation.  There is a universal type 'any', and a procedure force[]
to check that an object is a certain type.  Objects may be mutable or
immutable.
    Exceptions are raised using 'signal' and handled with 'except'. 
Assignment is by sharing, similar to the sharing of data objects in LISP.
Arguments are passed by call-by-sharing, similar to call by value, except
that the arguments are objects and can be changed only if they are mutable. 
CLU has own variables and multiple assignment.

Icon - Griswold, 1970's.  A descendant of SNOBOL4 with Pascal-like syntax. 
Icon is a general-purpose language with special features for string
scanning.  Dynamic types.  The central theme of Icon is the generator: when
an expression is evaluated it may be suspended and later resumed, producing
a result sequence of values until it fails.  This resumption takes place
implicitly in two contexts: iteration which is syntactically like a loop
(every-do), and goal-directed evaluation in which a conditional expression
automatically attempts to produce at least one result.  Expressions that
fail are used in lieu of Booleans.  Data backtracking is supported by a
reversible assignment.  Icon also has co-expressions, which can be
explicitly resumed at any time.  "The Icon Programming Language", Ralph &

Systems", Comp Surveys 21(3):261-322 (Sep 1989).

language development, by an IBM language technology manager.  Almost 800
pages of meticulous detail.

Weinberg, Gerald "The Psychology of Computer Programming", 1971.

Wexelblat, R.L. ed, "Proceedings:  ACM SIGPLAN History of Programming
Languages Conference"  (Los Angeles, July 1978)  Perhaps the most
entertaining account of the history of roughly 15 major programming
languages.  310 pp.  Jean Sammet apparently co-ordinated the conference. 
Academic Press, 1981.  ACM Item No 548780.  ACM Order Dept is

Wilson, L.B. & Clark, R.G.  "Comparative Programming Languages", A-W 1988. 
ISBN: 0-201-18483-4.  Languages compared on a feature-by-feature (rather
than language-by-language) basis.


APPENDIX B

Selected Issues in Computer Language Design:
===========================================


A "core" versus "complete" language

Should a language provide a small, minimal core that is extensible (FORTH,
ALGOL, C) or should it try to have syntax for almost everything already
included?  (PL/I, Ada, dBASE IV)

How much structure should automatically be imposed?

Some languages, such as C, give a great latitude to the layout of
statements on the page.  Others, such as COBOL, are more verbose and
structured in an attempt to force "self-documenting code."

Features are added but never removed


APPENDIX C

A chronology of influential computer languages:
==============================================

(Note:  It has been suggested that K. Zuse in Nazi Germany may have had
first real computer programming language, "Plankalkul" ca. 1945.  This is
alluded to in the 1978 ACM History of Programming Languages FORTRAN
session.)

FORTRAN: 1957

ALGOL: 1958

LISP: 1960

COBOL: 1960

APL 1962

PL/I: 1964

BASIC: 1964

PROLOG: 1970

C: 1972

Pascal: 1975

Modula-2: 1979

Smalltalk: 1980

dBASE II: ca. 1980

Ada: 1983

C++: 1986

Eiffel: ?

Oberon: 1988


APPENDIX D

Who will gather some interesting rough statistics relating to computer
language usage?  Things such as:

[Nine (?) billion lines of COBOL code written?]

[75% of world's software spending by DOD?]

[80% of all paid programming maintenance programming?]

[ n million people have programmed in BASIC? ]
