/* readme  - this is the readme file of the MLEPM package    940525 */

MLEPM adds hooks, highlighting and various editing mode to EPM, in a way 
that makes it easy for users to incorporate into their own EPM setup.  It 
is a customized version of EPM that users who don't want to recompile the 
macros can use directly.

Enjoy!

Release notes
=============

      o  This package is in beta, so, please, be indulgent :), and send
         me all your comments at the following address:

            lafaix@sophia.inria.fr

      o  MLEPM has been tested with EPM v5.51a only, but it should work
         with v5.51 too.  Let me know if you have trouble with it...

      o  See MLEPM.ABS for a description of all included files.

      o  All documentation is in the *.e files.


Installation:
=============

      0. Unpack this package.

      1. copy all .ex files somewhere along your EPMPATH.

      1.bis  Start MPOPUP.EXE (and put it in your startup folder)

      2. load epm and edit the styles.smp file.  Customize the included
         styles, if needed.

         [This step IS important!]

      2.bis  enable the profile support, if not already done:

         Bring up the command dialog (Ctrl+I),
         Enter the following command:  PROFILE ON
         Save your options (Options/Save options)

      3. Merge profile.smp with your profile.erx (if you were not using
         a profile.erx, just rename profile.smp to profile.erx, and put
         it somewhere along your EPMPATH).

      4. Exit EPM, and restart it.  Try loading a new C file, and play
         with it...

      You're done!


Common troubles:
================

      No popmenus
      No on-the-fly highlighting...

         Is MPOPUP.EXE running ?  If not, then start it!  (It's YOUR
         responsability to start MPOPUP, so, if you're using MLEPM,
         puting a shadow of MPOPUP.EXE is highly recommended.)

         [If MPOPUP.EXE is running, there should be a MLPOPUP entry
          in the task-list.]
