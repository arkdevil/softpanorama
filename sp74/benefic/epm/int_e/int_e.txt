Program Description: Intelligent E, prevents the system editor from asking for a file type.
Operating System: OS/2 2.x, needs Rexx installed

Program Source: author (cawim@pool.informatik.rwth-aachen.de)

This is a small rexx script that blows some intelligence into the
system editor of OS/2. I always hated E for asking me to associate
a file type. This script takes care of the file type and prevents E
from asking anymore.
