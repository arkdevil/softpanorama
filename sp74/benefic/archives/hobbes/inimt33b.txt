Program Description: IniMaint v3.3b - display, manage and repair *.ini files
 
Operating System: OS/2 2.x

Program Source: author

******************************* V3.3b *******************************

The items fixed in Version 3.3b are:

1. The error recording in a couple of MultiMaint situations was improved.

2. The code that searches for the OS/2 Command Processor will use the COMSPEC 
Environment Variable rather than searching the CONFIG.SYS file.

3. An additional Option has been added to the Options dialog that will force 
the various Desktop Backup and Restore routines to use the value that is in 
the COMSPEC Environment Variable for the OS/2 Command Processor. If this 
Option is left in the default condition, which is Off, the the routines will 
first search for CMD.EXE. If CMD.EXE is found, it will be used. If CMD.EXE is 
not found, then the COMSPEC entry will be used, no matter what the setting of 
this Option.

4. The Install Program Message Box would exceed the size of a VGA screen, so 
it has been changed to a Dialog with a Listbox.

5. All of the Tools now have an Object ID and the Install program will not 
completely remake the individual tools each time Setup is run. If a Tool 
already exists, it will be left alone or updated based on a new Checkbox in 
the Install Defaults Dialog.

6. Three new Tools will now be created. The new Tools will display the 
Descriptions of the various types of Backups: Desktop, Supplemental and 
Portable.

7. The default value for the DOS_AUTOEXEC setting for DOS programs would 
always default to C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT, even if drive C was not the boot drive. 
The code has been changed to change the drive letter to the correct boot 
drive, rather than just use dirve C.

8. The Default for the DOS KBD_CTRL_BYPASS should be NONE, not CTRL_ESC and 
it has been changed.

9. In order to allow more room to display the Objects to be Restored in the 
Portable Restore Dialog a menu has been added to the Dialog in place of the 
various options that were displayed at the top of the dialog. This has 
allowed the window that holds the Objects to be expanded to nearly the size 
of the dialog window.

10. Zipstream Compressed Drives were not recognized correctly because 
Zipstream did not support DosOpen on the drive level. The code has been 
changed to use DosQueryFSAttach to look for drive types and to bypass the 
DosOpen when a valid HD drive type is found.

11. The PM_Workplace:PalettePos entry for the Warp Launch Pad was stored in a 
different manner than all other Objects store this information. This caused 
the Repair Code to treat the Launch Pad as an Invalid Object. The code has 
been changed so it will not handle data stored in both the old and the new 
format.

12. The Main Menu Bar was getting crowded, so it has been reorganzied by 
taking the Options, Groups and Size items and putting them into a new 
Miscellaneous Menu. The Desktop Menu was also too long, so a new Menu, WPS, 
has been added and the MultiMaint stuff has been moved from the Desktop Menu 
to the WPS Menu. The sequence of the Menu items on the Desktop and WPS Menus 
has also been modified to make it easier to use.

13. A new item has been added to the WPS menu that will list all of the 
Registered WPS Classes and this item has also been added to the Tools Folder. 
This menu item will display all of the Registered WPS Classes and has the 
capability to Deregister any of the Classes.

14. If certain kinds of Objects that were derieved from WPTransient existed 
on the Desktop when a Portable Backup was attempted a Logic Error 1709 would 
result because these Objects did not support some of the Data Collection 
Methods. Additional code has been added to handle these Objects by simply 
bypassing them as soon as sufficient information is collected to verify that 
they are derived from WPTransient.

15. Virtual drives defined as part of the Toronto Virtual File System had the 
same problem as the Zipstream Drives, so a check for these drives was added 
in the same place.

16. The Icons for the Tools Folder were updated to be more meaningful. 
Although it is hard to always convey the purpose of a Tool with an Icon, an 
effort was made to make them as meaningful as possible.

17. The Install program would not accept a lower case letter as the drive 
letter. The problem has been fixed.
