This is a beta release of PC Yarn, a suite of programs used to store
and read USENET news and mail offline.

Changes:

- The newgroup program adds new newsgroups to the user's newsrc file.

- Fix: The reader violated the "Good Net Keeping Seal" by not requiring a
  Subject for posts.

- Fix: The OS/2 version of the import program incorrectly calculated the
  available disk space.

- Fix: Saving to the printer device with the OS/2 version resulted in a
  write error.
