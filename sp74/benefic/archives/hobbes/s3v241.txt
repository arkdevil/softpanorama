     Installation Instructions
     S3 OS/2 Driver version 2.4x (For OS/2 2.1, 2.11, and 3.0 for Windows)
                                                          
     Date:      08/07/94
     
     Installation Considerations
     
     1.  The installation process assumes that the user knows the  
         maximum vertical refresh rate as well as the maximum   
         resolution of the monitor.
     
     2.  When installing the S3 driver over a non-S3 driver 
         (e.g., SVGA), the standard IBM VGA driver must be      
         installed first.  This is not required if an S3 driver   
         is already installed.
     
     3.  The driver diskettes must be labeled "S3 DRV1"(disk 1) and 
         "S3 DRV2" (disk 2).  If it is not labeled installation will fail.
     
     4.  The S3 driver will not install unless an S3 chip-based 
         card is installed in the machine at the time of driver      
         installation. 
     
     
     Installation Instructions
     
     
     1.  Make sure you have all open data files saved before 
         continuing the S3 driver installation.
     
     2.  Make sure Win-OS/2 session and all Seamless Windows 
         applications are closed. (Seamless applications are 
         windows applications that run on top of the PM Desktop.)
     
     3.  Open an OS/2 command prompt (windowed or full screen).
     
     4.  Insert driver diskette into the floppy drive. 
     
     5.  Change to the floppy drive (A: or B:) into which you have 
         inserted driver disk #1.  Verify that the diskette 
         is labeled "S3 DRV1" (do the same for disk #2).  If it is not      
         labeled then type "label S3 DRV1" or "label S3 DRV2".
     
     6.  Type S3INST A: C: and press "Enter".  ("A" is the floppy 
         drive; "C" is the drive OS/2 is installed).
     
         Note: You may see an error message stating could not locate files. 
         Please ignore this message.
     
     7.  When prompted, insert Disk #2.  It must be label "S3 DRV2".
     
     8.  When prompted, exit the OS/2 command prompt, remove floppy
         disk from drive, and shutdown and reboot system.
     
     
     9.  When OS/2 is up insert disk 1 (S3 DRV1) into the floppy   
         drive.
     
     10. Double click on the the "OS/2 System" icon.
     
     11. Double click on the "System Setup" icon.
     
     12. Double click on the "Display Driver Install" icon. 
     
     13. When prompted by the Display Driver Install dialog, select
         Primary Display and then click the OK button.
     
     14. Select the "32 Bit S3 Display Drivers" option from the 
         Primary Display Adapter Type dialog and click the OK 
         button.
     
     15. Select the appropriate option from the Monitor 
         Configuration/Selection Utility dialog, and click the 
         OK button.  Select "Default" if it is an S3 BIOS that was not      
         modified by the OEM.
     
         THE SCREEN WILL TEMPORARILY FLASH AND GO BLACK.  PLEASE 
         WAIT FOR THE SOURCE DIRECTORY DIALOG TO APPEAR.
     
     16. The Source Directory dialog will be displayed.  Set the source     
         directory to the location of disk 1 (S3 DRV1).  Double click 
         on the "Install" button.
     
         17. Insert disk 2 (S3 DRV2) into the floppy drive when prompted.
     
     18. The Installation Program may pause and display prompts to 
         overwrite certain files.  Please answer YES for each file.
     
     19. You will be given a message stating that you "Must 
         Shutdown and Restart your system for the changes to take 
         effect".  Click the OK button.
     
     20. Remove driver diskette from the floppy drive.  
     
     21. Shut down and reboot system.  
     
        Note:  You can double click the "System" Icon in the System Setup  
        to change resolution before shutting down.
     
        After you reboot your system will come up with your newly 
        installed driver.
     
     To Change Resolution:
     
     22. To switch resolutions, double click on the "System" icon  
         in the System Setup Folder.
