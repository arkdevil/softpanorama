Description :  Gnuplot 3.5, with gnufit12, div_hack, and enhpost patches.
               Binaries and patches only, compiled for OS/2 using EMX 09a2.

               Gnuplot 3.5 distribution source is not included, but may be
               obtained from gnuplt35.zip in the same directory.
               
               The following patches are included in the archive :
               - gnufit12 (by Carsten Grammes)
                 nonlinear least squares curve fitting for data from file.
               - div_hack (by David Denholm)
                 column arithmetic expressions for data from file.
               - enhpost  (by Matt Heffron, David Denholm, Russel Lang)
                 enhanced postscript terminal, allowing multiple fonts,
                 sub/superscripts, etc.
                 'call' and 'if' commands added for gnuplot scripts.

               Note : all of these patches are based on the 3.5 distribution
               source.  Applying them sequentially requires some hand edits,
               since Gnu Patch can no longer locate the context for diffs in
               the third patch, after the first two have been applied.

               For a description of the new functionality, enter the
               following commands in gnuplot :
                  
                  help call
                  help if
                  help set term enhpost

                  help fit
                  help update

               The column arithmetic expressions are not documented in the
               online help file.  The following examples should suffice :

                  plot "datafile" using 1:(sin($2*$3))
                  plot "datafile" using ($2*$3-1):(3+acos($1/$2))

               The token following 'using' is parsed into subtokens in the
               usual way (delimited by ':').  If any of these are enclosed
               in parentheses, then they will be treated as expressions, in
               which any $i refers to datafile column i.
               Note : this syntax does not apply to the fit command !!!
