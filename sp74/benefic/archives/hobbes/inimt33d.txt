******************************* V3.3c *******************************

The items fixed in Version 3.3c are:

1. Up to now it has only been possible to Drag file to any of the 
applications if the application was not running. If this was done, then the 
app: IniMaint, SysMaint or MultiMaint, would start with that file. Additional 
code has been added so that you can now drag a file to any of the 
applications while they are running and they will make the dragged file the 
current file.

2. The Install program would erase the unneeded files even if nothing was 
done during the Install. An additional check has been added so that the files 
will never be erased unless there has been a successful run of the Install 
thread.

3. An additional item has been added to the Install Instructions that 
discusses which of the applications the user needs to install or setup.

4. The Install program assumed the OS/2 Command Processor would be CMD.EXE, 
but this is not the case in situations where users are running an alternative 
Command Processor. Additional code has been added to use the file specified 
in the COMSPEC entry in the Environment as the Command Processor.

5. If a new version was installed over a previous version and the new install 
was an upgraded Application, MultiMaint over IniMaint, for example, the old 
EXE file was not erased and it was possible for the old EXE file to be 
specified as the EXE file in all of the Tools. Additional code has been added 
to erase any old copies before the new one is copied over so that this 
problem will not occur.

6. A fully user configurable Toolbar has been added.

7. Install did not have a provision for copying the Help file to a directory 
other than the install directory. An addition item has been added to the 
defaults Dialog so that a different install directory can be specified.

8. The drive for the DLL Directory in the Install was always drive C:, even 
though a different drive was used to boot. Additional code has been added to 
change this drive to the boot drive.

9. The Install program did not exclude Install.EXE when unzipping the files. 
This could cause the unzip to terminate without doing everything. The unzip 
has been changed so that it will never include the Install.EXE as one of the 
files to be unzipped.

10. If the user leaves the unzip checkbox checked while doing an Install and 
the files to be unzipped are INIDOC and INIEXE or MLTDOC and MLTEXE, the user 
will be aske dot confirm that they want the unzip done. The reason for this 
is that the user had to unzip the XXXEXE.ZIP file in order to get the Install 
program, so it is very likely that the unzip is not needed.

11. When the Install program finished the Install or Setup, the user was not 
clearly informed as to whether the Install was successful or not and was not 
told what ot do next. The code has been changed so that the user will now get 
a Message Box informing them if the Install was successful and tellling them 
what to do next in either case.

12. The Install program will now check to see if there is a Safe Version of 
the appropriate Application in the directory where the Application was 
installed and, if it is there, it will create a Safe Tool in the Tools 
Folder.

13. The selection of Test for Non Write INI Files would always terminate the 
application after it was used. This was caused by the fact that the Tools 
Termination Flag was set even if the current execution was not a Tools 
execution. An additional check has been added so that the Tools Termination 
Flag will only be set when the execution is a Tools one.

14. The IniMaint Repair would not Repair File Handles on Network Drives if 
the return from the Query Path API was Invalid Password. This error has been 
added to the set of errors that will cause a Drive, Directory or File to not 
be accessable, therefore, it will not longer abend the Repair.

15. It was possible for the Desktop Backup to not work when run from the 
Tools Icon if the Desktop Backup Descriptions were not turned on. This was 
caused by the fact that the parent process would terminate before the child 
process was finished and the termination of the parent process would cause 
the child process to be terminated by OS/2.

******************************* V3.3d *******************************

The items fixed in Version 3.3d are:

1. There wer still some situations where Install would have a problem 
creating Objects, so this part of the code was further modified to make it 
more robust.

2. When a Toolbar Icon was dragged over one of the data windows, OS/2 would 
get locked. The problem was caused by the normal Drag and Drop code not 
handling this condition correctly and has been fixed.

3. If an error occurred during a Drag and Drop operation, the Dump Dialog 
would correctly report the error, however, the application would not 
terminate, even if the Cancel option was selected. This was caused by the 
unique way that the return must be handled for Drag and Drop. Additional code 
has been added to insure that the application will terminate under these 
conditions.

4. If an attempt was made to make a Desktop Backup and a previous Backup was 
terminated early for some reason, it was possible that there would be some 
temporary files left from the unsuccessful Backup attempt. It was possible  
for these files to cause a problem with a subsequent Desktop Backup, so 
additional code has been added to the Desktop Backup CMD File to insure that 
the files are erased before the Desktop Backup is started.

5. There were situations where the user would be asked if they wanted to 
Repair a Network Drive entry even though they are being ignored or just 
Reported. This occurred in situations where the drive was in the form 
\\DRIVENAME and was caused by the fact that one place in the code was not 
recognizing this as a drive level entry. The code in this one area has been 
updated so this it will recognize this type of drive entry and the user will 
no longer be asked about this item.

6. If Help was requested for either of the Delete User CMD File entries in 
the Desktop Defaults Dialog, the general Help for the Dialog was displayed 
and there was no discussion of what these two entries did and why they were 
required for the User CMD Files and not the others. Help for these two 
entries has now been added.

7. There was no Help for the Always use COMSPEC Checkbox in the Options 
Dialog. The Help has not been written.

8. The Toolbar Help has been added with the Version.

9. The Move Icon on the Toolbar actually invoked the Compare Function. This 
has been fixed so that Move will work correctly.

10. I an attempt was made to do a Desktop Backup and there was no SET PATH 
entry in the CONFIG.SYS file, the routine that builds the Backup CMD File 
would get an error and the Backup would terminate. Additional code has been 
added to handle this problem and the Backup will still work as long as the 
appropriate EXE files can be found.

11. There were a number of references in the Help to the MLE, which is the 
window that contains the Key Value Information. There was no explanation of 
what an MLE was and this would be confusing to a user who is not familiar 
with this term. All references to the MLE have been changed to Key Value 
Window, so that all users will understand what is being referenced.

12. The Help File description of the Key Value Window did not say anything 
about the format of the information in the Window nor did it mention that a 
Key Value can be modified ditectly be overtyping the information in this 
Window. This information has now been added to the Help File.

13. The ShifRun program was mentioned in a number of places in the Help, but 
the explanation was only available in a single location. The explanation was 
also a very brief one. ShiftRun has now been added to IniCopy and IniClean as 
separate programs and a separate and more detailed explanation has been 
included.

14. Changing the Classes to be Included and Excluded in the WPS Settings 
Dialog was difficult if the user wanted to Include or Exclude more than one. 
The reason was that the Exclude and Include was done via a menu and only one 
could be done at a time. The Exclude, Include and Reset Exclude/Include for 
the Settings Dialog has been changed to use a Dialog with a Listbox making it 
much easier to visualize what is Included and Excluded and making it easy to 
Exclude, Include or Reset multiple entries at one time.
