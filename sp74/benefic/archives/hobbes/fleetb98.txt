                          ==================

(* = fixed bug, + = new feature, # = change, - = eliminated)

# Made SHIFT-F9 usable for editing object titles (workaround for OS/2 bug).
# CTRL-T does no longer cause a refresh of the thread list. Use the function
  in the popup menu of the thread list instead.
* Tried to match addresses in Echomail
* Node numbers like "x:y/0" were not accepted from Squish.Cfg.
+ Random Origin lines.
+ New Rexx variables "FleetMsg.Kludges" and "FleetMsg.Seenbys".
* Traps when deleting carbon copy lists, scripts or templates using the
  shredder (under Warp 3.0).
* Traps when renumbering a *.MSG style area.
# Changes made for Warp 3.0
