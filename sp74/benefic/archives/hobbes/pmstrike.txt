General description:


   PMSTRIKE  is a programm to make any application  visible  or  in-
   visible  in the Windowlist.  Furthermore  you can also  determine
   whether  an  application can be reached by pressing  [ALT]+[ESC].

   This is especially useful when you run a lot of background tasks.
   Normally,  OS/2 will list most of these  programms in the  window
   list  making it hard  to find the right entry.  The same is  true
   when cycling through sessions with [ALT]+[ESC].
