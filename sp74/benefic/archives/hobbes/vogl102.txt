    VOGL PM 1.02 (5/19/94)
    A VOGL driver for OS/2 Presentation Manager

    VOGL is a library of C routines which try to allow a programmer to write
    programs which can be moved to machines which have the Silicon Graphics GL 
    library on them.  It is based entirely on the VOGLE graphics library, and 
    as a result can handle circles, curves, arcs, patches, and polygons in a 
    device independent fashion.  Simple hidden line removal is also available 
    via polygon backfacing.  Access to hardware text and double buffering of 
    drawings depends on the driver. 

    The compiled examples, voglpm.dll, hershey.dll, and the Hershey fonts are 
    included in this archive in examples.zip.  (NOTE: the emx dlls are 
    required for the examples.)

    This archive DOES NOT contain everything needed to recompile the VOGL 
    library.  The VOGL documentation and the rest of the source code needed 
    to compile the library is available from gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au in
    /pub/vogl.tar.gz.  This driver may be incorporated into future versions
    of the VOGL archive.

    Makefiles for emx/gcc are included in this archive.
