This Rexx file will allow you to dial into the University of Missouri 
Rolla's campus server.. You mut modify the script with your own login 
name and password.  After you execute the command, you are required to 
open an OS/2 window, go to the tcpip\bin directory and type the following:
bootp sl0

This will initialize the protocol and you should be ready to go..

If you have any questions you can email me at either akapa@umr.edu
