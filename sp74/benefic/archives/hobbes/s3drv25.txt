This is version 2.5 of the 32 bit S3 drivers along with some installation
instructions that I wrote.  I have nothing to do with S3 or IBM.  I am
just an S3 owner who had been frustrated for 3 weeks.  These files were
downloaded from Jaton Corporation's BBS (408-263-8529).

The drivers will work with the JAX8241.  I cannot vouch for any others,
but give them a try.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me.
