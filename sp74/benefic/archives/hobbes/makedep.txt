MAKEDEP is a small dependency file creator, something I missed since I migrated 
to DOS + OS/2, so I had to write it myself.
Its function is simple: It searches all available .c and .cpp files for lines 
containing a #include statement. It then dumps the include files to a file
called depends.lst. This can be included in the makefile for an easy rebuilding
process.

  usage:  MAKEDEP [-o depfile]
  while depfile is an alternate dependency file

NO WARRANTY whatsoever is offered for MAKEDEP.
