10 lines description:
INISED is a command line utility (OS/2 and DOS versions included)
that can read and write values to/from Windows-style profile
files (INI files). It is intended to automate the reconfiguring
of programs without the need to maintain multiple versions on INI
files. INISED can manipulate files based on command line paramters,
or can read a sequence of commands from a script file.
