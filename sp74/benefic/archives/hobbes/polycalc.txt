PolyCalc Version 1.01            A Workplace Shell Engineering Calculator

Written by Mike Thompson of Graduate Software, PolyCalc is a full-featured
scientific and programmers' calculator for OS/2 2.x and 3.x.  It is a 32-bit
Presentation Manager application that supports drag-and-drop fonts and colors
from a Workplace Shell Palette, automatic resizing of buttons and their text,
multiple and separately-controllable entry and display formats (numeric base
and format conversions with just a press of the <ENTER> key!).  Formats that
are supported in this release include decimal, octal, hexadecimal, currency,
foot-inch, degree-minute-second, fractions, binary, IEEE-754 floating point
hexadecimal dump, scientific notation, engineering notation, and more.

This program is SHAREWARE.  The uploaded version is fully functional but has
a nag screen at startup and cannot save user preferences.  Registration is
$15.00.  The program was uploaded by Fourth Corner Systems, a small company
that is authorized by the author as a distributor for this program.
