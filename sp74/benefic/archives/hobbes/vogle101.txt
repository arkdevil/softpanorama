        here.  I have gotten some requests for it so I'm uploading it
        again.

    VOGLE PM 1.01 (5/10/94)
    A VOGLE driver for OS/2 Presentation Manager

    VOGLE is a library of C routines for doing line drawings and polygon fills 
    in 2 and 3 dimensions.  It handles circles, curves, arcs, patches,
    polygons, and software text in a device independent fashion.  Simple 
    hidden line removal is also available via polygon backfacing.  Access to 
    hardware text and double buffering of drawings depends on the driver.  

    The compiled examples, voglepm.dll, and the Hershey fonts are included in 
    this archive in examples.zip.  (NOTE: the emx dlls are required for the 
    examples)  

    This archive DOES NOT contain everything needed to recompile the VOGLE 
    library.  The VOGLE documentation and the rest of the source code needed 
    to compile the library is available from gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au in
    /pub/vogle.tar.gz.

    Makefiles for emx/gcc and Borland C++ for OS/2 are included in this 
    archive.
