Archive Name: yrn2_076.zip
Description: Store/read USENET news and mail (SOUP format)
Operating System/Version: OS/2 2.x,3.x
Program Source: cthuang@io.org (Chin Huang)
Proposed directory for placement: /os2/32bit/bbs

This is a beta release of PC Yarn, a suite of programs used to store
and read USENET news and mail offline.

Changes:

- The LOGDIR environment variable sets the home directory.  If LOGDIR is
  not defined, the HOME environment variable sets the home directory.

- Instead of the recipient's email address, the recipient's full name is
  now passed as the public key ID to PGP.

- Fix: The import program still corrupted the history file after running
  the "expire -r" command.
