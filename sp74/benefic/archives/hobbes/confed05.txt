Confed 0.5 Initial release Jan 94

Confed is a small utility to modify (or create) an OS/2 config.sys. Unfortunately IBM forgot to include 
such a applet. Special; about confed is the possibility to tap into OS/2 help files.

=== INSTALL ====
Confed is mainly 2 files (this file can be discarded). 
You can copy the EXE file to any place you like and start it from there.
The .hlp file must be in the same directory as the Confed utility or preferable in the OS/2 help directory.

ENJOY.
