<P>
This function "calls" the code which begins at the ProcAddress supplied.
This ProcAddress could be the address obtained by RxQueryProcAddr for the
entry point of a DLL.  But, it can be any "legal" entry point address of
any routine.
<PRE>Syntax:

  procrc = RxCallEntryPoint(procaddr [,arg1 [, arg2 [,...]]] )

where

  procaddr = proc-address (could be obtained from RxQueryProcAddr, etc.)
  parg1
  ...
  parg19   = up to 19 arguments.  If an argument is a valid pointer, the
             pointer will be passed.  If not, a copy of the argument's value
             will be passed by reference.  Either way, the procedure must be
             expecting a pointer for each argument.
  procrc   = return code from the procedure

Note:
  Linkage to the proc-address is type _System.
