<BODY>
<!-- entering slot 19 -->
<P>
This function allows a Rexx program to access and/or alter storage by address.
 This could be used to process data passed to it by a program.  This could
also be used to "Pass By Reference" among Rexx programs when using the RxAllocMem
and RxFreeMem functions.
<PRE>Syntax:

  outdata = RxStorage( pointer [, length] [, indata] )

where

  pointer  = 32-bit pointer (address)
  length   = Length of storage to be queried (defaults to 1)
  indata   = Data to place at address "pointer" for the length of the data
             (regardless of "length" value)
  outdata  = Data at address "pointer" for length "length" (truncated if
             "length" takes you beyond allowed storage)

Note:

  A request to query memory out-of-bounds returns a string up to the bound-
  ary.  A request to set memory out-of-bounds, sets memory up to the bound-
  ary.  All memory is allocated in 4k chunks.  Therefore, some query or set
  operations will access memory up to the next 4k boundary.
