<!-- entering slot 109 -->
<P>
This function allows you to turn HardError and Exception popup on or off.
 This change takes effect for the process in which it is issued, no matter
what the previous setting was, by whom, or on what thread. Presently, there
is no way (that I know of) to query or "reset" these error settings.
<PRE>Syntax:

  dosrc = RxSetError(flag)

where:

  flag  = any combination of:
          'h' to disable HardError popup
          'H' to enable  HardError popup
          'e' to disable Exception popup
          'E' to enable  Exception popup
  dosrc = return code from DosError()

Example:

  Call rxseterror 'eh'  /* would suppress popups from both harderror */
                        /* and exception conditions */
