<P>
This function gives access to shared, un-named memory to a process-id
<PRE>Syntax:

  giverc = RxGiveSharedMem(pointer, pid [,flags])

where

  pointer = valid 32-bit pointer
  pid     = valid process-id (as a decimal integer)
  flags   = any combination of:
            X - Pag_Execute
            R - Pag_Read
            W - Pag_Write
            G - Pag_Guard

for example:

  /* To give shared memory */
  giverc = RxGiveSharedMem(pointer, 23, 'rw')

Note:

  A valid pointer must be supplied.  This is obtained from the process which
  allocated the shared un-named memory via RxAllocSharedMem.  The process-id
  supplied must be valid (i.e. must currently exist).
