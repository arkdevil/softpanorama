<!-- entering slot 101 -->
<P>
This function reads a character stream in from a file handle, rather than
from a file name. 
<PRE>Syntax:

  dosrc = RxRead( rexxvar, hfile [,length] )

where

  rexxvar = name of Rexx variable into which read data is placed
  hfile   = handle of file to be read from
  length  = number of bytes to read (defaults to zero)
  dosrc   = two blank-delimited words:
            1) return code from DosRead
            2) if (1) is zero, an integer indicating number of bytes
               read (should be same as length of rexx variable's
               value)
