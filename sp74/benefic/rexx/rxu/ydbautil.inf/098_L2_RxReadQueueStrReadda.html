</HEAD>

<!-- entering slot 99 -->
<P>
This function returns the de-referenced contents of an OS/2 queue element.
 That is, it dequeues an element and returns the data pointed to by the
dequeued element as the function result.  It first does a DosOpenQueue,
then a DosReadQueue(wait), but does NOT do a DosCloseQueue. 
<PRE>Syntax:

  datastr = RxReadQueueStr(qname)

where

   qname     = name of queue to read
   datastr   = data pointed to by dequeued pointer
