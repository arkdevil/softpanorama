This function allows you to make most UPM calls from a Rexx program.
<PRE>Syntax:

  func  = 'Logon'     For Process level logon, only usable by that process */
          'Logonp'
        = 'Logonu'    For "User" logon, usable by all processes
        = 'Logoff'    For Process level logoff, undoes a "LOGONP"
          'Logoffp'
        = 'Logoffu'   For "User" logoff, undoes a "LOGONU"
        = 'LogonList' Gets list of current active logons
  uid   = 'Userid'    Userid to be logged on/off
        = 'stemname'  Name of Rexx stem variable under which results
                      of "LogonList" are mapped as such:
                      stem.0    - Number of logons reported on
                      stem.n.1  - Userid
                      stem.n.2  - Node/Domain name
                      stem.n.3  - Session-Id
                      stem.n.4  - Logon type (Local/Node/Domain)
  pw    = 'Password'  Password to be used with 'Userid' (for logon)
  type  = 'Local'     Logs you on/off UPM locally (default is LOCAL if
                      no value supplied)
        = 'Node'      Logs you on/off a node
        = 'Domain'    Logs you on/off a LAN domain
        = 'dataBase'  Logs you on/off the correct node for a database
  name  = 'Name'      The name of the node/domain/database, depending on
                      what "TYPE" was chosen
  check = 'Admin'     Checks to see if userid has Admin authority
        = 'User'      Checks to see if userid has User authority
        = 'Config'    Checks to see if logon was done from Config.Sys

  upmrc = RxUpm(func, uid, pw, type, name, check)
