<!-- entering slot 105 -->
<P>
This function writes data from a Rexx queue or stem variable to a file.
 It is meant to be like EXECIO in TSO and VM, and can be used in a similar
fashion for file output. 
<PRE>Syntax:

  info = RxExecO([fname], [action], [name], [type])

where:

  fname  = name of file to be written to (default sends to stdout)
  action = Replace or Append (default is 'Replace')
           replaces or appends to 'fname'
  name   = name of Rexx queue from which to get data (default uses
           current queue)
               or
           name of a Rexx stem variable under which data is mapped as
             stem.1
             stem.2
             ...
             stem.n
           Once an uninitialized value for 'stem.n' is encountered,
           i/o stops.
  type   = 'Queue' or 'Stem' (default is 'Queue')
           this tells whether arg 3 is a Rexx Queue name or a stem
           variable name
  info   = two blank delimited numbers:
           1) number of lines written
           2) total number of bytes written

Example:

  /* Write 100 lines from current queue to c:\junk.dat (replace file) */
  Do 100
    Queue i time('l')
  End
  info = rxexeco('c:\junk.dat','r')
  parse var info lines bytes
  Say lines 'lines were written'
  Say bytes 'bytes were written'
