<!-- entering slot 14 -->
<P>
This function does what the Rexx "Pull" instruction and "LineIn" functions
do, except this function allows you to specify the queue name as part of
the call, regardless of what the current queue may be.
<PRE>Syntax:

  data = RxPullQueue( [qname] [,type] [,rexxvar] )

where:

  qname   = name of Rexx queue to pull from (default is current queue)
  type    = 'Wait' or 'Nowait' (default is 'Wait')
  rexxvar = name of a Rexx variable into which is put the queue-insertion-
            timestamp for the retreived element
  data    = data obtained from queue
