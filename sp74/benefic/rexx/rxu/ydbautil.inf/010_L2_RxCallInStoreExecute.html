<TITLE>RxCallInStore - Execute a string as a program</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<!-- entering slot 11 -->
<P>
This function allows the Rexx program developer to execute a string as though
it were a Rexx program.  This allows you to build the equivalent of a Rexx
program's text in a variable, and then execute it from the string.  Actually,
the Rexx program text can come from anywhere -- a file, over a communications
link, from a database. For repeated execution of a program, use "RxTokenize"
to "compile" the program, then call "RxCallInStore" with "&amp;" to re-use
the tokenized program.
<PRE>Syntax:

  result = RxCallInStore strtext, arg1, arg2, ..., arg19

where:

  strtext  = text of a Rexx program, complete with crlf and eof markers
                  or
             a '$' immediately preceding a source program string
                  or
             a '&amp;' immediately preceding a tokenized program string
  arg1     = arguments to the called program
  ...
  arg19

Note:

  Example of executing a program string:

    crlf = '0d0a'x
    str = '/* Rexx */'crlf
    str = str 'Do i=1 To Arg()'crlf
    str = str '  Say "Arg#"i "= {"arg(i)"}"'crlf
    str = str 'End'crlf
    str = str||'1a'x       /* EOF marker */
    call rxcallinstore str, date(), time()
               ( or )
    call rxcallinstore '$'str, date(), time()
               ( or )
    tstr = rxtokenize(str)
    call rxcallinstore '&amp;'tstr, date(), time()
