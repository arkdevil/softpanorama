<TITLE>RxCreateRexxThread - Rexx on another thread</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<!-- entering slot 73 -->
<P>
This function executes a Rexx program on another thread of the same process.
 The started Rexx program has a separate variable pool, and maintains its
own "current Rexx queue", indpendently of the starting Rexx program.  But
all other features of multi-threaded applications apply (i.e. shared file
handles, etc.)
<PRE>Syntax:

  tid = RxCreateRexxThread(execname [,arg1 [,arg2 [, ...]]])

where

  execname = name of Rexx program to execute
                   or
             a '$' immediately preceding a source program string
                   or
             a '&amp;' immediately preceding a tokenized program string
             (for more info about these, see "RxCallInStore" and
              "RxTokenize")
  arg1     = arguments to Rexx program (up to 19 possible)
  arg2
  ...
  tid      = Thread-Id of new thread

Note:

  Example of executing a program string:

    crlf = '0d0a'x
    str = '/* Rexx */'crlf
    str = str 'Do i=1 To Arg()'crlf
    str = str '  Say "Arg#"i "= {"arg(i)"}"'crlf
    str = str 'End'crlf
    str = str||'1a'x       /* EOF marker */
    call rxcreaterexxthread '$'str, date(), time()
