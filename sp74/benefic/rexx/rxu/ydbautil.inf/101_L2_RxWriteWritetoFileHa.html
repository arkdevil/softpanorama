<!-- entering slot 102 -->
<P>
This function writes a character stream out to a file handle, rather than
from a file name. 
<PRE>Syntax:

  dosrc = RxWrite( hfile , data )

where

  hfile = handle of file to be written to
  data  = data to be written to file
  dosrc   = two blank-delimited words:
            1) return code from DosWrite
            2) if (1) is zero, an integer indicating number of bytes
               written (may not be same as length of data supplied)
