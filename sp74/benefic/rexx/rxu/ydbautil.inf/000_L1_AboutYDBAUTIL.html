<P>
YDBAUTIL is a package of diverse OS/2 Rexx External Functions. Some functions
in this package work with features of Extended Services (ES), although you
do not need to have ES installed to use the non-ES functions. Almost all
the functions in this package are in use in many of my own programs and
are fairly well de-bugged.  Please let me know of any problems you encounter
in using the functions, or of any suggestions for enhancements to existing
functions, or ideas for new ones.
<PRE>
  With the functions in the YDBAUTIL function package, you can make
  use of some of OS/2's most powerful facilities, such as multi-threading,
  processes, sessions, semaphores, shared memory, OS/2 queues, etc.
  Some of these features are not only useful in pure Rexx applications,
  but they allow you to write Rexx programs which can talk to compiled
  programs on their level (i.e. reference memory by address, use
  semaphores, etc.).

  Another benefit is the ability to quickly prototype real OS/2 programs
  using real OS/2 APIs so that you can cheaply 'prove' techniques
  before committing them to 'C' code.

  The capabilities provided to Rexx programs by this package, in
  conjunction with those provided by other Rexx function packages
  (database access, APPC, etc.) and the base language itself allow
  you to prototype or build Rexx applications with much of the
  functional sophistication (and complexity, unfortunately) of "real"
  OS/2 applications.

  In addition to the many OS/2 API "passthrough" functions, there are
  some Rexx-specific enhancements and additions.
