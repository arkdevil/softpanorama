<TITLE>RxPmPrintf - Write lines to a PMPrintf Monitor</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<!-- entering slot 10 -->
<P>
This function writes data lines to a PMPrintf "Monitor" program.
<PRE>Syntax:

  bytes = RxPmPrintf(qname, [data1 [,data2 [,data3 [...]]]] )

where:

  qname    = name of PMPrintf queue
             If blank, uses default PMPrintf Queue (PRINTF32).
  data1    = data to be written to PMPrintf
  ...        Each argument is written as a separate line
  datan

  bytes    = number of bytes written in this operation

Notes:

  The PMPrintf tool can be downloaded from the OS/2 Bulletin Board.
  This Rexx function does work with PMPrintf v2.5, but may not work
  with earlier versions.  You can start the PMPrintf program with
  a command line argument specifying an alternate queue name for it
  to use.  This queue name can be supplied as the first argument of
  RxPmPrintf to direct the data to a specific running instance of
  PMPrintf.

  If only the queue name is supplied (i.e. args 2-n are not supplied),
  nothing at all is written to queue.  If an argument has zero length,
  no data will be written to the queue for that argument (i.e. you
  must supply at least one byte to be written to queue).
