<!-- entering slot 44 -->
<P>
This function queries a mutex semaphore's attributes
<PRE>Syntax:

  mtxinfo = RxQueryMutexSem( hmtx )

where

  hmtx    = existing mutex semaphore handle
  mtxinfo = four blank delimited tokens:
            1) return code from DosQueryMutexSem
            2) Process-Id of semaphore's current owner
            3) Thread-Id of semaphore's current owner
            4) A count of the number of calls to DosRequestMutexSem,
               minus the number of calls to DosReleaseMutexSem, that have
               been made for the semaphore by the owning thread.
               If the semaphore is unowned, this value will be zero.
               If the owning thread has ended, the value will be the
               request count for the ended owner.
