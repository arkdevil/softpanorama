<P>
This release contains fixes for some minor problems and includes help information
for OS/2 queue functions (which were there for v.10 but I forgot to document).
 I have tried this on OS/2 v2.1 GA code and it seems to work just fine.
 This function package will only work on OS/2 2.x as it is 32-bit code.
