<!-- entering slot 104 -->
<P>
This function reads (text) data into a Rexx queue or stem variable from
a file.  It is meant to be like EXECIO in TSO and VM, and can be used in
a similar fashion for file input. 
<PRE>Syntax:

  info = RxExecI([fname], [qtype], [name], [type])

where:

  fname  = name of file to be read from (default reads from stdin)
  qtype  = 'Lifo' or 'Fifo' (default is 'Fifo')
           determines how lines are read onto queue
           (ignored for stems)
  name   = name of Rexx queue from into which data is read (default uses
           current queue)
               or
           name of a Rexx stem variable under which data is to be mapped as
             stem.0 = number of lines (stem.1 - stem.n)
             stem.1
             stem.2
             ...
             stem.n
  type   = 'Queue' or 'Stem' (default is 'Queue')
           this tells whether arg 3 is a Rexx Queue name or a stem
           variable name
  info   = two blank delimited numbers:
           1) number of lines read
           2) total number of bytes read

Example:

  /* Read a text file into the Rexx stem 's.' */
  info = rxexeci('c:\config.sys',,'s.','s')
  parse var info lines bytes
  Say lines 'lines were read'
  Say bytes 'bytes were read'
