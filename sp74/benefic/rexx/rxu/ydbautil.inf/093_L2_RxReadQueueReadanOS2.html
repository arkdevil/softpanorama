  dosrc = RxReadQueue(rexxstem,qhandle,elemcode,waitcode,semhandle)

where

   rexxstem  = name of Rexx stem, under which info is returned:
               stem.1 = data pointer (e.g. for use with RxStorage)
               stem.2 = data length (of that pointed to by stem.1)
               stem.3 = PID of process which enqueued element
               stem.4 = event code (RequestData.ulData)
               stem.5 = element priority
   qhandle   = handle to queue
   elemcode  = element code (integer)
   waitcode  = whether to wait for data in queue
               W = Wait
               N = Nowait
