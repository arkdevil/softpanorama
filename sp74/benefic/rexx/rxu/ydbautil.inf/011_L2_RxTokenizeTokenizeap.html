<!-- entering slot 12 -->
<P>
This function in effect "compiles" a program source string for re-use with
subsequent "RxCallInstore" or "RxCreateRexxThread" calls. This provides
better performance when a program string is repeatedly called.
<PRE>Syntax:

  tokenstr = RxTokenize(progstr)

where:

  progstr  = actual Rexx program source string
  tokenstr = tokenized ("compiled") result of "progstr"

Note:

  This function, in conjunction with the "RxCallInstore" and/or
  "RxCreateRexxThread" functions, can be used to achieve the same
  effect as the Rexx Macrospace, except that this technique is local
  to the program using it (whereas the Macrospace is system global).
