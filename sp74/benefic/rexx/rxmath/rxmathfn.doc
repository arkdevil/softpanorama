               Basic Mathematic Functions for use with OS/2 REXX

The following functions are provided in RxMathFn.  Note that these
functions are a subset of those available with the C Set/2 compiler.
All trigonometric functions deal with radians.  All functions return
strings with a C Set/2 "double" precision of 15 digits after decimal
point, or in scientific notation if neccessary.  If you have shorter
precision (NUMERIC DIGITS) set in your REXX environment, the value
returned from RxMathFn functions will be converted by REXX at the
first use in arithmetic operation,

   cos(x)     - cosine of x
   sin(x)     - sine of x
   tan(x)     - tangent of x

   acos(x)    - arc cosine of x
   asin(x)    - arc sine of x
   atan(x)    - arc tangent of x

   cosh(x)    - hyperbolic cosine of x
   sinh(x)    - hyperbolic sine of x
   tanh(x)    - hyperbolic tangent of x

   ceil(x)    - smallest integer >= x
   floor(x)   - largest  integer <= x

   exp(x)     - e to the power x (e is natural logarithm base)
   log(x)     - natural logarithm of x
   log10(x)   - base 10 logarithm of x

   sqrt(x)    - square root of x
   pow(x,y)   - x to the power y

   pi()       - the value of pi
   e()        - the value of e

============
Installation
============
To register all the math functions in RxMathFn.dll, you need to
execute the following function calls in REXX:

   rc = RxFuncAdd("MathLoadFuncs","RxMathFn","MathLoadFuncs")
   rc = MathLoadFuncs()

The first statement registers the MathLoadFuncs function in RxMathFn,
and the second statement calls the MathLoadFuncs function to load in
the rest of the functions.  You may call these functions as often
as you like, but you only need to do it once until the next time your
computer is re-booted.

MathLoadFuncs displays copyright information.  To suppress it call it
with the "Quiet" parameter.
   rc = MathLoadFuncs("Quiet")

============
Removal
============
Once RxMathFn.dll has been installed, and you need to remove it from
memory to either delete the DLL or to replace it, you need to execute
the Rexx function MathDropFuncs() within Rexx.  This will unregister
all the math functions.  You then need to exit all currently running
CMD.EXE sessions.  Once you've done this, the DLL will be dropped from
the system, and you will be able to remove or replace it.


===============
Special strings
===============

Two special strings can be returned as the result from RxMathFn
functions:

 - "nan"      - defined as the result of 0/0;
 - "infinity" - defined as the result of 1/0.

Both of the special strings can be preceded with the minus sign to
indicate negative result ( -1/0 ).
