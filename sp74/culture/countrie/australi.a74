PART I

1. ABOUT SOC.CULTURE.AUSTRALIAN

The soc.culture.australian newsgroup was established in November 1990,
thanks largely to Ann Nicholson's persistent efforts.  It is devoted
to the discussion of all aspects of Australian culture.  Brad
Alexander (brad@winnie.cs.adelaide.edu.au) posts a weekly "oznews"
current affairs digest. Iain Sinclair put together the first FAQ for
this group. Ann Nicholson took it over in early 1993. She did a major
reorganisation in June 1994 before handing it over to Stephen Wales
(stephenw@mincom.oz.au) in July 1994.

There are many other related newsgroups.  If your article is more
appropriate for another newsgroup, please post it there first --
you'll get the audience you're looking for.

If you're unable to post to or read the aus hierarchy, talk to
your system administrator about getting a feed. Since many people
cannot get a feed for the aus hierarchy, cross-postings to s.c.a.
and aus.* are welcome.

This FAQ for soc.culture.australian (and quite a few other newsgroups)

2. HOW TO FIND AUSTRALIANS, AUSTRALIAN INFORMATION

2.1 Addresses on the Net

2.1.1 Public Access Sites 

Send mail to netfaq@zikzak.apana.org.au for a listing of public access
sites in Australia, with Subject: Network Access in Australia, and
First line in Body: Network Access in Australia

These are all dialup sites; most should offer news and mail for some
fee (UNIX, unless stated otherwise).  APANA (the Australian Public
Access Network Association) covers some of these.  For more info on
other sites in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide and Brisbane, potential
users can mail info@apana.org.au.

Melb:  Cloud 		postmaster@cloud.apana.org.au [msdos]
Melb:  Werple	  	postmaster@werple.apana.org.au		 03 888 1726

Pegasus is now based in Brisbane and has an (07) dial-up number. It is
fully internetted and you can telnet to it (peg.apc.org) or within
Australia reach it via AUSPAC x.25 switching (but this method is
billed at a higher rate).  They are a member of the APC just like
GreenNet or the Web. [Scot]

[JS] DIALix is a commercial Internet access provider, with access for
business, personal, and student use. DIALix now offers live Internet
services (ftp, telnet, talk, finger etc) in addition to e-mail and
Usenet news groups.  Charges are 1c/minute for connection and 1c/1000
bytes for non-DIALixNet (Internet/AARNet) traffic. All accounts are
"in advance". Minimum annual usage of Business $250, Personal $80,
Student $10. Permanent live DIALixNet and Internet connections also
available. Further info from:

There is now an Australiana Gopher open in Canada, maintained by Tim
Little (little@ere.umontreal.ca).

Name=MegaGopher, Type=1, Port=70, Path=, Host=megasun.bch.umontreal.ca
Stuff of interest on the MegaGopher includes:

The editors are: David G. Green (david.green@anu.edu.au), 
                 Jim Croft      (jrc@anbg.gov.au). 

* Australian Newsletter

There is a newsletter called "Word From Down Under" published out of
LA.  The publisher is Neil Brandom.  He is an Aussie living in LA.  It
contains all the latest info on Oz.  Subscriptions for 26 issues cost
$34.95US.  You can contact Neil at 72506.23@compuserve.com or write to
him at:

2.1.3 On-line Weather Information [IC]

It's possible to find out the current weather for any state of
Australia from the Victorian Bureau of Meterology via telnet.

GOPHER: The Bureau of Meteorology has just set up a Gopher server to
provide forecast information for each state and territory around
Australia.  Currently only textual information is available, but we
hope to add charts and satellite images sometime in the future.  The
server is known as "babel.ho.bom.gov.au" and should be accessible
through AARNET at the normal Gopher port (i.e port 70).  Please note :
This service is initially purely experimental and will not be
supported outside normal office hours. Contact : Justin Baker, Central
Operations and Systems Branch, Bureau of Meteorology, Melbourne,
Australia e-mail : justinb@bom.gov.au.

There's also another gopher with Australian weather, at
gopher.austin.unimelb.edu.au, the Austin hospital in Melbourne.
(Search general, then weather.)  I found this on a gopher menu at
Michigan State University. [AE]

2.1.4 Finding people

* Currently about 30 academic institutions in Australia offer Gopher
servers. If you have access to gopher you can use these servers to
examine local email directories. Unfortunately this facility appears
to be restricted to educational institutions, there's nothing
available in the .com.au hierarchy.  [2/93, CP]

* For organizations, it's best to use nslookup (read the manual pages
first).  Example session:
    % nslookup
    > server aarnet.edu.au
    > ls edu.au
    [...]
There's also the information posted in comp.mail.maps occasionally --
most of it is dated, but some of it might be helpful.

* For people, mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with "send
usenet-addresses/[name]" in the body of the message.  If [name]
has posted to Usenet in the last few months, the mail server will
send back a list of matches.  Otherwise, try:
    telnet bruno.cs.colorado.edu, login as netfind.
    telnet NIC.DDN.MIL, login as whois.
(Not very useful -- user has to explicitly register with the server.)

* Another resource which is slowly being developed is the X.500
directory system. Gateways into this system can be found on many
gopher servers both within and outside Australia (e.g. there is one
accessible fromn the gopher at Monash university). The system
currently contains address information for about 80 commercial,
academic and scientific organisations.

2.1.5 Other

* Information on extinct, endangered, and vulnerable species available
from the Environmental Resources Information Network gopher at ANU.

* The Australian Computer Society national office is now on-line: [JL]

2.2 Other Addresses

* Most reasonable libraries should stock the "College Collection on
Microfiche", which contains copies of faculty handbooks/catalogs from
Australian Universities and Colleges of Advanced Education.  Large
libraries should also have copies of recent Australian telephone
books.

* There is also an English(?) publication, the "Commonwealth
Universities Yearbook", that has summaries of the programs and staff
of Australian and other Commonwealth universities.  This appears to be
a standard reference and widely available.

* If you need to get in touch with someone pretty dramatically, try
sending a wild fax to 'Tonight Live' (a poor 'Letterman' clone, +61 3
690 8749).

* The address of the Australian Computer Society is:
	Australian Computer Society     Tel: (02) 211 5855
	National Office                 Fax: (02) 281 1208

3.1 Australian Citizenship

Informally, you are an Australian citizen if one of the following applies:
- you are born in Australia
- you are born overseas to Australian parents and they register your birth
- you become a naturalised Australian
and
- you don't do anything to give up your citizenship

3.2 Australian (Dual) Citizenship [CW]

Here are some excerpts form the "Hints for Australian Travellers"
booklet produced by the Dept. of Foreign Affairs - its the little
booklet you get when you get your passport (at least it was a year
ago...). Portions in [...] are my comments. [CW]

* Nationality or Citizenship

Each country is free to determine who it will regard as its citizens,
and under what conditions its citizenship can be acquired or lost.
Citizenship laws are often complex and they can be quite different
from Australian laws.  In many countries, for example, citizenship is
not considered to be lost simply because the person has acquired
Australian citizenship.  The laws of some countries require people who
wish to renounce their citizenship to make formal written application
to do so.  Because of such laws many Australian citizens are also
citizens of other countries and therefore, possess what is
internationally referred to as "dual nationality".

[translation - dual citizenship is possible; whether or not you retain
your original citizenship upon becoming an Australian depends on the
laws of the original country.]

* Dual Nationality

Australian citizens who hold another citizenship are likely to be
those who:
o   were not born in Australia;
o   were born in Australia but had one or both parents or grandparents
    who were not born in Australia;
o   are married to a person with another citizenship.

[stuff deleted about being citizen of certain countries may make
you subject to certain laws if you return...]

* Loss of Australian Citizenship

Australia provides in its own citizenship law that an Australian
citizen, who is 18 years of age or over, who does an act or thing, the
sole or dominant purpose of which is to acquire the citizenship of
another country, ceases to be an Australian citizen from the date he
or she becomes a citizen of that country.

If you marry a citizen of a foreign country you may, under the law of
that country, automatically become a citizen of that country. Under
these circumstances you will not lose your Australian citizenship
provided you are not required to take any further action yourself (eg.
registration) to acquire your spouse's citizenship.

If you lose Australian citizenship as a result of doing an act or
thing to acquire another citizenship, you can apply to regain it by
grant any time after 12 months from the date of loss, provided you are
in Australia and have been present there as a resident for 12 months
in the 2 years immediately prior to lodging your application.
Alternatively, you can apply to resume Australian citizenship by
making a declaration to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government
and Ethnic Affairs that at the time you did the act or thing:

o you did not know that by doing it you would cease to be an
  Australian citizen; or
o if you had not done it, you would have suffered significant
  hardship or detriment.

The person making the declaration must:

o have been legally present in Australia for a period, or periods,
  amounting in aggregate to not less than 2 years; and
o intend to continue to reside in Australia or, if living overseas,
  intend to return to reside in Australia within 3 years of making the
  declaration; and
o have maintained a close and continuing association with Australia
  whilst abroad.

If the Minister believes the statement is true, he may register the
declaration and you may become an Australian citizen again.

Persons needing up-to-date information should consult the Department
of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs or an Australian
mission overseas.

A child under 18 years of age loses Australian citizenship if his/her
responsible parent or guardian ceases to be an Australian citizen, and
o he/she possesses another citizenship at the time, and
o his/her other responsible parent is not an Australian citizen
  at the time.

Should you lose Australian citizenship before your 18th birthday, as a
result of a responsible parent ceasing to be an Australian citizen,
you can, within one year after your 18th birthday (or later if special
circumstances apply), make a declaration that you wish to resume
Australian citizenship on the date the declaration is registered.

Anyone who loses Australian citizenship is no longer entitled to hold
an Australian passport. If you think you may acquire another
nationality in some way, you should seek advice about the effect this
would have on your Australian nationality from Australian authorities.

* Children born overseas

A child born outside Australia may be registered as an Australian
citizen by descent at the time of birth of the child.  Registration
must be made within 18 years of the child's birth by a responsible
parent or guardian.  Applications can be obtained from any Australian
mission overseas or the department of Immigration (etc.) in Australia.

[translation - if an Australian deliberately acquires citizenship of a
foreign country, they lose citizenship for at least a year... if it is
involuntary then there is no problem...]

[SW] Personal experience on dual citizenship for Australians with
children born abroad.  The child automatically has the citizenship of
the foreign country. To register as an Australian by descent, you have
to provide originals of both parents birth certificates, the child's
birth certificate, the parent's marriage certificate (if appropriate)
and parent's passports.  Send all of this plus the correct form and
$80 USD (in the USA) (rate as of May 1993) to the appropriate consulate 
for the region you live in and then eventually you get a Certificate 
of Australian Citizenship by Descent for the child.  To get a five 
(5) year child's passport you must present yourself (in Person) at 
a Consulate or Embassy with the passport photos, the application form 
and the appropriate endorsement on the photos. They'll then give you 
the passport.

* Joint US/Australian from a US perspective 

[ZS] The situation with USA citizenship is that the US constitution
says that anyone born or naturalised in the USA is a citizen.  US
citizenship is a right, not a privilege.  US citizenship cannot be
taken away from you against your will.  However, you still have the
right to renounce it, and other countries often require you to do so
in order to become naturalised.  This used to be the case in Australia
up till 1986.  The oath of citizenship used to include the phrase
`renouncing all other allegiance'.  When the oath was changed in 1986,
it became possible for US citizens to become naturalised Australians
without losing their US status.

The US doesn't like it, and for many years the local US consulates
actively tried to bamboozle USAns into renouncing their US citizenship
if they became Australians.  If you sign anything acknowledging that
you have renounced, or give away your US passport, or anything of that
nature, the USA will assume that you have voluntarily renounced, and
it's up to you to go to court and prove otherwise.

I was born in the USA, have lived here since the age of six, and was
naturalised in 1989.  The Department of Immigration demanded that I
turn in my US passport, because they had an agreement with the US
embassy to do so, and return the passports to the embassy.  I insisted
that I didn't want to lose my US citizenship, and they refused to
process my application until I gave over my passport.  They said if I
needed it before the naturalisation went through, I could get it back,
so after a long argument I gave them my passport, and then on the day
before my naturalisation ceremony I went in and asked for the return
of my US passport.  On the form they gave me, under `reason', I ticked
`other', and wrote that I wanted it back because I didn't want to lose
it.  I don't know whether they read the form or not, but I got the
passport back.

Then I got a letter from the US consulate.  The Department had
informed them of my naturalisation, and they asked me to fill in a
questionairre, with the questions slanted to produce answers that
would constitute voluntary renunciation.  I sent them a letter
explaining why I refused to fill in the questionairre, and setting out
quite clearly the circumstances.  I regarded the very fact that I had
my passport as the greatest proof that I wanted to keep it.  I got a
letter that my case was on hold.

A few months ago I went in to the consulate to renew my passport, and
they were a bit more helpful.  The attitude seems to have changed in
the past few years.  They still made me fill in the same
questionairre, but I did it in front of them, explaining verbally my
objections and putting down N/A all over the place, and waited there
until I got an official determination that I retain my citizenship.  I
probably made a nuisance of myself, but I insist on my constitutional
rights.  If they don't like it, let them change the constitution.

[FN] The following is a short extract from the (US) Dual Citizenship
FAQ, available via Internet anonymous FTP from mks-gate.mks.com
(142.77.7.224), as "usr/richw/dualcit", or via e-mail by sending a
message to: richw@mks.com with the Subject: send dualcit

.The US State Department now says that it will assume that a US
citizen intends to =retain= his US citizenship if he (1) is
naturalized in a foreign country, (2) takes a routine oath of
allegiance to a foreign country, or (3) accepts foreign government
employment that is of a "non-policy-level" nature.  A person in such a
situation will eventually be asked to fill out a State Department
questionnaire on the subject (e.g., the next time he/she applies for
renewal of a passport); but unless he/she affirmatively intended to
give up US citizenship, no action will be taken to revoke said
citizenship...

The minus side of retaining US citizenship is that the IRS retains
rights to tax worldwide income, and say you must file even when the
deductions cancel out the tax. I have met many US citizens living
outside the US who ignore this - how does this work out when they
apply for passport renewals?

[Any US citizens in Australia care to comment on this last question ? -SW]

* Australian/Canadian

[FN] According to the 1977 Citizenship Act, which applies to all who were
Canadian citizens as of Feb. 15, 1977 or later, citizenship is a right
that cannot be revoked by the voluntary act of a citizen in doing such
things as applying for citizenship in another country, or being absent
from Canada for any length of time. Has anything happened to change
this? 

[How about a Canadian answering this one ? -SW]

of a short term nature and is not going to disadvantage a local
resident. Persons not usually included within this, or other visitor
provisions are entertainers coming to perform and religious workers
entering for religious activities.

Study. Visitors may undertake study in Australia provided it is:
- non-formal or recreational in nature,

severe and non-reported currency may be seized.

* Migrating to Australia (957i January 1994)

Everyone who is not an Australian or New Zealander needs a visa for
Australia.

3.3.2 For Australians in other Countries

* Visa requirements for Australians in Britain

[I have heard both that Australians need a visa, and that they don't! 
Needs updating. AN]

* Visa requirements for Australians in the United States

[No guarantee that these are completely up-to-date or accurate]

Visa for the US are as follows:

J-1: Exchange Visitor visa (for students, researchers).

* student J-1, J-2 experience [SD]

I am here at Penn State University to do a PhD. The max amount of
time I was given to do this is 6 years. I applied for a J1 visa so
that my husband would be on a J2, this allows him to apply for a work
permit (which he now has - the application was not as straightforward
as we were led to believe, let me know if you are interested in any
details). Initially I was on funding for 1 year, and as a result our
visas were valid for one year only, even though all my paperwork said I
was accepted into a PhD program of at most 6 years. With my J1 visa
comes a pink form called the IAP-66. This form, not the actual visa is
our permit to reside in the US. The visa is for (re-)entry purposes
only. 

My supervisor recently acquired 4 more years of funding for me, so I
got my IAP-66 renewed without any problems, the university took care
of it and it was all done within a week. The visa, however, is another
story. It is not possible to apply for a US visa within the US or even
from Canada! I wouldn't trust Mexico, so the only safe option would be
to go home and re-apply.  We want to travel to Canada, Mexico, etc
while we are here, so not having a valid visa is a huge pain!! I have
been assured that with a valid IAP-66 it is trivial to get a new visa.
So when applying people should make sure they have funding for the
entire period that they plan to be in the US, that way both visa and
IAP-66 will be valid and you can travel outside the US during your
stay.  When I applied I think it cost A$120, they wanted a letter from
the university that accepted me including financial details and proof
of US$5000 in our bank account. It took about 4 or 5 weeks for the
embassy to process everything.

And yes, when I am done here, I have to go home. I applied in June
1993, and I think the amount of personal funds has gone up to 5400 US
dollars now. This money, plus my University stipend is meant to
support both my husband and myself.  They will allow a J2 to work, but
only for their own benefit (to see the country and do other activities
and just to have something to do), but NOT to support a J1.  A J1 is
only allowed to work in the job they came to the US for, a student is
allowed to work on campus only (I tutored during my first year here,
officially called a TA - teaching assistant). A J2 can work anywhere
they like, but their visa and work permit are valid only with a valid
J1 IAP-66 form.  Another thing to note is that the immigration service
is as changeable as the weather, they change their rules very
frequently.

* postdoc J-1 experience [AN]

I came in on a J-1 for my postdoc at Brown University. Brown organised
my original IAP-66 for my 1-year contract. I took the IAP-66 to the US
consulate in Melbourne, with passport, passport photo, filled in the
appropriate form, paid them money and acquired a J-1 visa for a
year. When my contract was extended for a second year, again, Brown
filled out the IAP-66 form, and I sent it off to Immigration in the
US, together with US$80, and got it validated. I was supposed
to get the actual visa in my passport the next time I went out of the
country. As it happened, I went to Bermuda for Christmas, arriving
late on Dec 23rd, nothing (consulates, etc) was open until after
Boxing Day, when I was due to leave, so I could not get my visa done.
So I just explained this to the person at Immigration (which was
actually done in Bermuda) and that seemed to be ok. When I was next in
Melbourne, I filled in the same form, gave in my passport, a photo,
and another A$158! I was very annoyed about having to pay again, but
as I was told rather rudely, lots of people would be happy to pay a
lot to be able to work in the USA!

J-1 holders are called non-resident aliens.

U.S. Visa Type J-2: For spouse of J-1 holder.  A J-2 can work anywhere
they like, but their visa and work permit are valid only with a valid
J1 IAP-66 form.

U.S. Visa Type H-1

An initial h-1 is issued for 3 years, it can be extended for 3 more
years. If you change jobs on an h-1, your new company has to get you a
new one in their name, but the time period does not reset i.e. you
cannot remain in the us more than 6 years after you first get an H-1.
[NF]

U.S. Visa Type L-1 [DS]
 
L-1 visa a working visa issued to foreign citizens working for U.S.
corporations.  They are known as Intercompany Transferee visa and are
typically valid for a period of three years from the date of issue,
although this can usually be extended for an additional 3 years.
Application for an L-1 must be made on your behalf by the employer.
Holders of L-1 status are known as "Non resident Aliens" (charming
name really).  I am not sure of the cost of an L-1 as typically it is
paid for by the employer.
 
Dependents of L-1 holders are recipients of L-2 status.  L-2 holders
are not permitted to work.
 
Approval of an application for L-1 status is dependent on some or
all of the following:
 
        1.  Period of employment with the U.S. firm
        2.  Specific reasons why the beneficiary is uniquely
            qualified for the particular task
        3.  Evidence that the job in question has been advertised
            and no suitable applicants found 
 
 
Any L-1 holder that has travelled outside the U.S. will have
learned that re-entry into the U.S., even with your valid passport
and visa, is near impossible without some additional documentation.
Typically, an L-1 holder will need to carry:
                
        1.  The *original*, repeat *original*, petition approval 
            (I have been asked for this document on each re-entry --
            [DS]) 
        2.  A letter from the sponsoring employer stating
            your continuing employment with the company (signed
            notorized and dated within 3 months)
 
[NF] I am here on the L-1 visa, basically for executives or essential
technical personnel on intra-company transfers.  For example, I worked
for a company which had offices in Adelaide and Santa Clara and
transferred between the two on the basis of technical knowledge which
I possessed. This is a nice visa to get because you don't have to do
labour certification to get a green card which speeds up the process
somewhat. 

Green Card

Basically, you apply, fill in the (what seems like) thousands of
forms, and wait. If you're over here on an H-1 or L-1 visa it's pretty
much a formality (especially with the new H-1's that already have
labour certification). [NF]

Becoming a citizen.

[Entry needed. AN]

* Visa requirements for Australians in France [JB]

Yes, Australians need visas fro France. In 1986 (je croix), it might
have been 1987, there were some bombings in Lyons, which were
suspected to have been done by <ethnic-minority> fanatics. In the
midst of the howls of "what is the government doing about it", the
French Govt, in a particularly stupid knee-jerk reaction, brought in a
requirement that visas will be required for all non-EC nationals. (As
if needing a visa ever stopped a terrorist. And the border checks had
long since gone.)

This rule is waived in cases where there is a bi-lateral agreement,
e.g.  with New Zealand, and in cases where it was feared to hurt the
tourist trade, e.g. US. As Australia doesn't play footsies about visas
for visitors, we need them to go to France.

French visas are in two flavours:

(a) less than 90 days. These are done over-the-counter here. They cost
FF200 (about $A54). I had to provide a letter for my 19-yo son stating
that we were supporting him financially, etc. Otherwise they would
have wanted bank statement proving he had enough money to live on in
France.

(b) 90 days - 1 yr. Do get these I needed:
(i) three interviews at the consulate;
(ii) FF600 ($A162)  per person in cash or bank cheques.
(iii) the letter of invitation from the French university
(iv) a letter from Monash saying everything about my status, salary,
travel grants, insurance, etc.
(v) tickets or confirmed itinerary
(vi) a medical certificate, in French, from an approved physician
(only one in Melbourne!) certifying:
        A) good health
        B) free of TB (X-ray result)
        C) free of syphilis (blood test) [the French bureaucracy hasn't
        discovered AIDS or hepatitis yet.]
Once I had all these, my application, because it was "pour la
sabbatique" had to be couriered off to Canberra to be "assessed" by
the Scientific & Cultural Attache at the French Embassy.  Well it's
all done. Each of the long-term visas set us back about $250 (such
medicals are, rightly, not covered by Medibank.)  Fortunately the
consulate staff were very helpful, polite and understanding. The total
time was was nearly two months, largely due to the queuing delays in
waiting for inteviews and medicals.

3.4.2 The Immigration Process

To get the relevant forms, write to an Australian consulate and they
will send you some info asking you to send them some money (about $5)
for the forms.  When you get these forms you send about half a ream of
photocopies back with the "application processing fee" of $250 (this
fee is regardless of which class you are applying under !!).  If they
decide that they like you, you need to get various medicals done
(which in England cost about #100) with a nominated (probably private)
practice - if you happen to be a medical doctor, mention this when
making your appointment and they don't charge you (as my wife found
out :-).  This medical includes an AIDS test (Note: this can stuff up
your life insurance in the UK) as well as X-rays for TB, checks for a
bad heart and anything else that will cost Australia lots of money.
The whole application process takes a minimum of 3 months (once you
have sent them the forms).  All correspondence must be by mail.

With the points test, if you are <30, have a degree or trade (plus
some experience) and can speak English you pass.  As a friend of mine
found, being employed on a graduate program doesn't count as
experience.  He was also told "even if you had the experience we don't
need any professional buyers at the moment".  That is, passing the
points test only eliminates a reason for not letting you in.  Some
occupations get preferential treatment, but as of October 1992, there
are no occupations on the list, although these change with the times.
If you have a criminal record there's probably not much point
applying.

Should you get past all this, you get a visa stamped in your passport
that is both for migration in the next year and multiple-entry for the
next 4 years.  They also send you lots of stuff telling you that there
is little chance of getting a job at the moment.  [PW]

After you make the points test, you submit your application.  You also
neads loads of other official papers to make an application (marriage
license if you're married, certifications from your jobs if you've
been working, etc.).  After application, you also need to pass a
medical test and provide a set of chest x-rays and other things, but
they'll tell you when they want you to do it (I guess it's to save you
money if you flunk the points test).  The whole process takes four
months at least.  When and if you pass and are granted permission to
migrate, you have the opportunity to move within the space of one
year, and are given to enter and leave Oz freely for a period of four
years after that. [CB]

[CD] adds: I had to file ALL forms, including medical and educational
forms, etc.  at the same time. I was applying as spouse and you can
still get turned down if your medical or criminal record offends. If
the embassy/consulate has to send things back to Australia for
approval it can take MUCH longer.

3.4.3 Criteria and Points System 

In summary, to immigrate to Australia, you must fall under one
of the following categories.

* Family (almost automatic): spouse, de-facto spouse, immediate family
* Skill:
- you have a job that was advertised extensively in Australia without success
- you pass the points test, and they feel like letting you in
- "distinguished talent" ie., bloody good at sport
* Special eligibility: former citizen, former resident, relative of a 
  New Zealander living in Australia

There are two ways to get entry to Oz; via an Independent Entry Class
and via a Concessional Family Class.  The former works if you just
say, "Hey, I want to go to OZ" and put in an application.  The latter
works if you have a family member in Oz who is willing to vouch for
you.  You can only rack up points in one of the two categories.
Here's the list of points:

CONCESSIONAL FAMILY VISA CLASS AND INDEPENDENT ENTRANT VISA CLASS

Employability Factor
  80  Trade certificate/degree/diploma, 3 years post-qualification work, 
        on Priority Occupation List [changes yearly].
  70  Trade certificate/degree, 3 years post-qualification work
  60  Trade certificate/degree, between 6 months and 3 years post 
        qualification work.
  55  Diploma, 3 years post-qualification work.
  50  Diploma, between 6 months and 3 years post-qualification work.
  30  Trade cert/degree/diploma (recognised by overseas authorities 
        and assessed by Australian authorities), and 3 years 
        post-qualification work.
  25  Trade cert/degree/diploma but qualifications held are unacceptable.
  25  Post secondary school qualification.
  20 12 years of primary and secondary schooling
  10  10 years of primary and secondary schooling
  0   Less than 10 years schooling

Age Sub-Factor
  30  18 to 29
  20  30 to 34
  10  35 to 39
  5   40 to 49
  0   Less than 18; more than 50

INDEPENDENT ENTRY VISA CLASS ONLY	

Language Sub-Factor
  20  Proficient in English
  10  Reasonably proficient; some training required
  5   Bilingual in languages other than English, or only limited English
  0   Extensive English training required

CONCESSIONAL FAMILY VISA CLASS ONLY

Relationship factor
  15  You are the parent of your sponsor
  10  You are brother, sister, or non-dependent child of sponsor
  5   Nephew or niece of sponsor

Citizenship factor
  10  Your sponsor has been an Oz citizen for 5 years or more
  5   				"       for less than 5 years

Settlement Factor
  10  Sponsor has been resident in Oz for 2 years and they or their 
        spouse have been continuously employed for the last two years.

Location Factor
5  Sponsor has lived in a State or Territory designated area for the last two
years.

Okay, tally up the points, and if you have a high enough total, you're
Oz-bound!  The point total changes each year, but I think it goes
		120  Priority Mark
		110  Pass Mark
		100  Pool Entry

NB: the number of points required for entry to the pool is the same no
matter what country you come from. [JM]

([SK] For Independent application you have to reach min. 110 pts.  For
concessional family application (with relatives that sponsor you,
other than spouse) you have to reach 100 points.  After that you have
to take an English test (for non-english speaking people) at the
moment it's the IELTS test. If you don't have enough marks at the
test, you will have to pay the "English Education Charge", about 4000
AUS$!!)

In the last category, you are placed within an entry pool, and I think
winners are chosen by lot from the pool.  Note that there is also a
Business Entry Class, for folks who are going Down Under to start
their own business.  There is also an entirely different system
whereby you bypass the points test and the wait if you somehow manage
to get a job, and your employer will vouch for you.

3.4.3 Spouse/fiance(e) immigration [LS]

[To make things simpler, 'you' will refer to the person in the United
States, and 'spouse' will refer to the person in Australia.]

* Once you have applied for permanent residence in Australia, you may
not reenter Australia until your new visa has been issued.  The
process is handled in stages.  The total time for obtaining your new
status will usually take three to six months.

* The spouse must go the Australian emigration officials and get a
copy of Form M40.  He/she should complete that and send it and a
certified copy of his/her birth certificate (assuming Australian
birth) to you.

* Locate your nearest Australian embassy to get the forms you will
need for the first stage of the process.  The application processing
fee is $285 (US) which must be in the form of a certified check or
money order. You need to file the following documents: your spouse's
completed sponsorship form and certified birth certificate, a
certified criminal record clearance for yourself (from your local
police), a certified copy of your birth certificate, a notarized
outline of the chronology of your relationship, 3 passport photos, a
certified copy of your divorce decree (only if you have been married
before, obviously), a form they call 'personal particulars', your
passport, and either a letter from a marriage celebrant of your
intention to marry or a certified copy of your marriage certificate.
Return all of this paperwork to the Australian embassy.

* After this initial paperwork has been approved by the immigration
officer, you will receive the forms for your physical.  When you have
your physical, ask the doctor for a detailed report of *anything* that
isn't absolutely "normal", including things you may consider
unimportant like allergies.  Basically if there is anything at all on
your forms that could be considered any sort of medical "condition"
ask for a separate letter describing what medical treatment or
followup is necessary (if none, make sure the doctor states this).
This forms should then be returned to the immigration office at your
local Australian embassy.

* While it appears to make no difference to immigration officials
whether you are married or engaged to be married, if you are engaged,
you will have to be married within 2 or 3 months (the answers given on
this varied) of your arrival in Australia.

3.5 Emigrants

[The following needs to be confirmed. AN]

If you have lived in Australia for more than 2 out of the last 3
years, you are eligible for a return visa, so that you are able to
come back to Australia after you left for overseas. The visum is
granted to permanent residents, and is valid for 5 years.

If later on you come back to Australia and live there for 2 years, you
are eligible for another 5-year extension. (1-year extension after 1
year).

4.COMING TO AUSTRALIA

4.1 Quarantine

Quarantine regulations are extremely strict.  Food, furs, and any
other animal or wood products may have to be quarantined.  Pets will
have to be quarantined for several months in both countries, an
expensive procedure.

* Bringing Pets into Australia from the USA [LS]

As of July, 1993, all pets coming into Australia from the United
States must be quarantined for a total of 9 months.  Pets will be
held in quarantine in special facilities for four months in Hawaii.
They will then be kept in a regular kennel for an additional month
before being allowed to enter Australia.  Once they have entered
Australia, they will be kept in one of four approved quarrantine
stations for 4 additional months.  During the stay in Australia, you
will be allowed to visit the pet once a month.  However, these rules
are currently being revised, and it is expected that the following
rules will be applicable before the year's end:

Pets may be flown directly from anyplace in the United States to one
of the four approved quarrantined stations.  The pet will be held in
quarrantine for 4 months.  During that time, you will be allowed to
visit the pet once a week.  Please note that the new rules have *not*
been finalised and are subject to change or may never even come into
effect.

Whatever rules are in effect, you will be expected to pay for the
upkeep of your pet during this entire time.

[ST May '94] We are sending over our two cats to Melbourne next month.
There are new rules coming into force in the coming week which permit
direct importation >from Canada (I don't know about the US, but
presume it will be the same) of cats and dogs. There is a 120 day
quarantine requirement followed by rabies antibody tests (like the old
rules). However, only the Sydney and Melbourne quarantine stations can
be currently used for this type of importation. The others can only be
used if the pet has been quarantined for 4 months plus 1 month
residency in Hawaii.  Details are available directly from the
Australian Quarantine Service in ACT. The Vancouver consulate was
unaware of these changes.


[JB Sept. 12, 1994]
New documentation from Melbourne indicates anyone wishing to import 
domestic animals into Australia must apply for a permit directly from the 
Dept. of Quarrenteen in the City in which you plan to live. They will 
send you a permit application ($43USA to apply for permit), approx. 2 
weeks later, which gives specific information regarding animal health 
requirements (ie:vaccinations and specific tests), transportion 
requirements (cage size etc.) and costs of the 120 day quaranteen. As of 
this date, a dog under 10 lbs costs $20USA per day. This fee increases as 
the  weight of the animal increases. Two animals may be kept in the same 
cage, but the cost is the same. A fee is charges to transport the animal 
from the airport to the quaranteen area (A$95), and for an exam upon 
arrival (A$45). Total cost to bring your dog along, if you decide to 
migrate to Australia $2,300 US dollars! 

4.2 Standards

* language: The national language of Australia is English.

* TV/VCR: Our TV/video system is PAL-B.  Multisystem videos (view NTSC
on a PAL TV) cost around $700.  Standards converters (output a
recordable signal NTSC from PAL, or vice versa) cost much more.  The
difference between PAL-B and PAL-D? [DH] According to the World Radio
TV Handbook, Australia uses PAL-B, not PAL-D.  The difference?  About
a MHz...  The technical differences (B vs. D) are:

	Channel width:	7 MHz vs. 8 MHz
	Vision b/w:	5 MHz vs. 6 MHz
	IF:		5.5 MHz vs. 6.5 MHz.


[PO] Australia uses the PAL video systema and the PAL-D television transmission 
system (D - stands for Delay Line).  Tapes which are recorded in PAL are fully 
compatible with the Aussie system.

Tapes which are recorded in NTSC are incompatible.  They can however be played 
on NTSC playback VCRs.  The older NTSC ( > 1year ) playback VCRs required the 
use of either an NTSC (or multi-format) TV or NTSC colour video monitor 
because the signals were not converted to PAL format.  VCRs available now with 
NTSC playback capabilities convert the NTSC signal into PAL so the 
signal can be displayed directly on PAL TVs or PAL colour monitors.

Don't try to use PAL equipment (TV/VCR etc) built for other countries in 
Australia because generally, the channels are different (eg UK only uses UHF 
but VHF is still used extensively here).  Also the sound is modulated into the 
signal at a different position relative to the video signal than to some other 
countries and so you may get a picture but no sound or vice-versa.

* Electricity: The electricity supply is 50Hz, 240 volts everywhere
(no longer 253 volts in W.A.).  Step-down transformers are available
(but wasteful),and the 50 Hz may throw off your clock-radio and other
things using the mains as a frequency reference.  AM broadcast
stations use 9 kHz spacing, in common with mostof the civilised world.
Your fancy USA radio with its 10 kHz spacing won't like this.  FM
broadcast stations use 50 micro-second pre-emphasis; USA uses 75 usec,
so the recovered audio may sound funny. [DH]

[JL] Power outlets have two slanting slots (hot and neutral, somebody else
will have to tell you which is which!) and a third vertical ground
slot. The configuration looks something like this...

		 /   \	<--- active and neutral pins
		/     \

		   |	<--- ground pin
		   |

BTW all three slots are identical in size, but the configuration
prevents the plug from being inserted incorrectly.

* Appliances and Transformers 

[LS]: Although many people have warned about the differences in
electricity between the two countries (Aus and USA), people who have
purchased step-down transformers have reported no problems with small
appliances such as mixers and coffee pots.  Also, appliances that will
convert from 120 to 240 will need adapators for Australian outlets.
It has been advised that you should buy these items while you are
still in the States.

[PR] In the USA, Magnetek (1 800 624 6384) transformers are: n-259mg
1000 Watt weighing 35lb, or n-257mg 500 Watt, 23lb.  $71 with a U.S.
power-cord which you can either adapt or cut off and replace
(trivial).  My take was that it was worth it for the stereo but not
much else.

[DH] Don't think it will matter where you buy it.  It is low tech, no
real cost advantage by getting it here.  As for the power rating, the
bigger the better, the more you can plug in at once (And the more
"Safe" overhead you will have) If you are concerned about weight to
ship things home, buy it in Oz.  They are a dime a dozen and available
anywhere.

[EG] First the basics.  In Canada and the U.S., power is approx. 120V,
60 Hertz.  In Australia it is 240V, 50 Hertz.  Very few appliances
depend on the line frequency (50Hz vs. 60Hz).  An exception is that
some clocks use the line frequency for timing.  I've also heard that
certain things like tape players or VCRs could potentially use the
line frequency for timing.  I brought a General Electric VCR with me
from the U.S. and it runs just fine on 50Hz.

Because just about everything runs okay on 50Hz, what people are
looking for is a device that transforms 240V 50Hz to 120V 50Hz.  I've
seen people naively say that they want something that converts 240V
50Hz to 120V 60Hz.  Such devices, which convert frequency as well as
voltage, are not necessary for most people and are extremely costly.
A simple voltage converter is all that most people need.

A crucial issue is the wattage of the converter.  Basically, this
specifies the maximum wattage that the converter can handle at any one
time.  So if you're going to run a bunch of appliances off of one
converter, you should first figure out the maximum wattage that each
may draw and add these up.  Usually appliances will have a label that
specifies maximum power usage.

One problem is that different manufacturers seem to rate things
differently.  You can get a cheap converter at Radio Shack that is
supposedly rated at 50 watts.  But when you read the fine print it
says something like "not for continuous usage".  I asked the salesman
about this (a dangerous thing to do, I know) and he said it could
handle 25 watts of continuous use.  Make sure that the rating you get
is for continuous use.  Also, be aware that reputable U.S.
manufacturers are likely to be more conservative in their ratings than
cheap imports.  I bought a high-quality transformer from a U.S.
manufacturer (Stancor) that's rated at 150 watts (at constant use).  I
have another transformer (made in Taiwan) that is about the same size
and claims to handle 500 watts.

The next issue is whether the transformer is grounded or not.  I'm not
sure why, but most of the transformers I've seen are not grounded.
For safety reasons it is best to get a transformer that will ground
your 3-pin appliances.

An additional issue is whether the transformer is a normal transformer
(autotransformer) or an isolation transformer.  An isolation
transformer will provide a cleaner power source than an
autotransformer since there is no direct DC path for voltage spikes to
follow.  I've seen isolation transformers recommended for computer
equipment.  This isn't necessary but if you want the extra protection
an isolation transformer is better than an autotransformer.

The next question is: where can you buy a transformer?  That's a good
question.  When I knew I was going to move to Australia, I called
around to a bunch of local electronics stores and electrical supply
houses to try to find a good quality, grounded, isolation transformer.
I couldn't find one locally, but was able to get one by mail order
from Allied Electronics.  I bought a Stancor GISD-150 transformer
(GISD = Grounded Isolation Step-Down).  It is designed to convert 230V
to 115V, and hence will convert 240V to 120V.  The input to that
converter is a grounded 3-pin U.S. 230V plug, and the output is the
standard U.S. 3-pin jack, which I have a power strip plugged into.
Since Allied Electronics also had Australian power cords, I bought one
of those and got the necessary 230V jack (at Hechinger's) to add to
the end of the cord.  Alternatively, one could buy the necessary
Australian plug and replace the U.S. plug.  In any event, it cost me
$60 for the transformer and $10 for the Australian power cord.  I'm
not necessarily recommending this route for making an Australian
transformer (because I don't know of the alternatives), but this is
what I did and it has worked fine for me.

Incidentally, I did find other non-grounded transformers locally.
They were much less expensive...approximately $25 for seemingly
low-quality transformers rated at 150 watts.  Allied sells a whole
line of Stancor transformers, with a wide variety of wattage ratings
and a choice of grounded vs. non-grounded and isolation vs.
autotransformer.  They also have an 800 number (1 800 433 5700).

* Monitors

[DE] If you have a Macintosh 12" colour monitor it won't work on 240
volts in Australia unless you buy a transformer. All other Macintosh
monitors should be dual 110/240 volts, and you will only need to cut
the plug off and put an Australian plug back on. Check the back of
your monitor to see what the specifications are. You will need 50 Hz
as well as 240 volts.

* Telephone: The telephone system is strictly regulated, but has
recently undergone a change from a monopoly to some real competition.
There are currently two national land-line telecommunications
carriers: Telecom and Optus; and three national mobile telephone
carriers: Telecom, Optus and Vodaphone.  From 1997 onwards unlimited
competition will be permitted.  Austel is the Federal Government's
telecommunications regulatory body.

In the meantime, don't even _think_ about connecting your answering
machine etc to it; it must bear an appropriate "Austel" compliance
sticker.  Besides, the signalling conventions are different (two short
rings instead of one long ring as in USA etc).  Australia is slowly
converting to AXE telephone exchanges, offering various features via
DTMF.  Examples are Call-Waiting, Third-Party-Conference etc.  Local
calls attract a flat fee, irrespective of duration; there have been
proposals floated to introduce timed local calls, but so far the
Federal Government has not had the courage to introduce it.  "Free"
calls exist - they are 008 numbers (like USA 800 numbers).  The other
end of the spectrum also exists - don't call 0055 numbers unless you
like paying a timed fee to the service provider - in some cases (time
etc) free alternatives exist.  There are various "free" services, such
as Time (1194), News (1199) etc.  There are also numbers starting with
"13" - they offer the same number country-wide, and are routed to the
nearest service provider (courier companies, airlines etc).  Finally,
a mobile telephone service is accessed via the 015, 018 and 041
prefixes; it is costed at STD rates, but the actual split of
caller/callee paying varies.  One more thing - the emergency number is
000; don't abuse it - they know from where the call was placed,
however Caller-ID is not generally available.  Cordless telephones are
prohibited imports; they will be confiscated by Customs.  Not only are
they not Austel-approved, they are not DoTaC (Dept. of Transport and
Communications) approved either, and they may stomp all over some
frequency assigned to another service. [DH]

* Modems [summary of responses: AN]

It seems that dial tones are the same these days, so there is no
problem usually with modems working. The thing is (as with phone and
answering machines), are they Austel approved? The fine for plugging
something non-approved into the phone socket is $12,000 apparently!
You have to get an adapter plug for the phone cord (OR wall socket).
You also have to get yet another small power supply to feed you USR
modem 9 volts or 12 or whatever it wants.

[AJ] I have US Robotics Sportster modem I bought while in the US.  It
works fine (as will the other US Robotics modems).  For the Sportster
at least you can buy a replacement for the external mains transformer
here [AUS] for around $20 (I scavenged mine).

* Currency

The Australian currency is the Australian dollar. The change from
pounds and pence took place in 1966, with the following ditty used
[AW]:

In come the dollars, in come the cents
Out go the pounds and the shillings and the pence
So be prepared when the money starts to mix
On the fourteenth of february nineteen sixty six

Bob Menzies wanted to call the new currency the 'Royal'!  Apparently
although dollar is a widely used name and can cause confusion with the
greenback, it does have local (historical) relevance as it was the
name of the first locally produced currency. Another name put forward
was the 'Austral'.

The 1 and 2 cent coins have been removed from circulation, however are
still legal tender. Prices are rounded up or down to the nearest 5
cents (ie 82c -> 80c, 83c -> 85c), although plenty of the larger
retailers round down all the time.  All coins have Queen Elizabeth II
on the "heads" side. The image of the Queen used was updated (so that
she now looks old!) a few years ago.  Current coins, colour, shape
(round unless stated) and their "tails" side are:

5c: silver, echidna
10c: silver, lyrebird
20c: silver, platypus
50c: silver, 12 sided, coat of arms roo and emu holding shield of 
        6 state emblems (also commemorative alternatives). The 1966 50c
        was round.
$1: gold, 5 kangaroos, also many years had commemorative $1 coins 
$2: gold, bearded aboriginal man and southern cross

"silver" is copper nickle alloy.
"gold" is copper aluminium etc alloy.

Coins in order of size are: 5c, $2, 10c, $1, 20c, 50c.  The old $1 and
$2 notes were replaced by coins. The other notes are as follows:

new $5: Plastic film purple/grey.
 Queen Elizabeth + gum leaves/ view and plan of new parliament house in 
 Canberra.  Hollogram(me) of a gum flower over a clear bird in flight.

new $10 plastic film blue/green.
 Banjo Paterson, with picture of a horseman, and some of the words to 
 "The Man from Snowy River". Also the words "Waltzing Mathilda" in the top 
 right corner. Mary Gilmour, with picture of some oxen pulling a wagon.

* Exchange Rates: Exchange rate is roughly AUS$1 = .67 US cents, Y67,
$HK5.01, $S1.03, Ringgit 1.65, $NZ1.17, $Ca0.85, Pound 0.42, FF3.65,
DM1.05, SF0.91, ECU0.55

* The metric system is used.  Conversion to the metric system
officially began in 1971 and was officially completed in 1981.  It has
been remarkably successful, with even conversational use of metric
measures more the norm than the exception. (See more in Section 12.4 on
Australian language usage)

4.3 Cars

NB. Australians drive on the left.

Anyone can import a vehicle, but all privately imported vehicles
attract the same rate of Duty and Sales Tax as commercially imported
vehicles.  If not valued before importing, the Customs value will be
normally assessed on the purchase price. There are additions and
deductions available for this method.  If owned and used overseas then
depreciation is allowed on the purchase price.  Alternatively, the
likely local value of the vehicle can be used.  There is also a limit
of one car per person per year. (Note that these conditions only apply
federally, there are state variations).

Combined Duty and Sales Tax rates:
  Vehicles under 30 yrs old, new or used
Customs Value           Sales Tax & Duty
$1 - 19583              60%
$19584+                 84%
  As above, but older than 30yrs
$1 - 26437              18%
$26438+                 36%
  Off road 4wd passenger vehicles
$1 - 22989              44%
$22990+                 58%
Motorcycles             24%

The Motor Vehicle Standards Act, 1989 makes it illegal to import a
vehicle unless:
i) it meets the safety and emissions standards applying to vehicles to
   be used on Australian roads
ii) arrangements are in place to modify the vehicle to meet these
   requirements after its arrival.

Approval will be given to import a vehicle if :
i) It has a valid compliance plate fitted; or
ii) arrangements are in place for it to be modified to have a
    compliance plate fitted; or
iii) you have a letter of compliance from the manufacturer; or
iv) you have owned and used the vehicle overseas for a continuous
    period of not less than 3 months, you are of driving age and are an
    Australian citizen or migrant holding permanent residency; or
v) the vehicle was manufactured before 1 Jan, 1974 for cars or 1 Jul
   1975 for motorbikes.

If it brought in under points iii-v, it will get a personal import
plate, rather than a compliance plate. This is sufficient to allow it
to be sold.  Note that at least some states require left-hand drive
vehicles to be converted to right-hand drive, which is likely to be
expensive (and troublesome to drive in).

[JM] Cars are more expensive here than most countries, but the days
when it was worthwhile importing your own are gone.  In the lead up to
the last election, there was considerable discussion about how much
more expensive Australian cars are, and the worst figure I heard of
was around $4,000 more for an average family saloon.  In any case, you
have to pay customs duty if you import a car and it usually isn't
worthwhile.  Be aware however of two points regarding cars in
Australia:
- European cars are luxury items, more expensive than you might expect,
- second hand values are higher than you would expect (rust isn't a
  problem so the beasts stay on the road longer.)

4.3.1 Car Insurance 

[JC] Be aware that insurance history is *personal* rather than per
policy in Australia. I had trouble with getting my Australian No Claim
bonus accepted in UK because I wanted to maintain the insurance policy
on my Australian car. A year ago when I wanted to start a policy on a
second car in Australia, my no claim bonus was accepted automatically.
I suggest you get a statement from your UK insurer stating not only
the level of no cliam bonus but also the period for which you have had
no claims, since the period that it takes to get to 60% varies.

Many Australian insurers will record but not penalise you for you 'no
fault' claims i.e. where you claim through your insurer to get repairs
done quickly and then the insurer recovers the cost of the repairs
through the insurer of the other party. E.g. Someone backed into me
while I was stationary.  I claimed through my insurer who recover the
money from the other party. My 'no claim' history was preserved.

Car insurance is somewhat differently organised between UK and
Australia.  (All?) States require you to obtain 'Compulsory Third
Party' (CTP) before registration, but this is only Third Party Injury
insurance.  You can then take out a separate Third Party Property
policy (a 'bomb' policy for your car (UK: banger) which is not worth
insuring), or Comprehensive Insurance. I have never heard of Third Part
Fire and Theft in Australia.

4.4 Shipping Information

* From USA to Australia [LS]

It would appear that the cheapest way to get books to Australia is by
using an M-bag from the US Postal Service (this service is for books
only).  The surface rate for this is $.72 per pound (this is the rate
from Washington, D.C., to Sydney).  Each M-bag can contain from 15-66
pounds and from the experience of netters, it takes about 8 weeks to
arrive.  One netter said that Australian postal carriers are not
allowed to handle packages over 20 kg (~44 lbs) so the bags are opened
when they reach Australia, and the packages inside are delivered.
Therefore, put an address on each separate package inside an M-bag.
An air M-bag is available for $5.96 (same origination/destination as
previous) per pound.

Whether or not to ship your belongings from the U.S. to Australia
appears to be a highly subjective matter.  However, most people seem
to believe it is well worth the effort and expense if you have quality
furniture.  What to bring with you varies wildly, too.  It all appears
to go back to something that each person feels is important.  The only
consistency: a lot of people were sorry that they had sold electrical
appliances.  With the use of a step-down transformer, most everything
(except tvs) will work just fine.

While you will want to get your own estimates, be prepared to spend in
the thousands of US dollars (the average price seemed to be around
$6,000).  The experiences people had ran the gamut--some had no
damages and some found crates with items just thrown into the boxes.
If you are using door-to-door movers and a container, insist that the
container be packed at *your* house to avoid breakage.  Which brings
up the issue of insurance.  Be very certain that you understand what
method of determining value is used.  One person had bought more than
enough insurance to cover the value of her goods.  However, the policy
paid on the percentage of the shipment weight lost, not on a
cost-to-replace basis.

[AN] Standard insurance I was offered was $25/1000 of the value I put
on my things. I decided to value for replacement cost.

There are three basic parts of a move from the States to Australia.
The first is the packing at your house and delivery to a port, the
second is overseas shipping, and the third is customs clearance and
shipping to the final destination in Australia.  It has been suggested
by many people that you insist on having a quote broken down into
those stages.  Almost everyone felt that you would be best served (and
save *lots* of cash) by working through a shipping agent to cover
these stages rather than using a moving company for door-to-door
service.  The possibility to do either exists, and there were a couple
of people who felt door-to-door service was the best way.

There are two basic types of containers for overseas shipping: ship's
containers and waterproofed crates.  Ship's containers come in two
sizes 40' and 20' and everyone agreed that you can fit an amazing
amount of stuff in a 20' container.  The waterproofed crates are for
smaller shipments where using a container is not cost effective.

It is very important to get an inventory of what goes into every box.
Do not pack any boxes yourself.  The moving company will mark all such
boxes as "packed by owner", and this may delay you in customs.

Moving from your house to the port is based on total weight; the costs
from the States to Australia are based on volume.  So, if you were
planning on taking heavy, small stuff or big, light stuff to save
money, forget it.  However, most people felt that the approximate
weight of an average container was used in figuring weight, and
unless, you went *way* over the average, you weren't charged more.

It will take your belongings at least three months to arrive and clear
customs.  Remember to use other means (you might want to talk to a
mover about a small air shipment) to ship the stuff you are going to
have to have in the interim like sheets.

* From USA to Australia [BJ]

Surface shipping is very expensive; but also quite "flexible."
Standard price LA->Oz is $450 a cubic metre.  (Yes, that is absurdly
expensive).  Of course, one place at a whim cut the price from $450 to
$250 a cubic metre.

In general excess baggae is the cheapest; both United and QANTAS
charge $90-$100 a bag.  Still, this is cheaper than surface shipping
*AND* you get your stuff straight away.  No waiting anything upto 2
months (maybe more).  I took six bags; 2 are standard, I was charged
$400 excess baggage for the 4 bags over the limit.  (I'd been living
in the States for quite a while).  I did read in the FAQ that
Australians returning home receive baggage credits (ie. who have been
residing overseas).  Not so.  It turns out Americans migrating to Oz
receive 2 baggage credits (ie. 4 free items).  That's QANTAS,
Australia's National airline (who apparently has a bit of an identity
crisis ;-)

The bags must be no more than 70 pounds each.  That's pretty heavy.
If you are shipping appliances be warned that box and pack places
charge $40 a box (these are cardboard boxes with foam peanuts).  For a
few bucks more you can get a suitcase, though obviously some things
HAVE to be boxed and packed.  If you have a computer etc keep the
original packaging and save yourself some money.  (My obsessive
compulsive roommate kindly threw my "tatty" boxes out without asking me
- Grrrrr)

If you have books and printed matter you can save a bundle sending
them bookpost.  That's 72 cents a pound; the boxes you use must be
small enough to fit in an "m-bag" (yes, you actually get to try and
stuff them into those big canvas mailbags).  They take 4-6 weeks (I've
yet to receive my first) but at 72 cents a pound they work out to be
approximately half the price of excess baggage.

Hints about packing/moving:
+ start early; its a hell of a lot of work.
+ you really will regret those "useless" things you leave behind.
+ It costs a lot; I spent $700 mooving my stuff - and I don't
   really have all that much.
+ Be prepared for many tears and anxiety attacks.
ie. MOVING SUCKS!

Customs: You get judged on the spot.  They won't guarantee how
much duty you will be charged in advanced.  Everything older than 12
months is duty free.  They may or may not charge you for personal
possessions less than 12 months old.  It comes down to the disgression
of the customs officer who examines your luggage.  If they think
you're importing stuff that you'll resell, you will get charged.
Generally, be polite and honest; declare everything, and if you're
smart you will have receipts handy.  Some inlaws of mine bought a fair
bit of stuff overseas and "forgot" about it; they got $2,000 in fines.

Duties (actually duty is both real duties (tarrifs) and sales tax;
mercifully the Oz government is finally starting to trim tarrifs).
All things electrical: 54%.  Computer Hardware: 21%.  Shoes and
Clothes (for personal use): 0%.  Computer Software: 0%.  (HEY! If
computer software is duty free then why does a game that costs US$45
(A$65) in the US cost A$150 in Australia?)

Actually that fits well with my next point; many things are much much
cheaper in the US.  Reeboks US$22-US$30.  Brand name jeans US$27-US$37
(eg. red tabs, other Levis).  I got a really good black leather jacket
for US$150.  Bitchin!  CDs US$13-17 first release.  Computer software
is cheap.  Consumer electronics are cheap.  Computer hardware is
between the same and cheaper depending on what youy are buying.  eg.
CDroms and ISA carsd are *MUCH* cheaper, but system units are pretty
much the same.  Even with the Australian dollar at 72cents there are
lots of bargains to be had over there!  If you're going to the US be
prepared for some heavy duty shopping!  The food is also excellent,
and once you get used to the concept (many Australians get the shivers
from it) tipping isn't that bad after all (at least for restaurants);
actually works out well for all the parties involved.  One last point;
LA does in fact have a public transport system; call 1-800-2LARIDE.
LA is by far the prettiest in the winter when there is no smog.  Lots
more to tell but that will do for now.

* From Australia to the UK

I have just moved to the UK and if you are sending a lot of books,
there is a *very* reasonable way using Aus. Post. They have this thing
called "Print Post" where you can send printed material (books, notes,
photos etc.)  for $2/kg. Parcels of books have to be divided into
groups with the weight of each group being between 6 and 16 kg (I
think, check with AP for the correct bracket) and you then get a post
bag (which weighs 1kg) to put the parcels in. The whole bag with
contents is then weighed to determin the price. This is a fifth of the
cost of the cheapest freight I could find and is post-office to
address rather than dock to dock. The delivery time to the UK is about
8 weeks, I imagine it would be similar for the US.  Even if you are
only sending 10kg of books, this is a considerable saving on sending
it via normal freight channels. [DF]

* From Edinburgh to Oz [LC]

Here's a summary of a couple of replies I received to my query
regarding shipping household goods back to Oz from the UK;
specifically from Edinburgh.  The main recommendation was to go with a
large reputably company rather than a smaller, perhaps cheaper, one.
Using the latter may involve lengthy delays, with boxes sitting in
warehouses for anything up to months at a time. Having a local office
at either end is also very useful. In Edinburgh, this narrows the
choice to Pickfords or Scotpac. (There's lots of shipping companies
based in London advertised in the London TNT mag. for Aus/NZers, but I
have no idea on how recommendable they are.) I was warned off the
former, with tales of delay and damage, while Scotpac were reported to
have involved no delays (about 3 months transit time) and no damage
(apart from a buckled bike wheel: lesson is to obtain a bike carton
from a bike shop; actually, shipping bikes is quite expensive, and we
hope to use ours as the second piece of checked-in luggage if flying
via the US).

As far as the choice between door-to-port and door-to-door goes, one
person strongly recommended the latter as saving lots of hassle,
although he did have his moving expenses paid for!! The others
reported no hassles with pickups from Sydney depots, with no extra
charges involved; one had her stuff shipped from Sydney to Armidale
(arranged in Oz) for a *lot* less than the extra it would have cost
for door-to-door.

* Airlines

It has been said that some airlines will allow persons with permanent
residence visa to enter the Australia with additional baggage at no
extra charge.  United Airlines does not allow this.  United allows two
checked bags and charges $100 for each additional bag (bags may not
weigh more than 70 pounds).  It has been said that Quantas will honor
the additional baggage deal, but this has not been confirmed. [LS] If
you are a U.S. government employee, the government will give you
additional baggage credits; make sure you check into this.

[AN] For US to Australia, going to Brisbane, Sydney or Cairns, Qantas
charge US$92 for each excess bag weighing less than 70lb, US$92x2 for
each bag between 70 and 100lb, and more for bags over 100lb. The woman
I spoke to said that would be the same for going on to Melbourne.


[ST] Regarding baggage allowance for permanent residence visa holders on
airlines. The rule is that you must have a one-way ticket and the visa has
not yet been activated. Baggage allowance is doubled (4 bags instead of
2), not unlimited, and is known as the "migrant's allowance". My wife got
it when she came to Canada as landed immigrant. I was offered it now we
are going over to Australia, but could not as I was getting a return
ticket. I don't think it is universally accepted except by the destination
country's airline.

4.5 Miscellaneous

If your children are in Scouts get international transfer papers from
the local council.  Otherwise, they might not be able to get into a
troop.  Cub Scouts did not start until boys were 8 -- a bit different
than here in the US.

5.STUDYING IN AUSTRALIA

5.1 Overview of Australian Higher Education [CP,April '93]

A few general points: the academic year in Australian universities
usually runs from about March 1 to November 1 with an examination term
in November. Applications for undergraduate programs are usually made
through a centralised organisation in each state.  International
students wishing to study in Australia should check with the nearest
Australian embassy on where and when to send their applications.
Offers of places are usually made in late January and early February.
The costs of attending Australian Universities include the Higher
Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) charge (Graduate tax) and a
student services fee.  The student services fees vary from university
to university (at major universities its around $300 +/- $75) but the
HECS contribution (about $2300/year) is set by the federal government
and is the same for all universities. Payment of the HECS contribution
can be deferred until after graduation, however if its paid up front
there is a discount of 15%, otherwise it is repaid as a surcharge on
individual income tax. Nominally it should cost you the same (for
tuition/HECS) to get a B.Sc. in Brisbane as in Perth.

Foreign students are not subject to the HECS but instead are subject
to an annual tuition fee (the equivalent of out-of-state tuition in
the US) charged by the university [JB], half of which has to be paid
before a visa is granted (note that students in exchange programs may
be exempt from this fee). The fee varies with the university and the
degree program and is on the order of A$10-15,000 p.a. depending on
degree program (Medical, dental and veterinary programs are more:
A$20-25,000 p.a.)  Foreign students are also required to purchase
private health insurance, which currently costs ~$350 p.a.  Foreign
students are permitted to take part time employment up to 20 hours per
week during the semester and full time during vacations.

Degree programs in Australian universities show greater similarity to
British degree programs than to American ones.  Thus, even before they
start an undergraduate degree, Australian students have to choose what
general field they wish to get their degree in. In addition to science
(B.Sc.), arts and humanities (B.A.), commerce (B.Comm.) and
engineering (B.E.), these fields include professional training which
is usually only available at the graduate level in the US (e.g. Law,
Medicine, Dentistry, Veterinary Science).  As a general rule there are
no "breadth" requirements, indeed science students may not be able to
take more than 1 or 2 arts courses (liberal arts and humanities) and
vice versa. In general, ordinary degrees in arts (B.A.), science
(B.Sc.), and commerce (B.Comm.)  require 3 years of full time study.
Honours degrees in these areas usually require an extra years study
and the preparation of a small thesis. An honours degree is normally
required for admission to graduate study.  Students without an honours
degree may be required to complete a "masters preliminary year" before
being admitted to graduate programs (masters programs in
administration seem to be an exception). In the case of degree
programs which are normally four years (e.g.agriculture, forestry,
engineering) an honours degree is obtained by completing extra work
and receiving high grades in core classes.

While Australian universities do participate in local and intervarsity
sporting competitions such competition is pretty low key and there is
nothing like the big-bucks semi-professional athletic programs one
sees in the US. Athletic scholarships are unheard of.

In general, Australian universities are commuter universities.  The
vast majority of undergraduates live at home while doing their
degrees, although many share housing in suburbs close to their
university or live in residence halls or residential colleges.
Students tend not to go interstate for undergraduate study, and even
at the graduate level their is very little incentive to relocate to
another city or even another university: most do their graduate work
at the same institution they did their undergraduate work at.

5.2 Postgraduate Study [CP]

I don't know how universal my experience was (I did a MSc in
biochemistry) but my experience was that people admitted into MSc or
PhD programs in Australia were admitted to work with a specific
supervisor, i.e. the decision to take on a particular person as a grad
student rested with the specific supervisor that the student wanted to
work with. This is very different from the situation in the US where
students are usually admitted to a department and spend a year or two
taking classes and finding a supervisor/advisor to work with. In
general, Australian PhD programs don't involve any course work. Partly
because of this their "usual" duration is about 3 years and their
maximum duration is usually 4 years (cf 5 and 8 years in the US!!!!).

Another thing which is different between graduate programs in the two
countries is the way students are supported. In Australia most of the
scholarship support for graduate students comes directly from the
federal government, foreigners are not eligible for these
scholarships. Some postgraduate scholarships are offered by the
universities themselves and by charitable research foundations (eg
National Heart Foundation), these are the only ones that foreigners
are eligible for!!! In the US most graduate student support is
channeled through the universities.  There are a few federally funded
fellowships that are similar to the old CPRA's, but only a VERY few!
Most of the students in the sciences get their stipends from their
supervisor's research grants, or from federal training grants
administered by the institutions.  Alternatively they may serve as
teaching assistants (the main source of funds for humanities grad
students).

5.3 Miscellaneous Questions

[NB: most ITs and CAEs have now been merged with or converted into
universities.)  [JB]

Q. Can I assume that a degree from a UC, IT or CAE carries just as
much weight as a degree from a University?  
A. (1) To be frank, no, but the difference is a lot less than it is
between various universities in the US. The main quality difference is
in the undergraduate degrees; an EE degree from Monash is very
theoretical, whereas one from RMIT is more practical. This is not to
say one is "better"; some employers prefer one approach, others the
other.
(2) A PhD from anywhere in Australia is equally-regarded.  
(3) [RA] adds: I wouldn't be so sure.  For people looking for academic
employment, I suspect that in most disciplines, certain supervisors
and/or departments are a lot more highly regarded than others.  I
imagine the same thing applies for Ph.D.s looking for jobs outside
academia, as well.  This is really very similar to the U.S.--except
for a very few institutions there, which are in the lucky position of
being highly prestigious in most fields, the quality and saleability
of a Ph.D. depends more on the department and/or supervisor than on
the institution.  This is something that anyone contemplating a Ph.D.
should think about carefully, though, as it is a hell of a lot of time
to invest if you aren't going to get a good degree.

Q. Is there an accrediting agency for MBA programmes (in the U.S.,
business schools are accredited by a nation-wide body called AASCB).
Should I even be looking for a parallel?
A. No. Each state accredits the universities and degrees, then the
Federal Govt (which funds them) keeps an eye on things.  Australia
really does not suffer from the shonky mailing_box_university problem
that exists in the US.

Q.  Is there higher prestige attached to certain Aussie MBA
programmes?  (If this concept has no place in Aussie culture, I
apologise. I have only experienced the U.S. educational system.  I,
therefore, constantly try to find a parallel. Here in the U.S.,
degrees from certain schools are very highly regarded ...  like
Stanford, Harvard, Univ. Chicago ...)
A. Same here. The two highest-rated in Australia are the Australian
Graduate School of Management at the University of NSW, and the
University of Melbourne Graduate School of Management. The others are
of varying quality, but all quite good by world standards.

* Which universities have the most overseas students?

which reviewed Australian Universities.  Listed below are the 'top 10'
Australian Uni's in terms of percentage of overseas students.

5.4 "Classification" of Australian Universities 

I thought that it might be more useful for those unfamiliar with the
Australian Higher Education Scene to try and classify the institutions
according to their history and aims in life.  I have tried to keep my
personal biases out of the short descriptions, but they will no doubt
show through.  I have also probably left a couple of the smaller
institutions off the list - with the rate of amalgamations and
institutional divorces, it is hard to keep track off all of them (for
example there may now be a University of Northern Rivers, which
resulted from U.N.E. breaking up).  The order of the classes is NOT
meant to indicate any ranking of the universities.  A very good source
of information about these institutions is the essay in the
Commonwealth Universities Handbook, which unfortunately I don't have
handy to check on all my details!  Let me then apologise to anyone I
have left out or misrepresented in the list below.

To give you some idea of sizes,	the largest Australian universities,
(Sydney, Melbourne, Queensland, New South Wales, Monash) have 20,000+
students. Government policy makes it undesirable for institutions to
have less than 5,000 students.

Ian (iand@hydra.maths.unsw.edu.au)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Class 1.  The large old institutions in the big cities.  I think all
founded pre WWI, these institutions offer a full range of courses at
both undergraduate and postgraduate level, including medical and legal
degrees, and large research programs.  Whether deserved or otherwise,
these universities still carry more prestige than others in their
state.

* Sydney, Melbourne, Queensland, Adelaide, Western Australia.

Class 1a.  Old, like class 1, but in a much smaller city, somewhat
limiting its development.

* Tasmania
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Class 2.  Large post WWII universities.  Originally looked down on a
little (although the standards weren't questioned [JB]) these
institutions are now very similar to those of class 1.  With those of
class 1, these institutions take the lion's share of government
research money and the good students.

* New South Wales, Monash

Class 2a.  The Australian National University was set up after WWII to
offer more postgraduate education in Australia (while many
universities had PhDs, they were nothing like as popular as they are
now [JB]).  Although it now teaches undergraduates as well, it is
still the home of the Institute for Advanced Study, which is devoted
to postgraduate education and research. It's range of courses is more
limited than those of U.N.S.W. and Monash.

* A.N.U.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Class 3.  1960s-1970s suburban universities.  These were set up to
cater for the rapid expansion in higher education in Australia that
took place at this time.  As befitted the period, they were often set
up with unconventional academic structures (stressing
multidisciplinary courses for example), and with some programs not
offered elsewhere. Designed to be teaching and research institutions,
their full development is perhaps hampered by the difficulty they have
in attracting very good students away from the universities in classes
1 and 2.

* Macquarie, La Trobe, Flinders, Griffith, Murdoch

Class 3a. Regional universities of about the same age.  Usually
beginning as sponsored colleges of one of the institutions from
classes 1 or 2. Perhaps more conventional than those in class 3, but
otherwise having similar strengths and weaknesses, and broadly
comparable on the prestige scales.

* Newcastle, Wollongong, New England, James Cook, Deakin (Deakin was a
bit different, in that it was a CAE (Gordon IT) which was converted
[JB]).
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Class 4.  Institutes of Technology.  Although most of these
institutions have now changed their names to "university", they began
by offering undergraduate education of a more applied nature than the
traditional universities.  They gradually developed postgraduate
courses and research programs to a sufficient extent that the
distinction (in particular with respect to research funding) between
these institutions and the "lesser" universities was difficult to
sustain.  Although these are now rather large and broad institutions,
they are still somewhat different in their aims to those of classes 1,
2 and 3.

* Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, University of Technology
  Sydney (was N.S.W.I.T.), Curtin University of Technology (W.A.I.T),
  University of South Australia (S.A.I.T.), Queensland University of
  Technology (Q.I.T. and BCAE) Victoria University of Technology 
  (was Footscray I.T.), Swinburne University of Technology (was 
  Swinburne I of T) 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Class 5.  Former Colleges of Advanced Education.  Originally set up as
undergraduate institutions, offering a limited range of courses, such
as teacher training, nursing, accounting etc.  In the Dawkins era
(mid-late 1980s), these were "encouraged" to band together to form
larger (but often quite geographically dispersed) institutions, so
that they could get a bigger share of the funding pie.  Despite their
change of status, they are probably destined to remain as essentially
undergraduate teaching institutions for the forseeable future.

* Edith Cowan, Charles Sturt, Western Sydney, Canberra, Southern
  Queensland, Central Queensland, Ballarat University College, Northern
  Territory (perhaps misplaced here...it's geographical position makes it
  a bit of a special case).
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Class 6.  Private Universities and Universities with Religious
Affiliations.  During the late 1980's private universities made their
first appearance (all the above institutions are government funded).
The loudest of these in announcing its arrival was Bond University, in
Queensland.  There still seems to be a degree of resistance to private
institutions in Australia - it is too early to tell how successful
they will be.  Mainly funding considerations dictate that these
universities offer only a limited range of courses.

* Bond, Notre Dame, Australian Catholic University (although perhaps
  this belongs in class 5)

5.5 Academic Addresses

* "The Directory" (6 months=$90 airmail, fortnightly) advertises many
academic jobs.

* Clayton and Partners. Also 275 Alfred St. North Sydney.
	Phone: 62,1,959-3448
	Contact: David Burgess, Brian Clayton.
	Comment: Slightly larger, but not big enough to be impersonal. 
		Proffesional.Efficient. Have found me a few jobs over
		the years, some I've taken, some not. Do have a habit
		of finding you a job, settling you in, waiting 6
		months then ringing up to see if you wan't another
		job.  Generally, an impressive agency.

At present there are very few university administrators using the net.
You're unlikely to have much success in trying to contact university
registrars and vice-chancellors by email! You're much better of
sending a letter by regular mail. Remember to pay for airmail postage
if sending the letter from outside Australia!!!!  Also remember that
letters sent between mid-December and mid-February are likely to get
fairly slow responses.

If you're trying to find an email address for a student please realise
that net access is still fairly restricted in Australia and the great
majority of students do NOT have net access. This situation is
changing slowly, but at present those who are most likely to have net
access are in the sciences (particularly maths, physics, and computer
science) and engineering.

6.FOR AUSTRALIANS OVERSEAS

6.1 Radio Australia (update)

Up-to-date information on frequencies can be found on rec.radio.shortwave, 
or ftp from nic.funet.fi:/pub/dx/text/schedules/Oceania/australia.prog.txt.

These frequencies are for August 1992:

  21740 - 0100 to 0400 GMT
  17795 - 0100 to 0400  "
  15240 - 0300 to 0500  "
  13605 - 1600 to 1800  "
   9580 - 0830 to 1500  "
  11800 - 

On the east coast of the USA, I can Radio Australia on 9580 Hz and
11800 in the morning. In the spring and summer I can get RA on 15240
late at night when they are doing sporting broadcasts.  I can also get
15365 during the evening. Radio Australia comes in better in spring
and summer in North America, than in autumn and winter, especially for
the higher frequencies, due to differences in the ionosphere.  [AN]

Sports Broadcasts [JM]: Radio Australia broadcasts the Saturday sports
program called `Grandstand' on Saturday afternoons. The broadcasts are
primarily aimed at Asia and the Pacific but the transmissions can be
received all over the world.  Grandstand is broadcast between 0200 and
0730 UT (= 1200 and 1730 AEST) on Saturdays for AFL football and 0300
and 0730 UT (=1300 and 1730 AEST) on Sundays for Rugby League. Updates
of the Sunday AFL match scores are available during the Rugby League
broadcasts.

 The frequencies published for Radio Australia broadcasts are:

  Pacific          - 17795 kHz, 15240 kHz, 11720 kHz
  Papua New Guinea - 11880 kHz
  South Asia       - 21595 kHz
  South East Asia  - 17715 kHz

 For other areas during these times, try these frequencies:

  Japan                 - 17715 kHz
  Middle East/NE Africa - 21595 kHz
  UK/Europe             - 21595 kHz
  USA/Canada            - 17860 kHz, 17795 kHz, 15365 kHz, 11910 kHz, 9860 kHz,
                           9580 kHz

calendars, posters), a range of Women'sWeekly Cookbooks, tapes of

Imports for $2.19 for a small jar (115g). [GV]

* Tasmanian Aborigines and Trugannini

The "tradition" view [AD]:

The last hundred survivors of the Tasmanian aborigines were
rounded up in an operation known as the "black line" about the
1850s.  They were all moved to a settlement on Flinders Island at
a place called Wybalenna.  They were forced to adopt "christian"
society clothing/behaviour..  They gradually died out fron the
european diseases until, when there were only about 30 left they
were moved to Oyster Cove in southern Tasmania.  They gradually
died out.

The last male survivor was William Lanney.  He was murdered
during a boat trip across a river.  He was thrown from the boat
and his hands cut off as he tried to return to the boat.  After
he was buried grave robbers removed his head to sell to British
Scientists.

The last female survivor was Trucaninni (or Truganinni) who was
also known as Lallah Rookh.  She died in about 1878.  There are
unconfirmed reports of two elderly ladies living on Kangaroo
Island (i think) South Australia until about the 1890s.

There are NO full blood aborigines alive today.  A fair few
aborigines live on Cape Barren Island, just south of Flinders
Island (in Bass strait between Tasmania and Victoria).  Racisim
on the islands is rife IMHO.

White sealers often stole aboriginal women for their sex slaves,
and half-castes were generally descended from these situations.
The women were known as " gins" and were roughly treated.

An interesting facet of this story is that in 1984, the Tasmanian
Museum discovered an Edison Cylindrical Phonograph record in it's
coffers which had recordings of a half-caste lady (who claimed
she was full blooded).  She was singing traditional aboriginal
songs.  The recording was made in 1902.  A very stirring feeling
listening to this 90 year old recording of a vanished culture and
it makes me feel very ashamed to be a white Tasmanian.

[XXX Can someone write a paragraph about how there really
are Tasmanian aboriginals left? AN]

7.4 Political History

7.4.1 History of Australian "Independence" 

* Outline [ZS]

1-Jan-1901 - Federation: After many years of debate the six British
colonies have finally agreed to unite, and on this date become a
federation of six states under an Act of the British parliament.  In
many respects the new federation is an independent country.  It has
its own constitution, its own parliament and is responsible for its
own laws, police, defence, currency, immigration and so on.  However,
legal, economic and social ties to Britain remain very strong.  The
British monarchy has a formal role in the Australian government.  Some
court cases can be appealed to British courts.  Furthermore, at least
in theory, Britain could overrule Australian laws or even change the
constitution.  As a practical matter, Australians see themselves as a
loyal part of the British Empire. [RS]

1931 - The UK passes the Statute of Westminster act.  This grants
independence to Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and South Africa; it also
authorises the Australian Parliament to declare independence whenever
it feels like it.  However, the Australian States are specifically
excluded from the act.

3-Sep-1939 - WWII breaks out; nothing directly significant to
independence happens, but this date will become significant later.

1942 - Australia passes the Statute of Westminster Acceptance Act,
thus declaring independence; the Act is backdated to 3-Sep-1939.
However, as mentioned before, the States remained colonies.  From
3-Sep-1939, the Commonwealth of Australia is an independent country
made up of a federation of six British colonies!  The UK no longer has
the power to make laws, give orders, or in any other way interfere
with the Commonwealth of Australia; but it can, and occasionally does,
interfere with the States.

1986 - Australia, the UK, and all six States pass the Australia Act,
and the Queen comes out here to sign it.  Among other things, this act
finally grants independence to the States.

1992. The Australian Republican Movement is launched as a
"non-political" organisation.  (See Section 8.5 below).

* Comments [JB]

I think that Zev was just a teensy bit sweeping in describing the
new Commonwealth as a colony. While its status fell a long way short
of the independance we "enjoy" today, it was in no ways the same as a
common or garden colony.  Let me gives some examples.

During WWI the British army passed a routine request to the Aus,
Canadian, NZ, SA, etc. governments that their troops be dealt with
under the usual military law. While all the other Dominions agreed,
Australia refused (memories of Morant, etc. being still rather
bitter). The Brits muttered, complained, but could not override.
Consequently although New Zealanders and Canadians are among the 500
odd troops shot for "cowardice" in France, there are no Australians. I
do not think this was the outcome we would have seen if Australia had
just been a colony.

When Queensland "colonized" Papua in 189x(?), the Poms kicked up a
stink and took it (reluctantly) for themselves, saying that colonies
could not have colonies of their own (unlike fleas.) Papua was handed
to Australia in 1906, so in that respect, at least, the Commonwealth
was not regarded as a colony.

The battle by Hughes, et al. for separate representation at Versailles
was also an interesting commentary on attitudes to colonies. While the
UK obviously did not regard us as a colony, they *did* regard as as
being part of their Empire. So did the Yanks, and in fact Wilson was
quite opposed to separate representation.

All these points are a bit subtle though, and I think Zev's original
statement is closer to the truth than the usual guff about us becoming
a "new nation" at federation. I also agree that our *real*
independance began in 1986, although I don't think it will be absolute
until we are rid of the monarchy, the Act of Settlement, etc. etc.

7.4.2 Aboriginal Voting [JM]

* 1900	 

The original constitution *guarantees* the Federal vote to anyone
who has it at State level (refer Section 41).  Because
aboriginals had the vote in all states except Queensland and
Western Australia, they were able to vote in Federal elections in
those states (and have always been able to do so.)

There was also no *specific* exclusion of aboriginals from voting
at Federal Elections in Queensland and WA, and some actually did.
The major hurdle, however, was that state officials maintained
both state and federal rolls and in most cases illegally blocked
attempts by aboriginals in those states to enroll for Federal
elections.  

The effect of section 30 (to which you refer) is to ensure that
those aboriginals who *did* have the vote, also got counted when
determining the size of electorates thereby skirting the
provision of section 127 which said they weren't to be counted.
(Confused? Well, so am I, but they spent 10 years in the 1890's
writing this thing.)
	 
* 1918	 

In 1918, the Electoral Act formalised voting procedures for
Federal elections.  This however was a setback for aboriginals in
Queensland and WA because it contained provisions that brought
State and Federal rolls into line.  This meant they could *not*
vote in Federal Elections unless they also had the vote in State
elections.

Another apparently innocent provision of the Electoral Act was
used for many years in the Northern Territory to deny the vote to
large numbers of aboriginals.  Although aborigines were compelled
to enroll like all other voters, local officials often had them
declared wards of the state.  Wards of the state were prohibited
from voting at that time, possibly because wards were usually the
mentally ill.

* 1948	 

UN Declaration on Human Rights passed and ratified by Australia in
1949.  At this point, the Federal Government had perfect moral grounds
for reenfranchising aborigines in WA and QLD, but failed to do so.

* 1957     

ILO Convention on the Rights of Indigenous People passed and ratified
by Australia the following year.  This was another lost opportunity to
reenfranchise aboriginals in WA and QLD.

* 1958 

However, a parliamentary committee was convened which was to
recommend changes to the Electoral Act, repeal of Section 127 of the
Constitution and transfer of responsibility for aborigines from the
States to Canberra (basically because QLD and WA weren't to be
trusted).  This is basically the agenda of the 1963 Electoral Act
amendments and the 1967 referendum (see below).

Throughout the 1950's members from both sides of Parliament made
attempts to amend the Electoral Act.  These included Gough Whitlam who
made several speechs and introduced amendments on several occasions,
and Malcom Fraser who centered his first speech on apartheid and
touched on Australia's treatment of its own people.

* 1963	 

The Federal Government amended the Electoral Act to enfranchise
aborigines in WA and QLD at Federal Elections.  However they were
still unable to vote in State elections.
	 
Some of the background to this event was only revealed recently when
the cabinet papers were released under the 30 year rule.  It appears
that the Attorney General Garfield Barwick recommended that the
constitution *also* be amended at this time.  The PM Robert Menzies
overruled his cabinet and rejected this, accepting only the Electoral
Act changes.  Garfield Barwick had apparently also tried the previous
year to get these changes through.

* 1966 Robert Menzies retires, and legislation is passed for the 1967
referendum under the new PM Harold Holt.

* 1967 Referendum is passed overwhelmingly:

Highest result: 95% yes in Victoria 
Lowest result:  71% yes in WA

It was defeated in only *one* of over 1200 electoral subdistricts.  No
referendum has ever been more convincingly passed.  As a result of
this referendum aboriginals: (1) gain the vote in WA and QLD *State*
elections, and (2) become citizens. Also power for their welfare
passes to the Federal government which is able to initiate spending on
health, education and housing programs (and later land rights).

Summary. 

1. Aborigines had the Federal vote in 1900 in all states and
territories (bar the shenanigans of local officials), but could not
vote in WA and QLD State elections.  They have always had the vote in
all other States and Territories at both State and Federal level.

2. They lost the Federal vote in 1918 in WA and QLD

3. They regained it in WA and QLD in 1963

4. They became citizens in 1967, and gained the right to vote in WA and
QLD state elections.

The transfer of responsibility for aborigines to Canberra also allowed
Canberra to implement the UN Declaration of Human Rights and initiate
improvements in living conditions.

It is apparent that the long post WWII delay was due to the attitude
of Robert Menzies.  Despite broad, cross party support for aboriginal
enfranchisement and improvement of their plight, *no* action was taken
during most of the Menzies era (from 1949 to 1966).  The sole action
of granting the vote in 1963 was undertaken against his wishes and
only after much prodding.

Before 1967, the effect of Section 51 (xxvi) was to *prevent* the
Federal Government from spending *any* money on aboriginal programs.
Post 1967, it has allowed the Federal Government to undertake these
programs (remember that the Australian Federal Government is
constitutionally able to undertake *only* those activities specifically
allocated to it.)  The section does not really allow apartheid either.

The Mabo decision specifically excludes the use of this section to
override the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act (which itself
implements obligations placed on us by the UN Declaration of Human
Rights via the External Affairs power.)  Given that the Mabo decision
firmly establishes a non-racial basis to Australian common law, it is
very unlikely they would turn around and undo things.  (It is also
useful to remember that Mabo is not a "bolt from the blue", but simply
a relatively minor consequential decision based on many others over
the previous 30 years.)

A lot of anti-Mabo argument runs the line that all special legislation is
racist by definition, however:
- the Racial Discrimination Act allows positive discrimination,
- the High Court was invited to consider a rascist interpretation namely
  that while Eddie Mabo et al. where entitled to native title, that
  mainland aboriginals were "more primitive" and therefore could not
  benefit from the same entitlements.  The court specifically
  rejected this conclusion as "obnoxious".
- the ILO and UN conventions outline *minimum* standards, and specifically
  state that they cannot be used to reduce or eliminate existing rights
  which exceed their requirements.  This in itself would make rascist 
  laws unconstitutional.

* Don Bradman [RS]

Bradman, Sir Donald George (1908- ), cricket world's most famous
batsman. Born at Cootamundra NSW. Made his first century playing for
Bowral High School at age 12.  His career in the Australian domestic
competition, the Sheffield Shield, spanned 22 years playing for NSW
(1927-1934) and South Australia (1935-1949). He made a total of 8926
runs at an average of 110 at this level of cricket.

Most famous are his Test Match batting exploits against England for
the prized "Ashes" (the symbol of cricket supremacy between Australia
and England). So successful was he in the 1929 England tour that by
the time of the reciprocal 1932/33 English tour, the England captain,
Douglas Jardine, devised a bowling strategy around limiting Bradman's
prodigous scoring talents. England's fast bowlers would direct the
ball at a batsman's rib cage or throat hoping that the ball would be
parried to one of a number of close-in fieldsmen. The infamous
"Bodyline" tactic was not only applied to Bradman but also to the less
able batsmen which raised howls of outrage from the Australian public.
Bodyline was subsequently outlawed.

Apart from one Test match in the 1932-33 series, Bradman played in
every Australia-England Test match between 1928 and his retirement at
the end of the 1948 season. As a test captain from 1936-48, he did not
lose an Ashes series and the 1948 tour did not result in a single
defeat. An achievement unequalled by any touring Australian team
before or since.

He also played Test cricket against the West Indies (1930-31), South
Africa (1931-32) and India (1947-48). In all, Don Bradman played 52
Test matches, scored an aggregate 6996 runs at an average of 99.94.
Where Test Match batting averages of around 50 or 60 earns a player
the label of a "great", the Don's greatness as a batsman is more than
just an exxagerated legend.

* Ned Kelly [SR]

Ned Kelly was a bushranger, or outlaw who gained notoriety last
century with his gang "The Kelly Gang".  They were responsible for
many holdups of travellers.  His "trademark" was an iron helmet and
breastplate which he fashioned from an old plough late in his
"career".  He was finally captured in a bloody shootout at a place
called Glenrowan, where the gang was beseiged by troopers.  I think
the gang was all killed, except for Kelly who stood off the troopers
in his armour until his wounds overcame him.  He was promptly hung a
short time later, his last words being "Such is life".  It should not
be too difficult to find more information in any book of Australian
folklore, as he has attained the fame in Australia that outlaws in
America have similarly received.

* Frank Hardy [JS]

Feb 4, 1994. Frank Hardy died last weekend. He was found in his
reading chair, holding a racing form. Many people have said that
that's the way he'd have wanted to go.

Frank Hardy was a novelist, communist and sometime anarchist. Although
I deplore his politics, especially his earlier support of Stalinism, I
cannot but admire someone so committed to justice.  He was most famous
for his novel _Power Without Glory_ (see Section 14.3.1); the fictional
story of an imaginary racketeer named John West who rose to power in
Melbourne through his involvement in illegal gambling. Hardy was sued
for libel by businessman John Wren on behalf of Wren's wife for the
many admitted similarities in their lives stories.

With the death of Frank Hardy we have lost another hold on our past.
In his larrakin contempt for the establishment and his sometimes rowdy
support for the working class was represented the true Labor hero,
before champagne and high society dinners were acceptable. More than
Labor's loss, the Conservatives have lost a worthy foe. All of
Australia is the poorer for Frank Hardy's passing.

[AT] While Power Without Glory was his most famous work in some
circles since it ended up as a TV series.  Probably his best novel was
"But The Dead Are Many".  He also produced several novels with a
humorous bent, based on glorifying class struggle.  Off hand, I can
remember _The Outcasts Of Foolgarah_.  Also, he was not initially sued
for libel.  He was charged with criminal libel.  This is a rarely
invoked law which is a criminal rather than civil offence.  That is,
they arrest you and lock you away.  Wasn't there a foreward to Power
Without Glory which described his arrest ?

[JL] It depends which edition you have :-). The full story of the
attack on Power is contained in Frank's book "The Hard Way". My parents
knew Frank and Roslyn well. Mum's favourite recollection of Frank is a
non political one. Occasionally he used to ring her for a lift home
when "under the weather". Due to this state, whenever they hit a
corner on her motorbike, he would lean against the turn, trying to
stay upright. If you have ever tried to cope with this you will know
why she remembers it.  I understand a lot of the binding of the
(illegal) second edition was done in my grandmother's best (never
used) bedroom, and that the wardrobe was used to store them.  BTW the
author on the early copies of Power was Ross Franklyn - a near anagram
of Frank and Roslyn.

[JL] Frank made many contributions to political life in Australia. His
support for aboriginal land rights, and the Gurindji in particular,
exemplified this. I don't suppose there would be many ex-servicemen
who remember him from the Northern Territory and WWII on the net :-)

I used to have a copy of "Journey into the Future" somewhere, which
was Frank's book extolling the virtues of the Soviet bloc during the
fifties.  I always remember talking to Dorothy Healy, a socialist from
the New American Movement, about the seemingly uncritical support of
the Soviet Union by older comrades. Her reply was to the effect that
when it was the only country moving towards socialism, and under
attack from all sides, such support was understandable. In the 1970's
(when this discussion took place) this was not tenable, as there were
many countries trying many different alternative forms of government,
and unconditional support for any one country was not logical.  Frank
was a product of his era, his shortcoming should be measured against
that era, and his achievements remembered.  I wonder, when they went
across for a drink after the eulogy, whether they left a glass on the
bar? Frank would have liked that.

7.7 Miscellaneous

8.POLITICS

8.1 Political System 

Australia is an independent commonwealth of 6 states, 2 territories
and a number of island and territorial dependencies.  It is a member
of the Commonwealth of Nations, United Nations, ANZUS, OECD.  The form
of government is a constitutional monarchy. The Queen Elizabeth II of
Great Britain is also Queen of Australia, and Head of State. Her
representative in Australia is the Governor-General, Bill Hayden since
1989.

The Commonwealth of Australia uses the Westminster system of government.  
The head of State is the Queen, represented here by the Governor-General.
The G-G is advised by the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. Normally the 
convention says that the G-G "does what they tell him", but he has 
considerable "reserve powers". These powers are not necessarily spelled
out by the Constitution.

The federal parliamentary system consists of two houses of Parliament.
The lower house is the House of Representatives. The party which has
the most representatives in the lower house forms a government.  The
leader of that party becomes Prime Minister, and he (no women PMs as
yet) forms a Cabinet.  The usual term of office is 3 years, although
the PM may call an election early.  The Upper House is the Senate, the
"State House", like the US Senate. It consists of of 12 senators from
each state and 2 from each territory.  They have 6 year terms and half
face re-election every 3 years.  The upper house is generally a house
of review.  The Senate stands for a fixed term give or take a couple
of months, but the House of Representatives can be dissolved and an
election called by the cabinet. Elections only stay in sync by the
House of Representatives running full term, or the government
engineering a double dissolution.

Much of the Westminster system relies on convention and not written
rules, so often reading the Constitution is of no help if you are not
a Constitutional lawyer - its doesn't always say quite what it means
or mean quite what it says, if you are unbriefed in the vagaries of
these things. It was modelled on several other nations' constitutions
(incl. the US). There is no Bill of Rights or other "amendments" to
the constitution as Americans are familiar with the concept - it
merely defines the way the governments works.

For an illustration of the "convention" problem, for instance, the
Prime Minister, who is the effective Head of Government, is hardly (if
at all) mentioned in the Constitution. The Prime Minister is elected
by the House of Representatives. The PM then appoints the Cabinet.

The power of the Commonwealth is defined in the Constitution, i.e. the
things it has control of are explicitly laid out there - everything
else is left to the states. Usually when the Commonwealth wants to
take over some function from the states it usually uses its "external
affairs" powers.  This gives it considerable leeway. If the
Commonwealth has signed an "external treaty", for instance a UN
agreement to protect "world heritage wilderness" it can then force the
States to comply (that's how the Commonwealth forces states to stop
the Franklin Dam, for instance, where Land Management is left to the
states).

The main parties are the Labor Party, the Liberal Party (who are
actually conservatives) and the National Party (formerly the Country
party) who represent mainly rural electorates and are also
conservative. The Liberal and National parties usually form some sort
of coalition.

Each state has a House of Representatives (the lower house)
and all except Qld have an upper house. The leader of each State
government is called the Premier, and is the leader of the party
with a majority in the lower house.

[FC] The constitution, along with a lot of other info about Australia, is
available on WWW at: http://life.anu.edu.au/education/australia.html

8.2 Voting System 

* How to Vote

Each Australian citizen should be registered on the electoral rolls at
the age of 18.  Voting in Australia is compulsory. In practice, this
means that you have to go to a voting station, receive voting papers
and get your name ticked off. You do not have to cast a valid vote.
Typically "informal" votes range from 5-10% of the vote.

People who were granted permanent resident status and were enrolled to
vote before 1984 may continue to do so. Those who neglected to enroll
to vote before 1984 cannot vote regardless of when they're permanent
residency was granted, unless they become citizens.

Votes usually cast their vote at a local polling station in their
electorate. If you are not in your electorate on the day of the vote,
you can go to any polling station and cast an "absentee" vote. If you
do not think you will be able to go to a polling station on the day,
you can cast a postal vote earlier.

To cast a postal vote overseas, write to the nearest embassy or
consulate, or call them.  They will send you a form to fill in (which
has to be witnessed by an Australian citizen). They then send you the
postal vote slip, which you have to return by a date usually before
the election.

[SW] You can have yourself removed from the electoral rolls if you
intend to leave the country for in excess of 3 years.

* Electoral Structure and Voting System.

[I got several good summaries, so I've included them all for the
moment. The next FAQ maintainer might like to compress them. AN]

[PD, AN]

Australia is divided into 147 federal electorates. Each electorates
elects a member to the House of Representatives.  The voting system is
compulsory preferential voting.  "Preferential Voting System" is used
in all Lower Houses in Australia except Tasmania. Also used in the
Upper House (Legislative Council I think) in Victoria (whose upper
house is made of "super- electorates") Historically, it was brought in
(there is a little supposition here) because at the time of Federation,
Conservative politic was divided into two Parties; Free Traders and
Protectionists while the Left was only the Labour Party. The
Conservatives didn't want what occurs to the left in England now to
affect them; namely with a First past the post system, Labour could
have won office with, say, 40% of the vote.

Anyway, the philosophy behind it is that the most preferred candidate
is elected. (Or more precisely the least preferred candidate is not
elected!) When voting the elector must number all candidates from most
preferred to least preferred (ie say 1-4 for four candidates), i.e.  not
put a cross next the name in a first past the post system.  Primary
votes are counted, i.e.  who got no 1. If there is not an absolute
majority of votes for some candidate (winner outright), then candidate
with least votes has their preferences distributed. To do this votes
of least popular candidate ONLY, are given in full to voters' 2nd
preference. If there is still not an absolute majority then 2nd least
popular candidate's next preferences are redistributed.  In the worst
case, no candidate will get over 50% until there are only 2 candidates
remaining, by which stage there must be a winner.  If there is a draw
between 2 candidates at the end (50% each) the winner is drawn "out of
the hat."

Example: round 1 (first preferences) (100 votes)
      Fred    35 <- less than 50% Must distribute preferences
      Jane    30
      Paul    25
      Bronie  10 <- least votes; eliminated; goto no 2's on
      		    on ballot; Paul 7; Fred 2; Jane 1

      Round 2
      Fred 	35+2 = 37
      Jane	30+1 = 31 <- eliminated because of fewest votes
      Paul	25+7 = 32
      		prefences (note if someone had Jane 1, Bronie 2, then
you would look at who they had 3!) Fred 12; Paul 19

      Round 3
      Fred	35+2+12=49
      Paul	25+7+19=51 <- Paul elected (This example shows why
      		how the preferences are distributed and why the 
      		political parties have scrutineers watching the vote
      		counting (ie to count how many preferences))

Most states have optional preferential voting, which is the same as
compulsory preferential except that if preferences are not marked then
those votes are eliminated from the count.

The federal Senate is elected with a proportional representation (PR)
voting system.  Until the mid 80s, on the Senate ballot paper, the
electors had to fill out all boxes (usually of the order of 50 in
Victoria). Of course this led to a high incidence of invalid votes.
Since then, they changed the law so that the names of the political
affiliations of the candidates could be placed on all ballots papers.
(Previously, once you entered the polling booth, if you didn't know
who represented what, you had to guess.) This law enabled a
simplification of the Senate Ballot. Now, you have a choice; filling
in all 50+ boxes; or filling in one (and only one) box which signifies
a particular party (and not candidate). Then the preferences are
distributed as predetermined by the party. (They must inform voters
before the election how they will distribute theor preferences!)

The idea of the proportional representation system is that the
candidates represent an equal cross-section of both the community and
the country (hence 6 Senators in each state per election no matter
what the population is; this was a compromise made to the smaller
states at Federation as they feared (probably quite rightly) that
they'd be "crushed" by Victoria and New South Wales.)  Anyway the
system means that there is a "quota" of votes required to elect a
candidate. This quota is determined by the following formula

Total number of Votes/(no of positions +1) +1 = Quota.
                                                ---- (and rounded down)

Eg 100 votes, 6 seats -> 100/(6+1) + 1 = 15.3 Quota 15 votes.  (Note
that if 6 candidates get 15 votes, a seventh candidate can only get
10. (It works better with bigger numbers)

Now the counting of votes works in part as with the preferential
system (ie lowest candidate eliminated and preferences distributed),
but there is a twist. If a candidate gets above the quota (ie quota
20; Jane get 25 votes, then her preferences are ALL distributed at a
reduced values (to the total of 5 votes) according to the formula

(Candidate Votes-Quota)/Candidate votes = Value of preferences
(25-20)/25 = 0.2

As you can see this makes for a hell of a lot of difficulty and is why
while HofR results are known quickly, Senate votes take of the order
of a month or more to be determined!

* State Systems

All the states except for Tassie use single member electorates for the
lower houses. Tasmania has 6 multimember electorates, same system as
the senate.

The upper houses in the States (except for Qld which doesn't have one)
are mainly single member electorates, universal sufferage, but it had
been property franchise up to 60's or 70's in some states.  Upper
house electorates in some states still vary in number of electors by
huge margins in some states notably WA. Conservative upper house
gerrymander is very severe. There are as many systems in detail as
states. There is part of the house based on electorates and part on PR
in NSW [confirm? AN].

Australia's Different Voting Systems [JL]
====================================

What is preferential voting?
----------------------------

The aim of a representative electoral system is to elect people who 
represent their constituency. It is simple, intuitive almost, to see that
where you are trying to elect one person, that person should have the
support of over 50% of their constituents before they can claim to reflect
the views of their constituency.

There are two practical problems which this creates. Firstly, how do you
guarantee one person will end up with over 50% of the votes if more than
two people are standing? Secondly, is it fair, that in a worst case
scenario, with a close vote, that nearly 50% of constituents will be
unrepresented.

Answer 1 - Exhaustive Preferential Voting
-----------------------------------------

OK, we have one person to be elected, and more than two candidates.
The quota (the number of votes needed to be elected) is 1/2 plus 1, ie
50% plus one. This quota is commonly called a majority.

In exhaustive preferential voting, squares are placed next to the
names of each candidate. Constituents number these squares in order of
their choice. "1" goes against the person you most want, "2" against
the next person, and so on down the ballot paper.

After voting, all the ballot papers are sorted according to the number
"1" votes, and the papers are counted. If no-one has a majority (ie
has attained the quota) then the person who has the lowest number of
papers is removed from the ballot, and that person's papers a
distributed to the candidate of next choice (at this stage the number
"2" votes) and the results are tallied again.  This process of
deleting the lowest, continues until a candidate finally gains a
majority. That candidate is then declared elected. In this way is is
ensured that there will always be one candidate with a majority.

Answer 2 - Proportional Representation
--------------------------------------

There are different forms of proportional representation around. The
most rigorous (and therefore most accurate in terms of reflecting the
constituents) is Hare-Clark, which is used in Tasmania, ACT, (and, I
think Eire?). Another name for PR is Quota Preferential. The
differences between these forms are minor in procedure, but major in
effect.

First, let's look at this conceptually. Remember that what we are
trying to do is select people who can represent their constituents, ie
the chamber of parliament being elected should reflect the diversity
of views in the constituencies.

In a single member system, the worst case is that 1/2 - 1 voters did
not want the elected person. Remember, 1/2 + 1 to get elected. If two
people were to be elected we can't have a quota of 1/2 + 1 to get
elected, because there aren't enough votes; if there are two to be
elected then they should represent at least a third of the
constituents. That is, the quota becomes 1/3 + 1. Similarly, if three
are to be elected, the quota is 1/4 + 1. The interesting thing, and
this is why there are multi member constituencies, is that the more
members you have representing a constituency, the fewer people are un
represented. This is easier to see in a table. Remember this is a
worst case scenario

No elected	quota  		total people electing 	total unrepresented
1		1/2 + 1		1/2 + 1			1/2 - 1
2		1/3 + 1		2/3 + 2			1/3 - 2
3		1/4 + 1		3/4 + 3			1/4 - 3
4		1/5 + 1		4/5 + 4			1/5 - 4

So that deals with the "why" of multi member constituencies. The next
thing to deal with is the "how".

Single user constituencies are easy. Enter your choices, and only one
person can get a quota. In a multi member constituency, what if one
candidate gets, for example, two quotas?  If we had a "real time"
voting scenario, then people could simply punch in their choice, and
when that person got to the quota, they would be taken off the list of
available choices. For various reasons, including ensuring a secret
ballot, that is impractical, so the following algorithm is used.

1  Sort and count the papers according to first choice.
2a If one or more persons is elected, take the one with the highest
   vote, distribute their surplus (see below). Go to 2a.
2b If no one is elected, cut up the papers for the lowest count
   candidate at full value and distribute according to next available
   choice. Go to 2a.
3  Finish.

What, I hear you cry, is a surplus? The surplus is the number of votes
in excess of a quota, so if the quota is 300, and a candidate has 500,
their surplus is 200. Now, it's here that Hare-Clark differs from the
senate. In the senate, they will select 200 of the 500 papers, at
random, and distribute them to the remaining candidates according to
the next available choice after the candidate being cut up.

In Hare-Clark, each paper is given a transfer value according to the
surplus - in our example we have 500 papers worth a surplus of 200,
therefore each paper is given a value of 200/500 or .4 of a vote and
all papers are distributed to the remaining candidates according to
the next available choice after the candidate being cut up.

It's just two different approaches to the distribution of the surplus.
They are both statistical manipulations, but I personally believe that
it only requires a moment's thought to see that Hare-Clark has more
reproducable results.

It is not an empty claim by Hare-Clark proponents, that Hare-Clark
changes "one person, one vote" into "one person, one effective vote".

Proportional Representation and Political Parties
-------------------------------------------------

I am from Tasmania, the home of Hare-Clark. In addition to having
arguably the fairest method of counting, several different ballot
papers are printed, with the candidate's names rotated on the ballot
papers, so that the "donkey" vote does not work in favour of any one
party or individual. Candidates can be grouped on the ballot paper by
party.

One of the more interesting things which I have seen over the years
while scrutineering at various elections and analysing results has
been the effect of multimember constituencies on political parties. If
you think about it, it is possible to have a major spill of elected
politicians, without changing the party which is in power. This has
happened more than once. Recently, the person who precipitated a
change of leadership within a particular political party was not
elected, even though the party was came to power.

It has also spelt the end of imposed candidates. Political parties
have a harder time, in fact an almost impossible task, to win all
seats in a multimember constituency. They are forced to present a
range of candidates, to maximise their vote. It is not always their
number one choice who is elected. Political parties see this as voters
being capricious, but, hopefully, they are comparing realities.

The how-to-vote card is dead. They do not work. The only way this
survives in any form is in the senate vote-by-party option.

A final interesting note. One candidate I knew, campaigned on the
basis of asking for the number 2 vote. His line was, look I'm not
going to insult your intelligence by telling you not to vote for the
person you want to, but consider me for number 2. Umm, he did not get
elected, but if he'd not been carrying some personal handicaps, I
think it would have been a very effective pitch.

[JS] SENATE VOTING SYSTEM
====================

The Australian Senate is Australia's Upper House, which serves a
similar function to Britain's House of Lords. Senators are elected by
Australian citizens on a State-by-State basis; that is, each State can
be considered as a separate electorate returning separate candidates.
The Northern and Australian Capital Territories each return two
senators, while the States return senators in proportion to their
population.

The ballot cast by voters is in two sections. One section allows
voters to vote preferentially for their choice of candidate - that is,
to place a 1 next to the name of the candidate whom they most prefer;
a 2 next to the name of the candidate they rank second; and so forth.
The other section lets them tick the name of a political party, in
which case their preferences are allocate according to the wishes of
that party. This is easier, and most people do this.

The method of voting is as follows: Each vote is given a starting
value of 1. The number of votes cast is divided by the number of
candidates to be returned plus one, and one is added to the dividend.
This is called the *quota*.

Example: if there are 100 voters and 3 positions to fill, the quota
would be (100 / (3 + 1)) + 1 = 26. If you think about it, if three
candidates have each received 26 out of 100 votes they will certainly
have more votes than any other candidate.

If no candidates have received enough votes to fill a quota, the
candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated from the election and
his or her votes redistributed to the next person on the ballot papers
- that is, to the person the voter has nominated as his or her second
choice. This continues until at least one candidate has achieved a
quota.

When at least one candidate has achieved the quota, we calculate the
number of votes that the most successful candidate has received in excess
of the quota. This number, divided by the quota, is the *transferrable
value* of that vote, and all votes cast for the candidate are
redistributed with that value to the next person on the ballot papers.

Example: Mr Smith receives 39 first preference votes. As above, he
only needed 26 to be elected. He is declared elected, and the votes
cast for him are redistributed to other candidates with a value of 
(39 - 26) / 39 = 1/3. That is, two-thirds of their "power" has been used
up in electing Mr Smith.

We now see if any other candidates have achieved the quota. If so,
they are elected and their votes transferred as above. If not, we
eliminate candidates until one has achieved a quota and continue as
above.

It's complicated to explain, but simple (albeit slow) in operation. It
is tends to result in a Senate evenly divided between the two major
parties, with a few Independents and minor party senators holding the
balance of power. As such, it more nearly reflects the voting pattern
of the populace than any system of which I know.

8.3 Current governments

The current Prime Minister is Paul Keating, and we have a Labor
government. They have been in power since 1983 (mostly with Bob Hawke
as PM).  The current leader of the Liberal party is Alexander Downer,
who defeated Dr. John Hewson (a New Right person) in a party ballot in
early June '94; current lead of the National Party is Tim Fischer.

The most recent federal election was held on March 13th, 1993. The
Labor Party, lead by Paul Keating was returned with an increased
majority, to the surprise of many. The unpopular GST tax being
proposed by the Opposition was considered a major factor in the
outcome, as Labor came from behind in the polls at the start of the
campaign.  Hewson stayed on as leader of the Liberals, but the GST was
dropped from their platform. It is not clear yet how Liberal policy
may change under Downer.

8.4 Taxation

* Total taxation

Comparison of all forms of taxation, with source December 1993 issue
of the Economist. [TvR]

	 USA                27%
	 Switzerland        32%
	 Germany            39%
	 Italy              31%
	 Australia          27%
highest  Sweden             50%
lowest   Bahamas             5%

* Personal income tax

Here is a table of the most recent figures for Australia's personal income
tax rates.

Part of Your Income             Tax
      ($)             (cents in the dollar)
------------------------------------------
0       to 5400                 0
5401    to 20700                20
20701   to 38000                34
38001   to 50000                43
50001   & over                  47

(plus 1.4 cents in the dollar for MediCare levy)

Tax is taken out of each pay-packet you receive by your employer.
(You are called a PAYE taxpayer - Pas As You Earn).

Example: Suppose that you earn $44,000 a year. Income tax + medicare
levy is (20700-5401)*0.2 + (38000-20701)*.34 + (44000-38001)*.43 +
44000*.014 = 3059.8 + 5881.66 + 2579.57 + 616 = 11520.83 + 616 =
$12136.83.

[AN: Need to check that medicare is over the whole amount]

* Corporate taxation [JB]

Corporate tax is 33%. Australia has an almost unique system whereby
company income is *NOT* taxed again if it is passed on the
shareholders as dividends.  The system, known as "dividend imputation"
works roughly like this:

If you get a dividend cheque from a company for $1,000, it will often
be accompanied by a notice saying that it is "fully franked" or
"partially franked" and that it has "imputation credits" of, say,
$500.  This means that your "share" of the company's profits were
$1,500, on which $500 company tax has already been paid.  When you do
your personal tax return, you declare income from this source of
$1,500, and the tax credit of $500.  If your marginal tax rate is less
than the company tax rate, you will, in effect, get some of the $500
back.  If your marginal rate is higher, you will have to pay some more
to make up the difference,

This system, which was introduced in 1985, did away with the previous
system wherein company profits were taxed twice. This "double
taxation" was a sore point with business for decades. Dividend
imputation was brought in by that arch-fiend, Paul Keating, which is
conveniently forgotten by people who want to paint him as a socialist
enemy_of_business.

* Indirect taxes [DlC]

Compared to many western countries, particularly those with general
Goods and Services Taxes (GSTs or VATs), Australia does not have much
sales tax.  The biggest source of government revenue is Income Tax.
Australia and the US share the place for having the lowest taxation as
a percentage of GDP of any major Western economies (27%).  Yet despite
this we have one of the highest rates of personal income tax.  The
main reason is the low rate (overall) of sales tax and "shock horror"
customs duties.

But unlike many western countries the rates that sales tax is charged,
in Australia, varies substantially.  Less than 50% of all goods and
services (in dollar values) do not have any sales tax at all.  For
example food, health, rent, education, power, water, are all exempt.
Ie those items deemed essential.  Where tax is levied, it is levied,
at least officially, by the Federal Government (I'll return to this).
Most goods (no services are taxed) are taxed at 20%.  I've read that
the figure is something like 80% of goods which are taxed are taxed at
this rate.

Some goods are taxed at higher rates for a range of reasons.  For
example the taxes on cigarettes are very high, supposedly for health
reasons.  I don't know what the rate is, but I suspect it is much
higher than 37%.  Some items which are taxed at levels higher than 20%
include luxury cars (cars whose purchase price exceeds $A45,000),
expensive liquors, and beer (wine is only 15% but it will move to 25%
- was that the eventual compromise?), petrol, luxury boats.  In each
case there is an official motive, eg it is considered a good idea by
many to make petrol expensive, to encourage people to use public
transport.  Can anyone explain to me why wine should be taxed less
than beer, is it because the middle class (ie Democrat, Liberal and
Green voters) drink the former and the working class drink the latter?
[How's that for flame bait?]

The number of items that have sales tax is always growing, and there
has been a slow consolidation of the various rates into a general rate
of 20%.  In the early 80s our current prime minister was treasurer and
he attempted to introduce an across the board goods(not services)tax.
Many people have quipped that over the last 10 years the Prime
Minister has achieved his original aim by stealth.  This attempt was
unsuccessful.  The opposition, who recently proposed, unsuccessfully, a
GST, rolled the governments original proposal by bringing out a legion
of people to say, "You mean my cornflakes will go up by $0.50.....".
Needless to say the same tactics were then employed by the current
government to roll the opposition.  Quid pro quo?

[JB] Vary widely, ranging from about 70% on petrol to 0% on most foodstuffs,
books, clothing, etc. Averages about 5% across all purchases.

* State taxes

There are no state income taxes. The States receive the bulk of their
revenue from distrubution of general federal revenue according to a
"formula". [What is this formula?]. Traditionally NSW and Vic have
received less per capita than the other states. State governments are
limited in what they can do to raise state taxes: cigarette and
alcohol, payroll tax, death duties, ???. Charges for state services
and fees such as gas and electricity, motor registration. Victoria
currently has a $100 tax levied per "rate-able property", excluding
property used for primary production.

The State governments provide primary and secondary education.  The
Federal Government pays totally for tertiary education, using a
technique known as "tied grants" to the states. The money appears
briefly in the State budgets, but cannot be put to any other use.[JB]

The State government has no role in the provision of non-hospital
health services. This is done independently by doctors. The State
governements do provide the "public" hospital services, but also under
a complicated funding system with the Federal government. [JB]

* Local taxes

Local city councils or shire councils in the country, raise money
through rates, basically property taxes on houses/land.

8.6 Mabo

The High Court, in the "Mabo" decision, eliminated the previous terra
nullius principle of land ownership in Australia, and stated that
there was a Common Law ownership by the indigenous people, unless that
title had been extinguished by a valid Act of the imperial. colonial,
state, commonwealth or territorial parliamnts. They also said that
common law ownership depended on a demonstrated continuos link between
the people and that land.  [JB]

Native title is NOT freehold title, for instance, the land cannot be
sold, but according to commonwealth law, can be converted into
freehold title if the owners so desire. [Scot]

8.7 Health Care [JM]

8.7.1 Medicare 

Medicare is a universal medical insurance scheme run by the Federal
Government covering all Australian citizens and permanent residents.
The Medicare scheme covers all Australian citizens and permanent
residents, and provides "basic" medical cover.  This comprises:

- 85% of the "Schedule Fee" for services provided by GP's and medical
  specialists.

- Treatment in a public hospital in a "public" standard ward.

Those who are eligible have a Medicare Card with a name and number on
it.

Foreign visitors are also covered if there is a reciprocal arrangement
between Australia and their country.  This is most likely to exist
where the other country also has a public health system akin to
Medicare.  For example, an agreement exists with the UK (which has the
National Health) but not the USA.

Overall, the level of care provided by Medicare is excellent.
Aboriginal health in rural areas is sometimes, however, quite
shocking. The Govt looks like it will finally do something about this
(Sen. Richardson, the Health Minister, is on a crusade, which was
surprising provoked by the new AMA head). [Scot]

8.7.2 Medicare Levy

The Medicare Levy is a payment levied on all Australian taxpayers in
order to pay for the Medicare scheme.  The levy is currently 1.4% of
taxable income.

8.7.3 Doctors

Doctors in Australia are generally private practitioners and charge a
fee for each service they provide, or medical procedure performed.

In Australia students choose to study medicine when they leave high
school. Medicine is one of the most competitive courses to get into.
The first 3 years are pre-clinical course work undertaken at the
university (i.e. chemistry, physics, biochemistry, anatomy,
pharmacology, etc).  The 4th to 6th years are clinical training.
Typically students are attached to one hospital, and do rotations
through the major medical disciplines. In their final year students
can choose to spend time at another institution (which may be
overseas) in any specialty they like. At the end of their 6 years,
they take their final exams. After that, they have to do at least a
year's residency before they are qualified to practice. More
residencies and qualifications are needed for any specialty, and
further qualifications are needed even to become a GP. [AN]

* Overseas doctors working in Australia [PW]

To practice medicine in oz you need to be registered with the state
medical council (whatever it's called).  You can do this in a number
of ways: (1) Do (and pass :-) a medical course in an ozzie or kiwi
uni, (2) Do medicine at a recognised+ overseas uni and then pass the
medical council's exam (about equivalent to ozzie finals), (3) Have a
degree from one of these medical schools, have obtained fellowship of
one of the specialist medical colleges and have >3 years specialist
experience (ie, be the equivalent of an ozzie consultant).  You might
also have to do an english exam if it isn't your first language.

+ a list of recognised universities and appropriate qualifications
will be supplied by the medical council, I think they include most UK,
Ireland and main USA medical schools.  If you didn't go to one of
these places then see method (1).

Note: Until 18 months ago the different states had different
requirements for registration of foriegn medics; NSW was as described
above.  However, they then standardised to the NSW system to make the
states consistently strict (with the previous system, you could
register in queensland and a transfer to NSW).

8.7.4 Fees (What you Pay at the Doctor)

Generally, patients are charged by doctors on the basis of the
"Schedule Fee".  This refers to a schedule of standard fees for
medical procedures and services.

The Schedule Fee was originally a standard fee set by the doctors
professional organisation (the Australian Medical Association - AMA)
however in recent years (particularly as the influence of the AMA has
declined) it has come to be set by agreement amongst the State and
Federal Government.

The exact amount a particular patient will be charged is based on the
Schedule Fee, but could be modified by one or more of the following
factors:

- Does the doctor "bulk bill"

In this case, the patient pays nothing.

Since the introduction of Medicare in 1975, many doctors have moved to
"bulk billing".  This is a procedure where the doctor bills the
Medicare scheme directly rather than the patient.  The downside (for
the doctor) is that they only get the Medicare payment of 85% of the
schedule fee.  The term "bulk" is used because the doctor can simply
issue a single invoice at the end of the month, rather than separately
billing every patient.

If the doctor *doesn't* bulk bill, the patient would pay the bill and
then seek reimbursment from Medicare.

- Is the patient privately insured

In this case the patient will generally pay according to his or her
insurance cover.  This differs from policy to policy but is usually
nothing, unless the doctor charges more than the schedule fee (see
below).

However, the *doctor* in this case, gets paid the full Schedule Fee,
and a bill is issued to the patient.  The patient would then pay the
bill and seek reimbursement for 85% of the fee from Medicare and the
rest from the insurer.  (Although most insurers have a deal with
Medicare so their clients need only make a claim through them rather
than stand in two queues.)

- Does the doctor charge *more* than the schedule fee?

Some doctors (whether through ability, reputation, or greed) charge
more than the schedule fee.  In this case, all patients pay the doctor
direct and seek reimbursement from Medicare or their insurer.

Typically, the patient is out of pocket to the extent to which the
doctor charges above the schedule fee.

Summary:
- patients without private insurance usually go to bulk billing doctors
  and pay nothing.
- patients with private insurance pay up front and get the money back
  (but often not all of it) from their insurer.

(An aside.  The scheme above has placed economic pressure on doctors
over the last 20 years, and many doctors now work in modern 24 hour/7
day clinics which bulk bill and treat both insured and uninsured
patients.  Such clinics have proved to be very profitable and efficient
and now appear in even the "best" suburbs.)

8.7.5 Public Hospitals

The Australian hospital system has two sectors, the first is public
and is run by the State governments, the second is private (see
below).  The public system treats the whole range of conditions
including trauma and serious, (unlike the private system).

Funding for public hospitals is provided by State Governments. 

Some public hospitals run private "annexes" for services such as
maternity.  These are profit making enterprises attached to the larger
public hospital.

From the patients point of view, you can attend a public hospital in one
of four ways:
of four ways:
  - Outpatient
  - Public ward		Generally about 8 beds to a ward
  - Intermediate ward	Between 4 and 6 beds to a ward
  - Private ward	Generally 2 beds to a ward, but sometimes only 1.

(Private insurance is required for treatment in an Intermediate or
Private ward.)

Patients are generally treated by registrars and salaried doctors in
the public system, however, many private practitioners serve for several
hours a week in public hospitals.  (For this work, they are paid
according to the Schedule Fee, so there is usually no financial loss.
However, some good specialists who are generally able to charge in
excess of the Schedule Fee *do* end up losing somewhat.)

There is an important issue concerning private health insurance and
emergency hospital admission. If you are admitted to a public hospital
in an emergency and have private health insurance, you will be
admitted as a private patient and end up with a surprising bill.  It
happens because, the so-called "public" patient is bulk-billed and
therefore accrues debts at 85% of the Schedule Fee.  Since Medicare
covers all of this, there is nothing left to pay.  However, "private"
patients are charged 100% of the Schedule Fee, but private insurance
typically only matches medicare by providing 85% coverage.  The
patient pays the balance. [JM]

8.7.6 Private Hospitals

Private hospitals are profit making entities (typically owned by a
syndicate of doctors, but sometimes by civic organisations or
insurance companies.)  They provide a range of routine surgical and
convalescent care, generally leaving more serious conditions to the
public hospitals in order to reduce their need for expensive capital
equipment.  (Although, there are exceptions to this. For example, many
private hospitals have found CAT and MRI scanning to be very
profitable.)

From a patients point of view, private hospitals provide only

does not in general affect Australia, we are too close to the equator.
Last summer (1992/93?) a small part of the outer edge did pass over
Tasmania and Victoria but lasted only for a couple of days and did not
cause particularly high levels of uv radiation at the ground.
Australians have the highest rates of skin cancer in the world
probably due to the combination of culture and having summer when the
earth is closest to the sun.  Bring a hat, sunscreen and shirt.  Don't
"bake" at all, but if you insist on being brown, authorities suggest
avoiding the strongest sunlight between 1100 and 1500 (summer time).

There was a big campain against skin cancer: "Slip slop slap".  It had
a cute little cartoon animal as the star of the commercial, a seagull,
whose "s's" were came out as a kind of cross between Donald Duck and
Sylvester the Cat.

The jingle went:

"Slip! Slop! Slap!
Slip on a shirt slop on sunscreen and slap on a hat!
Slip! Slop! Slap! (da-da)
In the sun this summer say,
'Slip-slop-slap!'"

There is an Ozone FAQ on sci.environment which is more likely to be
correct than what gets periodically posted on s.c.a.!

========================================================================

Figures are for 1992 according to various tables found in "The Economist".

* Wages, poverty level, homelessness [KH]

I recently claimed the "basic wage" in Oz was $16 per hour.  (This, of
course, applies to the counter staff here at LaTrobe.)  This is not
exactly correct. With recent changes (five years or so) to industrial
relations there is no real set minimum for full-time employees.
However, the following figures are authoritative (ABS and ATO for end
1992) if a little old:

Of the 7.8 million taxpayers known to the ATO ;-)

   Number  taxable income 1992
   or pct.

   1200    >500K
   1%      80-100K
   6.3%    50-80K
   46.1%   21-50K
   46.6%   <21K

The weighted average of these is 27.1K ($14.89 per hour); the
approximate median is 23.5K ($12.91 per hour).  These figures may or
may not be accurate. According to the ABS only 5.05m people in
Australia claim NOT to be in the workforce (i.e. 71% of the
population).

The claimed average work hours are 35.3 per week; for full-time
workers 41.1 hours per week; for part-time workers 15.3 per week.
From this we can calculate the approximate fraction of the workforce
in full-time employment is 75%.

More recent figures from the start of this year put the perceived cost
of living at about $460 per week for an average family ($13 per hour)
and the average salary at $660 per week ($18.85 per hour).  According
to the DSS the poverty level in Australia was set at about $255 per
week ($7.28 per hour) at end of 1992 (this is CPI indexed).  An
average family with no other means of support is eligible for a total
weekly payment of $352.85 ($10 per hour). Pensions for single persons
are less.

At the end of 1991 the DSS had a total number of 8065 persons
registered for the "Homeless Benefit". During 1992 all but 1902 were
(mostly) re-classified under "Job Search/New Start".  The 1902 were
thereafter allocated a "Special Benefit Allowance" that is intended
for "those people unable to support themselves or their dependents &
who are otherwise not entitled to a pension or other benefit". Many of
these recipients also receive additional rent or child support
payments.  It was estimated a further 1000 persons during 1993 had no
support whatever (although they are legally entitled to it) and were
living on the streets.

The legal minimum wage in the US at end of 1992 was $3.50 US per hour
for full-time employees. There was no set minimum (in my
understanding) for part-time or casual work.  The estimated number of
homeless persons in year 1993 in the US (i.e. without work and no form
of official benefit) was about 1.6 million.

* Australian deserts [KH]

Sturt            N SA                 50               24

Of the 3.3 M mi^2 of "The Sahara" about 30% is occupied by "the Grand
Eng" (i.e. the great sand sea). According to the texts the Simpson is
also a "sand sea" and, from what I've seen of it, "a lot" of it is
comparable. ;-)

To aid comparisons:

State/Country    Size (K sq mi)
Vic                   88
NSW                  309
SA                   380

France               213
U.K.                  94

I.e. the deserts of the Great WA Shield (i.e. Great Vic, Gibson and
Great Sandy) that kind-of run together (and I'm not getting down to
the country that runs along the Bite) account for quite a bit of
territory (i.e. 1/2 WA). Of course, "a lot" of it is fairly livable
country. People have been doing this for a few K years. ;-)

Artesian water underpins most of NSW, some of SA, most of NSW and Vic
and some coastal areas WA and NT. The drier climates are located off
of these (e.g. the WA Shield).

For those intending travel around any of the above -- I note that
Winter daytime temps average in excess of 30 C, Summer daytime temps
average in excess of 40 C. Nighttime temps in Summer are around 10 C
and Winter around 0 C. (We are taking a lot of territory into account
here -- the extremes from place-to-place are up to 10 C above/below
these figures).

9.2 National Holidays

(a) General Descriptions.

Australia Day: January 26th (holiday often taken on the nearest Monday
to this date to make a long weekend.)  Jan 26th 1788 was the day the
First Fleet arrived in Sydney Harbour to establish European
settlement.

Religious holidays: 
Good Friday, Easter Monday, Christmas (Dec 25th), Boxing Day (Dec 26th)

Anzac Day: national holiday, April 25th (if it falls on a Sunday some
states move it to Monday, most don't [JB]?).  To remember those who
died serving their country.  April 25th, 1915 was the date of the
first landing of ANZACs at Gallipoli.

Other holidays (varies depending on State): New Year's Day (Jan 1st),
- Queen's Birthday (June), Labour Day. Each state also has "Show Day".

[MJ] The following climate data was copied from the Australian Weather
Calendar.  If you see a number that is clearly wrong it is because I
mistyped it.  Please note that these are statistical averages over
(long) records (more than 100 years for the state capitals).  As such
they do not indicate what you may necessarily expect.  Much of
Australia has variable weather, particularly the south (e.g. Melbourne
in January has an average maximum temperature of 25.7 but can expect 4
days over 35).

Also note that over the 100+ years of data there have been "cool" and
"warm" decades.  Average temperatures for the last 20 years will, for
several cities at least, be a little higher than the figures quoted
here.  Finally, the column giving number of days > 35 refers to
maximum temperature, and the column of days < 2.3 refers to the
minimum temperature.  This corresponds to an expected number of days
of frost. A "rainday" is any day on which at least a trace (0.1mm) of
rain is recorded in a standard rain guage.

GOPHER: The Bureau of Meteorology has just set up a Gopher server to
provide forecast information for each state and territory around
Australia.  Currently only textual information is available, but we
hope to add charts and satellite images sometime in the future.  The
server is known as "babel.ho.bom.gov.au" and should be accessible
through AARNET at the normal Gopher port (i.e port 70).  Please note :
This service is initially purely experimental and will not be
supported outside normal office hours. Contact : Justin Baker, Central
Operations and Systems Branch, Bureau of Meteorology, Melbourne,
Australia e-mail : justinb@bom.gov.au.

* Miscellaneous facts: Temperatures at the coldest place in Australia
plunged to the lowest ever recorded Tuesday night (June 28, 1994).
The temperature at Charlotte's Pass in the Snowy Mountains in the
state of New South Wales dropped to -23C.  Australia's previous record
low of -22.2C was measured at Charlotte's Pass July 14, 1945, and
again August 8, 1947.  The country's record for the highest shade
temperature still stands after 105 years. This was 53.3 degrees
recorded at the outback town of Cloncurry in Queensland January 16,
1889.

* There is an Ozone FAQ on sci.environment which is more likely to be
correct than what gets periodically posted on s.c.a.!

which would probably be longer if there had been more time to document
the species which existed before the start of the industrial
revolution.  Many more probably went extinct before we even knew they
existed.

9.5 Fauna

[AT] Australia's plants and wildlife are very different to any other
continent.  This stems from Australia's long isolation and the climatic
conditions during this isolation.  Australia's isolation began as
Gondwanaland began to break up a 150 million years ago.  Up to about 60
million years ago a journey was possible Australia to South America
through Antartica.  Then came a period of almost complete isolation as
Australia.  drifted north.  In the last 10 million years a sea journey
from Asia has became easier but even the island hopping of very recent
immigrants like man would have involved a sea journey of at least 50km.

9.5.1 The Monotremes

[AT] The most remarkable of Australia's Gondwanan passengers are the
Platypus and echidnas.  These are egg-laying mammals known as the
monotremes.  Female monotremes incubate their eggs for 1-2 weeks.
After hatching the young depend on milk secreted by their mother for
3-5 months.  Monotremes occur only in Australian and New Guinea.

[RG] The Echidna is a small termite eating monotreme.  The Echidna's
back is covered with spines (a similar defense system to the
porcupine, though the two animals are not related).  Its short legs
are adapted for digging - the forelegs for digging into termite
mounds, and the hind legs for digging into the ground.  The animal's
defense is to quickly bury itself while raising the spines.  Very few
predators are capable of attacking the Echidna (though I believe
Dingos have managed to).  The Echidna is one of the world's two
monotremes (the other of which is the Platypus) which are the only egg
laying mammals.  Its species name is Tachyglossus Aculeatus.  Many
people in Australia mistakenly call them "porcupines", though a more
correct colloquial name for them is the Spiny Anteater.

[AT] To be picky there actually two species of Echidna and hence 3
extant monotreme species.  The Long-Beaked Echidna (Zachyglossus
bruini I think) is found in Papua New-Guinea.  The Short-Beaked
Echidna is found in both PNG and Australia. Both species have been
split in the past.  Echidnas also eat ants and occur in areas without
termites but not in areas without ants (but maybe there are no areas
with termites but no ants).

Like the Platypus, Echidnas possess receptor capable of detecting
minute electrical currents.  The Platypus presumably uses them for
detecting the nerve impulses of prey.  Its not obvious how the
Echidnas' receptors are useful.  One suggestion is that they allow
detection of trace concentrations of gases associated with termite
colonies when the gases dissolve on the Echidna's snout and produce
minute electrical currents.

Also remarkable is the diversity of habitats Short-Beaked Echidnas
occupy.  Everything from the arid interior to alpine areas of the Snowy
Mountains.  In the last 2-3 years researchers have monitored Echidnas
in the Kosciusko high country through the winter and found their
temperature regulation more complex than previously thought.  In the
past it was suggested monotremes had primitive temperature regulation
because they maintain a lower temperature than placentals and it
fluctuates more.  Clearly its not that simple and their temperature
regulation may be as well-adapted as many placental mammals.

9.5.2 Marsupials

Marsupials are another group of mammals distinguished by their method of
reproduction.  Their young are born at very early stage and crawl to
their mothers nipple where remain attached as they grow.  Often these
nipples a protected by a fold of skin forming a pouch.  This is
well-developed in the kangaroos where the young remain in this pouch for
up to 9 months and for some time after that occasionally return to the
pouch.  In some marsupials pouches are temporary and lost after
breeding, other marsupials have no pouches at all.  The pouches of
wombats and Koalas face the rear.

A few species of possum occur in North America and a larger number in
South America otherise marsupials are restricted to Australia and a few
islands north of Australia.  They are known from fossils in Europe,
Africa and Asia.

Globally most mammals fall into a third group called the placental
mammals (or eutherians).  Apart from marine mammals, the only placental
mammals native to Australia are bats and rodents.  Even so they make up
almost half our mammal species.

One group of rodents seems to have made a long sea journey from Asia at
least 5 million years ago and has adapted considerably to Australia
conditions.  Other rodents have arrived from Asia more recently.  A
recently discovered bat fossil, apparently the oldest known anywhere,
indicates bats were present in Australia much longer than previously
thought and may have been present in Australia before it became isolated.

Marsupials are sometimes described as more primitive than placental
mammals.  This is the result of Eurocentric bias causing differences to
be perceived inferiorities.  Neither reproductive method is consistently
superior to the other.

Many thought that Australia's marsupial diversity results from isolation
protecting them from placental mammal competition.  A recent discovery
of a placental tooth disproves this, showing terrestial placental
mammals reached Australia before it became isolated but did not persist.

Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary in Fig Tree Pocket in Brisbane has Kangaroos
in an enclosure that will willing eat out of the palm of your hand.
You may also find some at Alma Park Zoo in Narangba, north of Brisbane
(to quote the TV commercials - Take the Bruce Highway north and follow 
the signs.)

See the separate section below for Koala information.

9.5.3 Tasmanian devils and Tasmanian Tigers [KB]

The Tasmanian Devil population is relatively large and is on the
whole very healthy. There is some problem with a heartworm type
parasite which has (of course) originated from introduced
species.  The government authority is aware of this and are
maintaining close watch and quarrantine on infected groups. It
shouldn't be too great a problem. Tasmanian Devils are a quasi
animal emblem some suggest ambassador for the state so any threat
to their survival is taken very seriously.

A bit about the TD, they do hunt, even climb trees, but generally
prefer to consume carrion aka dead wallabies, livestock, etc.
The TD species appears to one of the few natives that actually
have thrived and increased in population with the arrival of
European man.  Especially now we have a brutally efficient means
of producing carrion aka the motor vehicle which leaves plenty of
road kill for the devils.  We also have the tendency to aggregate
large numbers of live food such as hens and sheep for the devils
to maraude occasionally.

Historically the devils used to follow the now extinct Tasmanian
Tiger.  Looked much more like a large dog actually.The TT was a
notoriously inefficient hunter which just used to lay in wait for
prey and lunge onto them as they passed, normally only managing
to wound them and then tracking the animal until it was so weak
from blood loss etc that it was able to be slaughtered. It is
suggested that the TT would then feed off its kill until the
devils arrived on masse and drove it away. Consequently when
European man arrived with their sheep the TT soon adapted to this
new abunndant and tractable food source and got a reputation for
killing livestock. In my opinion the new settlers own dogs were
much more likey to have killed most of the livestock, they still
do. As history will show the government of the day reacted to the
hysteria about the TT and offered a sizeable bounty for each TT
scalp. The last known TT died in captivity in 1933.

[AT]
Two large marsupial carnivores found their last refuge in Tasmania.  The
Thylacine and the Tasmanian Devil disappeared from mainland Australia
within the last few thousand years probably because of competition with
the Dingo after it was brought to Australia by man.  The Dingo never
reached Tasmania.

The Thylacine's similarity to a large dog is why it was sometimes called
the Tasmanian Wolf, its stripes led to it also being called the Tasmania
Tiger.  Its main prey are thought to have been kangaroos and wallabies.
Alleged predation on sheep led to a long campaign government-funded
persecution but its rapid decline at the start of this century may have
been also caused by disease.  The last known Thylacine died in Hobart
Zoo in the 1930s.  Unsubstantiated sighting still occur, including on
the mainland but many believe the Thylacine is extinct.

The Tasmanian Devil is much smaller - roughly similar in body shape to a
Corgi.  Its prey ranges from invertebrates to mammals larger than
itself.  It prefers carrion which its powerful jaws are well adapted to
consuming.  Tasmanian Devils are not endangered. They occur throughout
Tasmania perhaps in larger numbers than when Europeans arrived.

9.5.4 Venomous Fauna

Australia's array of venomous fauna is unmatched by any other country.
They are *not* a serious concern for tourists.

Red-Back Spider, more commonly known in the U.S. as a Black Widow; it
        is found all over Australia.

The Box Jellyfish or Sea Wasp (Chironex sp.).  The most dangerous
jellyfishes.  Sting produces excruciating pain, respiratory distress,
cardiovascular effects and sometimes death.  Over 70 deaths known. An
antivenom is available but if death occurs it is usually within 10
minutes.  Occurs in shallow coastal waters of northern Australia from
November to April.  Does not affect Great Barrier Reef resort areas.

Blue-ringed Octopus (Hapalochlaena sp.).  The most dangerous octopuses.
Shy inhabitants of reefs and tidal pools.  If handled may bite producing
rapid painless paralysis, breathing difficulties and sometimes death
through suffocation within minutes.  Death unlikely if artificial
respiration supplied.  Few deaths known but likely some undiagnosed.

Inland Taipan/Fierce Snake (Oxyuranus microlepidotus).  Probably most
venomous bite of any land snake.  Found in remote arid areas of inland
Australia.  Average bite injects sufficient venom to kill over 100,000
mice.  Three bites known but no fatalities.  Another ~20 Australian land
snakes are capable of causing death but fatalities uncommon since
antivenoms became widely available.  About 20 sea snakes found in
Australian waters are also capable of causing death but bites rare as
they are normally only encountered by divers and fishermen.

Funnel Web Spider (Atrax sp).  Some of the the most dangerous spiders.
Species occur in variety of habitats around Australia.  Sydney Funnel
Webs are common in some Sydney suburbs.  Since the availability of
antivenom fatalities rare.  A number of other Australian spiders are
dangerous.

Stonefish (Synanceja sp. )  Probably most venomous fish. Well
camouflaged inhabitant of northern Australian reefs.  If stepped on
dorsal spines inject venom causing immense pain.  Death unusual but
symptoms are extreme and long lasting.  Antivenom available but hot
water produces great relief of symptoms.  Many other Australian fish
possess venomous spines but only a few approach the Stonefishes in
potency.  For most species stings are unlikely unless handled.

Cone Shells (Conus sp.) Most dangerous molluscs.  Attractive inhabitant
mainly of water.  Predatory molluscs which can if handled inject a venom
with neuromuscular toxin.  Few Australian fatalities.

Trapdoor Spider
	Not deadly but can still give a nasty bite
Tree Funnel-Web
	Another member of the Sydney variety's Atrax family which can be
	found in northern NSW and Qld, but usually only in rainforests)
Bird-Eating Spider
	Another relative of the funnel-web, and potentially just as
	deadly

Important note for people overseas: There are effective antivenines for
all the dangerous poisonous land creatures in Australia.  The Black Widow in
the US is more dangerous than the Red-Back Spider because there is no
reliable anti-venine in the US.  To my knowledge, the only really
dangerous poisonous creature here for which there is no specific
anti-venine is the Clarence-river Tiger Snake, which can be effectively
treated with normal Tiger Snake anti-venine anyway.

Other Dangerous sea-creatures: Sea Snakes, Sharks, Box Jelly Fish.

Some things to note about the snakes above: The sea-snake has very
short fangs - in fact 5mm wetsuits are effective protection (provided
the snake tries to bite the wetsuit! ;).  Of the land snakes, the most
dangerous is the Taipan, since it will attack unprovoked.  I have seen
all of the snakes above except for the sea snake, and they were all in
more of a hurry to get out of my way than I was to get out of theirs!

I believe in terms of toxicity, the daddy-long-legs spider has a venom
more dangerous than the funnel-web, but doesn't have the fangs or
quantity to actually be dangerous to large animals. 

Can anyone remember a serious attack recently?  The thing with all
poisonous creatures is to treat them with the respect they deserve and
give them a wide berth.  Try killing a Taipan with a shovel and you are
asking for trouble - they can strike across a distance of at least two
metres.  If you're not sure what kind of spider or snake it is, assume
it *is* dangerous, and avoid it anyway.

Only one snake has ever looked like it was going to strike at me - a
small-eyed snake, which as it turns out is not dangerous.  But when it
did - you should have seen me levitate backwards out of it's way! 8^)

Once when walking with a friend in Lamington National Park, she
suddenly stopped.  I walked up and said "What's the problem?".  She
pointed a quivering finger at a snake a few metres away.  "Snake!" she
said.  "Oh, sure.  It's a Tiger Snake,"I replied.  "You didn't *have*
to tell me that!"she said... *laughter* The snake in question was
sunning itself in a patch of sun, and was fast asleep, digesting a
meal.  I doubt it knew we were there.  Spiders and snakes are just
more of nature's beautiful creatures - treat them with respect and
they're not a problem.

9.5.5 Extinct and Endangered Species

The last two hundred years have been disasterous for Australia's mammals
with perhaps as many as 18 species becoming extinct (the status of
several is uncertain).  This is far worse than any other continent.  50
or more years latter it is hard to be certain of the exact causes but
for 16 of the 18 species most think the primary cause was one or more of
three introduced species: cats, rabbits and foxes.  Grazing by domestic
stock may also have affected some species.  For the Thylacine and the
Toolache Wallaby extinction came more directly from hunting.

Many more mammals exist now only as small declining populations or
survive only on tiny offshore islands.  Saving these species will
present great difficulties.

Australia's plants are the other group to have suffered badly in the
last 200 years.  Around 100 species seem to have become extinct and
another 200 of Australia's 20,00 plants are endangered.  A further 3,000
species are placed in the less serious categories of rare, vulnerable or
threatened.  Many plant communities are not adequately conserved.

Australia's birds have fared better.  Only one species has been
lost from mainland Australia - the Paradise Parrot.  Island species
have fared worse with a number of species lost from Norfolk and
Lord Howe islands.  Emu species found only on Kangaroo Island and
King Island have also been lost.

9.5.6 Koalas

There are moves to eliminate the handling of captive Koalas but visitors
who must pet a Koala may wish to try the places below.  Call beforehand
to check.

- Sydney, New South Wales: The Australian Wildlife Park (outside
Sydney). 830-9187. (In USA: 800-423-2880).

- Melbourne, Victoria: Phillip Island Animal Park (two hours
east of Melbourne).

- Brisbane, Queensland: Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary (Fig Tree Pocket);
Bunya Park (in Brisbane).

- Brisbane, Queensland: Gondwana Sanctuary at Southbank in Brisbane also 
allows you to hold koalas and be photographed by them.  

- Canberra, ACT: Rehwinkel's Animal Park about 20 mins drive north of
Canberra (can pet kangaroos and wallabies ? koalas)
Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve, about 30 minutes south of Canberra, 
viewing only but of semi-wild koalas in a natural setting.

- Adelaide, South Australia: Cleland Wildlife Reserve (near Mt. Lofty).
61-8-339-2444. Fax 61-8-370-9623.  Cudlee Creek Wildlife Park (Cudlee
Creek, in the hills outside Adelaide).

- Perth, West Australia: Cohunu Wildlife Park in Caversham, WA, just

9.6 National Symbols

9.6.1 Flag

In vexillogical terms, the Australian flag is a defaced blue ensign.
In the upper hoist (top left corner) is the Union Flag (ie the flag of
the United Kingdom). On the fly (right) of the flag, are 5 white
stars, representing the Southern Cross, a constellation of stars
generally only visible in the southern hemisphere.  Each of these
stars has 7 points except for the smallest star which has only five.

Directly below the Union Flag is a large 7 pointed white star called
the Federation Star, representing the federation of the colonies of
Australia in 1901 to become an independent nation of the British
Commonwealth.  There is one point for each of the six states, and one
to represent all of Australia's internal and external territories.

The length:height ratio of the flag is 2:1.

* History of the Australian Flag

Australia's national flag was chosen from a national flag competition
held in 1901.  Initially started by a Melbourne newspaper, the
competition was taken up by the new Federal Government, and it
attracted 32 823 entries.  Although not a part of the official entry
rules, the judges proscribed that the design *must* contain the Union
Flag.  The winning design was in fact shared by five people who
submitted almost identical entries.  Australia's first Prime Minister,
Edmund Barton, announced the winning design in Melbourne on 3
September 1901.  The design had a mixed reception and caused much
controversy at the time.

The original design was as described above, except the Federation Star
contained only 6 points and the Southern Cross was represented by
stars ranging from 5 to 9 points to indicate their relative apparent
brightness in the night sky.  The design was modified to the current
design on 22 May 1909, but in fact the flag did *not* have official
sanction as Australia's national flag, and wasn't always flown as
such, until the Flags Act of 1953 was passed by the Menzies
Government.

There is some agitation to change the current design to one that does
not include the Union Flag in view of Australia's changing
relationship with Britain.

9.6.2 Coat of arms

[BJ] The Australian Coat of Arms shows a kangaroo (left) and an emu
(right) holding a shield that contains the six state badges (left to
right on first row: NSW, Vic and Qld, below are SA, WA and Tas).
Underneath the shield is a spray of Golden Wattle blossoms,
Australia's floral emblem.  Above the shield is the seven pointed
federation star.

9.7 Miscellaneous

For anyone chasing facts and figures about Australia I would recommend
The Book Of Australia Almanac, "The essential information book on
everything Australian". (524 pages) My copy is the 1991-92 Ed. which
cost me $2 at a sale in Melbourne, so I assume that there is a later
edition out now.  Published by Hodder & Stoughton, 10-16 South St,
Rydalmere, NSW, 2116 [JN]

* Relative sizes of countries.  Before the breakup of the USSR, the
order was: USSR (by far the biggest, more than twice the size of any
other country), then Canada, China, USA (inc. Alaska), Brazil and
Australia, making Australia number 6 in area. That Brazil was slightly
bigger than Oz was a bit of a surprise to me.  I haven't seen the
stats for Russia, but given that in round figures it was something
like 22 for the USSR to 9 for Canada, the order seems unlikely to have
changed. [JH]

* Time Zones. Australia has three basic time zones; Eastern Central
Time (EST) (NSW, Vic, Qld, Tas) GMT+10, Central (SA, NT) GMT+9 1/2,
and the west coast GMT+8.  NSW, SA, Vic, Tas, ACT put their clocks
forward an hour for "Daylight Savings" over the summer.  (WA, Qld, and
the NT do not.  [SW] Queensland had a referendum for Daylight Saving
in 1990 after a trial summer the year before.  Due largely to the
country vote, the referendum failed by something like 53%/47%.)

10.AUSTRALIAN LIFE

10.1 Housing

* Housing in Melbourne [miscellaneous contributors]

There are several kinds of things that you can rent: a unit, an
apartment, a townhouse and a house.  An apartment usually refers to a
dwelling in a multi-story structure.  There is no garden to maintain.
There are more of apartments closer to the city.  A unit is a dwelling
in a single-story structure that is usually connected to its
neighbouring units. There will usually be 3--6 units in a block.  2
bedroom versions of units are the most common starting at about $120
pw. 3 bedroom varieties are available but I do not know the price (I'd
guess about $150 pw).  You can find units all over the city. You might
have a small area of garden to look after.  A townhouse is like a
unit, but free-standing (ie not connected to neighbouring town houses)
and may be a two-story building. I think that the rent is similar to
the unit. You might have a small area of garden to look after.  I
think that you know what a house is. Houses in Melbourne are commonly
either weatherboard or brick veneer. No basement. No attic. 3 bedroom
and 4 bedroom versions are commonly available for rent.

Most areas in the north-western, eastern or sout-eastern areas, within
about 10km of the CBD would be suitable.  Rent would probably be about
A$200 a week depending on the location.  You could expect a 3 bedroom
house on a reasonable block (quarter acre or bit smaller), with a
decent sized backyard.  3 bedroom apartments are uncommon in
Melbourne.

Most of the northern and western suburbs are in general perfectly
safe, but are traditionally poorer areas and the quality of housing is
not good.  Some of them (esp.  Carlton) have been gentrified and are
now very beautiful, but be careful.  There has been a large scale
movement back into the city centres in Australia over the last 20
years, so that the poorer and less safe areas are now generally in the
outer suburbs.  I believe this is different from the US situation, but
it does mean you can have both a nice place to live and a reasonable
commute.

Melbourne has been assessed as the worlds most livable city. You will
not find the crime that you would be used to in Jersey or the crime
that is present in Sydney.  One of the nicer things about Melbourne is
that there's almost nowhere which is genuinely unsavoury to live.
Parts of the city are unsightly and much is visually uninteresting.
The prettier areas are northeast and east.  Southeast gets you the
beaches and west and north is cheaper and more industrial.

There are not really any areas which compare to the slum/ghetto areas
of large US cities. However, of course some areas are "better" than
others.  Very generally, the south east, and eastern suburbs are more
middle class.  The further out you are, the cheaper housing gets. The
really posh areas are Toorak, Brighton. The northern and western
suburbs are more low-middle and working class. Plus there are some
inner city areas that used to be working class but are now pretty
yuppified (Carlton, Fitzroy).  Find somewhere close to a train or tram
line if you are going to commute to the city centre.

* Housing in Sydney [BJ]

Sydney is a big place.  It's population is about 3.7 million,
depending on where you stop counting.  It spreads in every direction
from the CBD (Central Business District) until the sea or mountains
stop it.  Sydney has about 950 suburbs and 40 local government areas
("Councils"), 15 of which are cities in their own right.  Sydney also
has the highest population density in Australia.  Most dwellings
within a 10 km radius of the city centre are apartments, terrace
houses, or townhouses, with a smattering of semis (semi-detached
houses) and detached houses (on blocks of land that would be
considered tiny in other Australian cities) depending upon the suburb.
However, Sydney is generally clean and green, with lots of trees and
parks to compensate.

Outer suburbs and newer suburbs usually consist exclusively of
detached housing, but it is now State Government policy to enforce
higher density housing to contain the urban sprawl, which now sees
Sydney's outer suburbs a 60 kilometre drive from the city centre.

Sydney has by far the most expensive housing in Australia.  Luxury
homes with city and/or harbour views easily command multi-million
dollar price tags to purchase, or cost thousands of dollars a *week*
to rent.  Sydneysiders are obsessed with views and will pay to get
them.  The average price of a 3 bedroom house in Sydney is about
A$230,000, the average price of a 2 bedroom apartment is about
A$160,000, but the variation is enormous depending upon style and
location.  The typical rent is *approximately* 1/1000th of the value
of the dwelling per week.

Sydney's suburbs are generally classified by "area", going clockwise
from the city centre, in the following way:

- Inner City (CBD, Kings Cross, Pyrmont, Ultimo, Surry Hills)
- Eastern (Paddington to Vaucluse and Waverley)
- South Eastern (Kensington to Malabar)
- Southern (Rockdale to Sutherland and Cronulla)
- South Western (Canterbury, Bankstown, Liverpool, Campbelltown)
- Inner West (Glebe and Marrickville to Ashfield)
- West (Croydon to Parramatta)
- Far West (Blacktown to Penrith)
- Blue Mountains (Emu Plains to Katoomba)
- North West (Blacktown to Windsor)
- The Hills (Pennant Hills, Baulkham Hills, Castle Hill)
- Far North (Asquith to Brooklyn)
- Upper North Shore (Lindfield to Hornsby)
- Mid North Shore (St Leonards to Chatswood)
- Lower North Shore (Longueville to Mosman)
- Northern Beaches (Manly to Narrabeen)
- Peninsula (Mona Vale to Palm Beach)

Unlike many American cities, the suburbs closer to the City are
*generally* considered to be more desirable, and those further away,
less desirable, but this is by no means true in all cases.  There is
no widespread inner-city decay in Sydney, in fact it tends to be the
reverse, with many people lovingly restoring old inner city terrace
houses, or moving into expensive new apartment complexes complete with
swimming pools, squash courts and gymnasiums.

Sydney has a large number of Manhattan style residential towers (some
up to 50 floors) in its city centre, unlike Melbourne, which has
virtually none.  It is common for companies repatriating staff to
Australia for extended stays to arrange long term rent of these
apartments, or rent one for two weeks to enable that person to find
their own place to rent after arriving.

The Eastern Suburbs are considered the most prestigious, with City and
Harbour views, closely followed by the rival Northern Suburbs (the
"new money" Lower North Shore, and "old money" Upper North Shore).
Expect to pay big dollars in these areas to buy or rent.  To make life
complicated, there are prestigious areas within otherwise unremarkable
suburbs.  For example, a small part of Strathfield is very prestigious
and houses there command twice the price of other houses less than a
kilometre away.

This geographical snobbery in Sydney is far stronger than in any other
Australian city.  It may not be overt, but it is an undercurrent in
many people's thoughts.  Some in the Eastern Suburbs never dare cross
the harbour to visit the rival Northern Suburbs or vice versa.  Some
think all the cultural unwashed live west of Ashfield.  People who
live in the West hate being stereotyped by the snobs in the East and
North.

Surfies live on the northern beaches, trendies live in the Inner City,
the evangelists live in The Hills, and many suburbs noted for their
high concentration of one particular ethnic culture, whether true or
imagined (South Africans in St Ives, Chinese in Haymarket and
Chatswood, Vietnamese in Cabramatta, Arabs in Lakemba, Italians in
Leichhardt, etc etc).  Sydney is a real patch-work quilt.

* Canberra [TN]

Housing is getting expensive in Canberra.  A median house price
(probably 3-4 bedrooms, ensuite, 2 car garage, 0.2 acres) is about
$160,000, and rents for say $180-200 per week.  That is second only to
Sydney.  However, the medan house price is somewhat misleading as the
standard of the houses is not directly comparablable city to city.
You probably get much more for your money in Canberra than most other
cities, and the housing is newer.

Canberra is organised as a group of towns, where each town has a town
centre, with shopping malls, offices, service districts (specialist
shops, car yards, mechanics etc).  The city is very attractive, well
layed-out, nice parklands, lots of space.  The surrounding mountains
and bush are peaceful and beautiful, and it is only a 10-15 minute
drive from the city to be in genuine bushland.  Lots of virgin forest
and mountains for outdoor enthusiasts, rivers and lakes for canoeing
and fishing.

It's about 1-1.5 hours drive to the coast, and there is some nice
coastline.  Bateman's Bay is the closest and is therefore a bit
overcrowded with Canberrans.  A bit further north or south (say 50km)
gets you to some quiet beaches.  Good camping there too.  A lot of
Canberrans own beach houses.  Sydney is 300 km away on mostly freeway,
close enough for an easy weekend trip.

Jobs tend to be with the government or universities/CSIRO, or
companies that supply these directly or indirectly.  There is a
growing private sector, which has little to do with government.

Culture: some good restaurants if you ask around (as anywhere).  At
least one twin art cinema, plus three or four other cinemas.  More of
the touring cultural events visit Canberra than you would expect
because the population (approx 350,000?) is relatively well off and
educated.  There is a lot of additional culture because it is the
national capital, such as the Australian National Gallery, National
Library, etc.  However, Canberra is not like Sydney or Melbourne in
terms of choice or frequency of cultural events, or venues.

Canberra has two universities, Aust National Uni and Canberra Uni.

10.2 Schooling

Schools are Prep,1-6 (primary) and 7-12 (secondary or high school),
except 
- in WA, where primary school is years 1 to 7, and secondary school is
years 8 to 12. [AW];
- in Qld where there is no equivalent to Prep unless you send your
kids to Kindergarten / Pre-School (optional), and primary ranges from
1-7, Secondary is 8-12.
- in Catholic Schools in SA:prep-5 junior, 6-9 middle 10-12/13 senior.
This is often internal and many parish primary schools extend up to
year 7 for the parents who want to send their kids to a state school
for high school. [KW]

Attending school is compulsory until the age of 16.

The school year goes from the end of January or first part of Feb.
until the middle of December.  There are school holidays between each
term.  The school year has 4 terms (3 in Tasmania) with a week off at
Easter, 2 weeks in July (winter), 2 weeks at the end of Sept. or first
of October.

Most schools have uniforms - public and private.

[KW] In South Australia whilst all schools have uniforms State,
schools do not and cannot make it compulsory to wear them.  My
understanding of other states is that it is the same there.  What will
often happen however is that kids are encouraged to wear the colours
of the uniform.  Most wear the correct colours but never the actual
uniform, with the exception is that many girls do wear their summer
uniform.  With private school, you either wear it or don't come to
school anymore!!

* State vs Private

The majority of australian children attend State schools.  No actual
figures, but it appears the number of children attending private
schools is on the increase. One person thought this was leading to the
closing down of many state schools, however this may also be due to
falling overall enrollment due to lower birthrates.

Private schools fall into different categories. The majority of
private schools are Catholic, and often do not cost much, being
subsidised by the church. The others are called "Independent" schools,
which usually means they have affiliations with some protestant
religion.  The top independent schools are very expensive and very
prestigious, but there are a range of independent school with less
prestige and less expensive.

Geelong Grammar, where Prince Charles went for a year, is known as the
Eton of Australia.

Parents send their children to private schools for a number of
reasons: parents perceive they will get a better education; there will
be more discipline; children are more likely to get into the "top"
courses at university (Law, Medicine, Economics/Commerce); religious
education; better teachers.

It is true that private schools can and do suspend or expel students,
whereas this is almost impossible from a State school, because the
government is obligated to educate everyone up to the age of 16.  As
to the other factors, some research has shown that the overriding
predictor of educational success for a child is the parents' social
class and their education aspirations for the child. It has also been
shown that tertiary students from State high schools do better at
University than students with similar entrance marks.

A common perception is that anyone who afford it will send their child
to a private school, but there are actually many people who believe in
State education (my parents, for example [AN]).

* Completing High School

Each state has a different system for completing high school and
university entrance, and many states have changed the system in recent
years.

Victoria's old HSC has been replaced by the VCE (Victorian Certificate
of Education), done over years 11 and 12. Students are required to do
English, Australian Studies and a certain number of other units. Each
unit is assessed internally by CATs (Common Assessment Tasks). [Are
they going to bring back external exams? AN].

In South Australia it is still called Matriculation but is very
different to the old external exam system.  The new system involves
splitting topics into uni entrance and non-uni entrance.  Eg Chem is
uni entrance but typing isn't.  I think you get two years to do it and
then in year 13 can repeat some topics if you like to improve the
grade.  To get into uni you must take at least 5 uni entrance topics.
If you take more the best 5 are taken to give your entrance score.
The marks are out of 20 so you get an entrance score out of 100.  This
is not the whole picture by far but it is what the kids applying for
uni must do. [KW]

[SW]  Queensland had the dubious TE (Tertiary Entrance) Score until the
late 80's/early 90's when it was replaced by the Student Profile. As I 
understand it, both systems are under a shroud of mystery as to exactly
how they work. 

[Any recent high school grad's or secondary teachers care to comment ?]

10.3 Public Transport

* Melbourne

Public transport isn't great.  If you work in the city and live near a
train, tram or bus line, it is OK for commuting.  You will probably
want a car for shopping etc.  The central suburbs of Melbourne
(including most of the above) are serviced by trams.  These are a
cheap and effective way of getting to work.  Trains also service the
entire metropolitan area, _but_ the lines radiate into the central
city.

* Sydney [BJ]

By Australian standards the public transport in Sydney is excellent.
By international standards, it's probably pretty average.

By far the largest people mover is the electric train system.  A quite
extensive network of lines criss-crosses the City and outlying areas,
with approximately 290 railway stations (10 underground) and 1700
kilometres of tracks.  The system only goes underground in the CBD and
Eastern Suburbs.  Nearly one million passenger trips are made each
day.  The only areas not served by trains are the Northern
Beaches/Peninsula (although plans are being considered to remedy this)
and the Northwest.

The trains are generally frequent (2-10 min at peak times), on time,
clean and fast.  If you live near a train station it is certainly the
easiest way to go to the city.  Driving into the city is actively
discouraged with extremely high parking fees, up to A$40 per day.
Trains are moderately effective for going from suburb to suburb.  A
variety of single/return trip, periodical and regional tickets are
available.

The train system used to run 24 hours a day until 1988, when 1-4 am
services were replaced by buses (ostensibly as a safety measure, but
really a cost- cutting one).  The State Government runs a fast and
frequent bus service in areas without trains, or as connecting
services to train stations.  Timetables are usually coordinated.  Some
services run 24 hours a day.  Again, many types of tickets are
available.  For infrequent travellers, the "TravelTen" ticket (a
no-expiry-date ten trip card) is the best value.  In the outer
suburbs, the only bus services are privately run and fairly expensive.
Most people will drive their car to a railway station and park in the
commuter car parks instead.

Probably the most pleasant way imaginable to travel to work is by
ferry.  Harbourside suburbs are well served with regular State
Government run ferries and connecting bus routes.  The Manly ferry
trip is internationally known.  New services have been recently
introduced to serve suburbs further up the harbour with high speed
catamaran type ferries ('JetCats').  JetCats also run to Manly.

Finally, Sydney has a 4 kilometre, 7 station Monorail loop running
between Darling Harbour and the City.  The majority of users are
tourists, with the rest commuters, mostly using it as a shuttle
between their company sponsored parking spaces at Darling Harbour and
the City.

* Brisbane [SW]

Queensland Rail has a fast efficient suburban train system.  Services
generally run from 5am till midnight with half hourly services during
non peak periods that go to 10-15 minutes apart during peak.  There
are 7 main 'lines', 4 to the north and 3 to the south/southwest.  At
least 90% of the suburban trains are air-conditioned electric trains.
There are still a few diesel hauled.  Basically all trains travel
through the three inner city stations covering Fortitude Valley,
Central (Central Downtown) and Roma Street (Northern Downtown).
Trains are usually on time.  Safety on the trains during daylight
hours is almost guaranteed.  Even at night it's pretty good (I've
never felt threatened) but there are security guards roaming the
trains randomly at night).

Brisbane City Council also operates a pretty good bus service.
Train/Bus connections can get you almost anywhere.

10.4 Roads

* Sydney [BJ]

Roads in Sydney are a mixed bag.  Some are atrociously potholed or
rough, simply buckling under the sheer pounding of thousands of cars
and trucks each day.  Others (such as the new privately run Tollways)
are extremely smooth, fast, and beautifully landscaped (some call them
'yuppieways').

There are seven main arterial links in Sydney called "Metroroads".
These roads follow a freeway or tollway if there is one, or the
largest main route (usually 6 lanes) if there isn't.  They are
excellently signposted and the route number is indicated by a single
digit in a white hexagon.

There are five radial links into the city centre, namely Metroroads
1,2,4 and 5.  M1 runs from north to south and goes right through the
CBD (actually through the Harbour Tunnel), and so forms a link in each
direction.  There are also two ring links (Metroroads 3 and 7), with
M3 at a radius of about 10 km from the CBD, and M7 about 20 km.  M6
doesn't exist yet.

Away from the Metroroads are State Roads.  These are main roads that
form feeders to the Metroroads, are usually at least 4 lanes, and are
also generally well signposted.  Route numbers are indicated by a 2 or
3 digit number in a blue shield.

Away from State Roads, you're in suburban territory.  Signposting is
optional.  Take your street directory.

* Canberra [TN]

Canberra has very good schools, roads, services etc.  Your day to day
life is without many of the hassles of bigger cities.  The traffic is
light (except for peak 10-minutes, rather than peak-hour), and most
main roads are devoted to being roads, and don't have houses, shops
etc on them (this makes it safer for bicyclists and motorcycles).
This can make Canberra look empty to the uninitiated.

10.5 Prices [1993]

These are averages, and there are significant variations.

  1 litre of Milk                              $1
  1 loaf of bread                              $1.25
  1 kilo of minced [Ground] Beef               $5
  1 pair of Levis' 501s                       $70
  1 one trip intracity bus ticket              $2
  1 monthly bus pass                          $60
  the daily paper                              $0.60
  the cheapest brand new Toyota Corolla    $17000
  1 five year old smaller Japanese car
    with 80000 KM on it                     $7000
  1 museum pass                                $6
  one month's rent on a 2 bedroom apartment:
    VERY location-dependent, ranging from $300 to $1500, average ~= $800.

Assuming petrol is at 72c/l, and an ecxhange rate of US$ -> AUS$ of
$0.66, this puts a petrol cost of $1.72/gallon. (that is US$ and US
gallons). [IS]

[JM] Last week [Sept 93] a newspaper article appeared describing a
survey of the cost of living in a number of countries.  It appeared to
be aimed at companies trying to establish a suitable living allowance
for their employees when posted overseas.  The survey indicates that
Australia is the cheapest of a sample of ten countries.  I have
reproduced the results published below:

                        Mar 92          Mar 93
                        ======          ======
        Japan           234.60          271.70
        Russia          170.10          189.90
        Sweden          199.30          167.10
        China           140.10          150.30
        Germany         138.00          146.40
        Singapore       129.10          138.30
        Hong Kong       127.50          136.00
        USA             107.70          114.70
        UK              122.90          110.10
        Australia       100.00          100.00

(I suspect the figures have been normalised to show Australia at $100
in each case.  This removes the effects of inflation in Australia -
which is low anyway - and currency fluctuations of the Australian
dollar against the others.)

The survey is based on a basket of goods including food, stamps,
laundry, cinema tickets, hair styling, clothing, electrical goods,
restaurant meals and drinks at a bar.  It excludes mortgages and cars.
I don't know if it includes rent, but it is possible to rent 3 bedroom
houses in the Melbourne suburbs for about $150/week.  (In relatively
good, but not expensive or inner suburban areas.  However, it depends
on what you are looking for, a "quality executive" style home will
cost you considerably more.)

The survey was prepared by Employment Conditions Abroad.  The local
spokesman is a Dr. Peter Rogers of Pacific Personnel.  (Phone 03 - 329
8352, fax 03 - 328 3489) I suspect they are a consulting company and
the full report will cost you a fair bit.

* A note on costs in Sydney

[HG] From "The Sydney Morning herald" (reproduced without permission) Sep 94.

"Sydney cheap for food, dearer for transport" - Sydney citizens slave for 11
minutes to earn enough money to buy a kilogram of their daily bread, while the
residents of Caracas toil for two hours for the same sustenance.

"Prices and Earning Around the Globe", the Union Bank of Switzerland's latest
analysis of international purchasing power, contains many comparisons to make
Sydneysiders puff with pride. But other statistics will leave them envious of
greener grass. 

The bank analysed prices, wages and working hours in 53 cities around the world
in the second quarter of this year and updated its international economic
indicator - the Big Mac index.

It takes 26 minutes for a Sydney worker to earn enough money to buy a Big Mac
and a large serving of French fries. To save for this save repast, a worker in
Chicago need only work for 14 minutes while a Londoner must labour for 36
minutes. But to afford this Mac meal in the Nigerian capital of Lagos, an
average wage-earner would have to work for 11 hours.

Sydney was the 12th cheapest city for overall food prices. A range of 39 food
and beverage items which cost $354.30 in Sydney was $1,268.46 in Tokyo.

For prices excluding rents, Sydney was only the 32nd most expensive city
surveyed. Tokyo was the most expensive followed by Lagos (mostly because of
high inflation and a currency pegged to the US dollar), Oslo, Zurich, Geneva,
Copenhagen and Singapore.

The cities with the lowest cost of living were Johannesburg, Budapest, Caracas,
Bombay, Prague and Nairobi.

Workers in Switzerland, Denmark and Japan earned the most in gross hourly
wages, with Sydney's employees 23rd on that list. Sydney secretaries earned
$28,939.22 gross per annum, more than their counterparts in London ($24,882.32)
and Toronto ($23,665.25). But a Genevan secretary earned $60,583.

It is not only the secretaries who are well-paid in Switzerland. The average
gross annual income of Sydney's bus drivers, $21,636.80, compares with $63,693
for Genevan bus drivers. But it was favourable in comparison with the
$14,875.30 earned by those in Singapore.

For passengers, it cost $2.40 to take public transport 10 kilometres or 10
stops in Sydney while New Yorkers only paid $1.70. The same trip cost $4.11 in
Copenhagen. 

Those who preferred to drive paid $19,878.81 for a popular four-door car in
Sydney while the average American paid $17.444.67. But spare a thought for
drivers in Singapore, who paid $74,106.04 for a Mitsubishi Lancer because of
high taxes aimed at curbing traffic.

Monthly rent for a medium-priced three-room flat averaged $581 in Sydney while
New Yorkers paid $1256 and Hong Kong residents paid $1,540. Johannesburg
landlords only expected $230 each month.

And for fashion victims, a medium-priced selection of women's clothes - dress,
jacket, skirt and shoes - cost Japanese women $2,582.89 while their Sydney
sisters faced a retail therapy bill of $581.49. The same look cost only $486.83
in Los Angeles and $459.78 in London.

Some locations (e.g. Queen Street Mall) are partially open on Sunday.

10.7 Crime

* Sydney [BJ]

The crime in Sydney is often overstated.  Yes, there are parts in
which it is unwise to walk alone at night.  On the other hand,
allegedly dangerous areas like Kings Cross are often quite safe
because it is always crowded 24 hours a day and heavily patrolled by
Police on foot.  Just don't start a fist fight there :-) Overall,
Sydney is really a very safe city for its size if you use your common
sense and avoid obvious dangers.  At night, travel with someone else
if you are unsure, or at least look like you're *not* unsure if alone.

On trains, sit in populated carriages near the Guards Carriage
(indicated by a blue light on the side) if you're worried.  Transit
Police patrol trains and this has greatly increased safety at night.
Sydney also has a chapter of the NYC "Guardian Angels" riding
nighttime trains.  At train stations at night, wait in the well lit
striped areas of the platform.  Major stations have 24 hour video
surveillance and large red "Emergency Help" buttons on the platforms
that immediately summons the Police should you be in trouble.
Sydney's nighttime trains are 4 carriages long, but now they lock the
first 2, so you have to sit near the guard.  They've painted "Night
Safe Area" on the platforms where the unlocked carriages stop. [RA]

Buses are generally safe at any hour, and incidents on Ferries and the
Monorail are rare.

Always lock you car when leaving it, even at a petrol station, and
never leave *anything* on view in the car that isn't bolted down or
welded to it.  Especially do not leave anything valuable, a wallet,
handbag, or spare change on view.  Cars are broken into for $2 or an
umbrella (really - it happened to my wife!).  Also, don't leave a
Street Directory on the seat.  It looks like you're visiting an
unfamiliar area, and hence will be away from your car for some time.

10.8 Sport

* Australian Rules Football 

This is the main football code played in Vic, SA, WA and Tasmania.
The Australian Football League consists of 10 teams based in
Melbourne, plus Geelong, Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. (It was
established a few years ago from an expanded VFL.) Fixtures, results,
statistics and match reports are available from
rec.sport.football.australian. Pre-season night competition begins the
end of February. Main season is end of March to August, with finals
series in September. West Coast won in 1992, Essendon won the flag in
1993.  (Carn the Ds in '94!  [AN] :-).

There is a competition of about 8 women's teams in Melbourne, but the
sport does not seem to be growing.

(If it isn't obvious, Melbourne is the home of this "sport".
Melbourne's winter football mania is one great reason NOT to be there
in winter! [CP, who probably still has cleat marks on his back from
his school days] :-P.)

* Rugby

The main football code in NSW and Qld is rugby. Rugby League is the
professional sport (reigning premiers are the Brisbane Broncos, who
beat St. George 14-6 this year), rugby union is still "amateur".
Rec.sport.rugby contains some postings about rugby in Australia
(though is dominated by discussion of the rugby union 5 nations
competition and the World Cup).

For the 1995 season, the current 16 team format is expanding to 20
teams.  The 4 expansions teams are the Auckland (NZ) Warriors,
Queensland Crushers (could be South Queensland, not sure), the ???
Cowboys (based in Townsville, could either be named Townsville or
North Qld) and a team from Perth.  The draw is becoming a Conference
style draw like the NFL in the US.

Women's rugby in Australia is still in it's infancy (we did not send a
team to either the 1991 or 1994 World Cups), but in 1994 the rugby
union championship was held for the 3rd year, and the number of
Australian teams competing increased from 4 to 14, plus one from NZ.
Christchurch beat the ACT in the final 13-5. The first test between NZ
and Australia will take place in September 1994.

[SW] Rugby League is played by girls up to age 12 or 13 in both
schools and weekend competition in mixed teams with boys. I believe
that after that age they are no longer allowed to play mixed.
However, I did see an article on Wide World of Sports on Channel 9 in
August 1993 depicting a Rugby League for Women Grand Final out of
Sydney.

* Cricket 

The most widespread summer sport is cricket. Australia plays regulars
Tests against England (for the Ashes), NZ, India, the West Indies,
Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and now that they have been re-admitted to the
fold, South Africa.  Each summer there are two touring teams which
play in a 3-way One-Day series.  The state competition is for the
Sheffield Shield (4-day matches), which is only semi-professional.
(Qld has never won this :-).  Many men and boys play club cricket on
the weekends (usually Saturday).

Women's cricket has been established quite a long time (first Test
versus England in 1934) but continues to be a minority sport for
women. There are about 100 club sides in Melbourne. The Australian
women's team is the best in the world; I believe there has even been
some TV coverage of Test and/or One-day cricket recently.

Note: live commentary of cricket matches is available via IRC
(Internet relay chat). It is available on the channel #cricket and
people discuss the match on #crickettalk. Information on this is
posted regularly to rec.sport.cricket. There is a cricket information
service, called CricInfo, available on gopher - see rec.sport.cricket
also for how to access it.

* Baseball

There is the ABL (Australian Baseball League). It is only 3-5 years
old.  There are 8 teams - Brisbane, Gold Coast, Sydney, 2 from
Melbourne, Adelaide, Waverley and Perth. The season consists of 14
games of regular season played in January and February of each year.
The Brisbane Bandits won the competition in 1994. [SW]

* Basketball

NBL consists of 14 teams (although Hobart Tassie Devils might not
play in 1994 because of financial problems).  Season is usually
from March/April until September. Each team is only allowed 2
imports (i.e. non Australian citizens). NBL was created in the
late 70's and has expanded since then, with several of the
original teams either leaving or being renamed/relocated. [SW]

* Athletics

* Horse Racing

Is everywhere. Traditionally Australians love to gamble. The Melbourne
Cup is the biggest race of the year. There is a holiday for it in
Melbourne.  For a few minutes on the Tuesday after the first Monday in
November the whole country stops to listen (supposedly).  Work place
sweeps proliferate. Phar Lap, which won the Melbourne Cup in 1930, is
a national hero, and his stuffed body may be seen in the Melbourne
musuem.

* Netball

There are over 1/2 million registered netball players in Australia, so
it is by far the most popular women's sport.

* Softball

Is the most popular women's summer sport.

* Soccer

[contributions? AN]

* Other Sports.

Field hockey is very popular for both men and women, and we do well in
International competition. Many people play squash.  Other sports
played include badminton, volleyball, table tennis, yachting, rowing,
swimming, cycling... [any more? AN]

11.TRAVEL

11.1 Money 

* transferring Money Australia <-> UK

Banks will accept sterling cheques, they just take longer to clear (2
weeks).  [Cost? AN]

[JC] To open any bank account you must prove your identity to a total
of 100 points, over a number of items e.g. passport 40?, driver's
licence (I do not know whether a UK licence is sufficent*), rent
notice, etc.

*You should be able to get an Australian licence with a valid UK
licence plus a road rules test + money.

All of the 'big four' banks i.e. Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA),
National Australia (NAB), ANZ and Westpac have a nationwide branch
network, with very wide ATM access.  You can use Commonwealth and
Westpac cards at the other's ATMs.  Similarly for NAB and ANZ.  There
are a number of smaller regional banks e.g. Advance, St George, which
havelinkages to nationwide ATM networks.

Transferring money UK <-> OZ should not be a serious problem. However,
ensure that you give very clear instructions as to where you want the
money placed.  I have tried transferring money to UK via telegraphic
transfer (where the UK bank charged to deposit it.), and by taking a
banker's draft in the currency of the destination country.  The latter
path works if you have taken sufficient cash (always more than your
estimate!) to survive until you can open an account and have the draft
credited to it.  If you want to make smaller, regular transfers
telegraphic transfer may be more relevant.

The Commonwealth Bank announced recently that they will support CIRRUS
both ways i.e for overseas travellers and for Australians overseas.
We got into a money hole in UK, and get close to making withdrawals
from our Australian account, even though we *thought* we had
sufficient cash for the initial cost 'hump'. CIRRUS offers a useful
backup.

There are low bank charges for business accounts.  Most of the 'big
four' will charge heavily for operating a cheque i.e. current account
but will give interest on savings accounts which can be linked to the
cheque account at the ATMs.  All of the 'big four' have branches in
London.

[JS] The easiest way to transfer money between Australia and any other
country is to deposit it into a credit card, and withdraw it on the
other end.  There's no fee, and the exchange rate is as good as you'll
get most places. Check with your credit card agency to make sure this
will be OK, just in case.

[SW] My brother did just this for a holiday to the US.  Dumped money 
on the credit card to give him a 'positive' balance and spent it in
the US by charging.

Regarding banks, in my experience Australia's banks are far more
user-friendly than UK banks. The last time I used UK banks was eight
years ago; they may have changed. Due to the mergers and interbank
links there's not much to choose from between them, and all have ATM
access and branches across Australia. I recommend choosing one that
has a convenient branch in the UK; that's the biggest factor that is
likely to affect you.

[MJ] I also received generally rotten service from Wespac over the
years.  The quality of this was about on a par with the (also lousy)
service my parents received from the Commonwealth. At least, this was
what I thought until I came to Britain. The level of incompetence and
rudeness, the patronising attitude of the employees, and a failure to
come to grips with technology that I have seen banking with Barclay's
over here have astonished me.
	
One general comment about banking in Australia. As a consequence of
deregulation in the 1980s, Australia now has many smaller and younger
banks in addition to the big four and the state banks. Many of these
are former building societies that have turned into banks. Generally,
these provide service of higher quality than do the larger and older
banks. (For instance, friends of mine who bank with the Advance Bank
and St George Bank (both in NSW) have told me very good things about
them). Their disadvantage is that being smaller, their branch networks
are not nearly as large (usually being concentrated in one
state/geographical area). On the other hand, most financial
institutions (smaller banks, building societies, credit unions) in
Australia other than the large banks have pooled their ATMs together
to form a single network comparable in size to those of the larger
banks.  Thus, at least from the point of view of basic access to your
money, the lack of branches is not that big a disadvantage.

* transferring money from Aus to the US [BJ]

- Write a cheque and post it. Takes time to clear, and there may be
bank service fee and the exchange rate may be bad.
- Bank draft: cost A$8-A$12.
- Wire transfer: cost A$30.
- Use my bank card (ATM card) issued by bank in the other country and
withdrawn straight from my chequing account.  This doesn't work on all
teller machines though...
- Draw money on credit card and pay off straight away.

* Credit cards in Australia

Almost everyone in Australia takes Bankcard, MasterCard and Visa.
Someone mentioned a few places that only take Bankcard, and also
suggested that a few don't take Visa.

[AT] I'd forget travellers cheques and use credit cards wherever
possible.  VISA and MasterCard almost universal, Amex and Diners
widely accepted.  You can get cash advances on VISA, Mastercard and
Amex at many ATM's and for VISA and Mastercard across the counter at
all banks.  You can also use Cirrus and Plus sytem ATM cards at many
ATMs.  ANZ Bank ATMs accept Cirrus and Plus, Commonwealth Bank accepts
Cirrus and State Bank takes Plus.  Using cards will in general get you
a better exchange rate and you avoid the additional fees which the
banks charge to cash travellers cheques.
 
* Travellers cheques

These are not commonly used as currency in Australia.  Thomas Cook and
American Express have offices in major cities, or you can change them
at banks.

[SW] I took in a Japanese exchange student in 1991 and she brought over
several hundred dollars in travellers cheques.  Everywhere she went to
buy stuff accepted them, as long as she had her passport.,

* Visa

All visitors to Australia need visa, except for Australian and New
Zealand nationals.


11.2 Jet-lag

Different people have different strategies for trying to reduce the
effects of jet-lag. Here is a compilation of suggestions:

- Get a good night's sleep before the flight so you are rested.
- No binges on the night before, or specially heavy meals.
- Carry spare underwear and wash kit on plane. Change, wash face and
shave and brush teeth shortly before arrival at destination.
- Eat lightly and drink lots of liquids on the flight, but no
caffeinated drinks (coke!) until the later part of the flight. Avoid
heavy meals - airline dinners are a lot more sensible today than when
I started flying. I have a standing order for veggie meals when I fly
long distance. No booze unless you can limit it to one or two cans or
glasses. Alcohol and caffeine are diuretics which will drain you.
- Sleep or doze as much as you can. It doesn't seem to matter whether
it is real sleep or not. A blindfold often helps. A neck cushion helps.
- On arrival, get a shower ASAP. Have another before supper if you
want.  Eat lightly during the day, but let yourself go in the evening.
Get to bed at a reasonable time, but try not to sleep during daylight
hours. The next morning the body clock should be 99% hoodwinked.
- Exercise (a run or whatever) from the second day on also helps things.
- Carbohydrate loading on the day or two before the flight, with extra
protein on the day of the flight, may also reduce the effects of jet

11.3 Responses to 3 questions      

These 3 questions were posted at one stage. Here are a summary of
answers.

1. How are the conditions of the streets (or roads?) in Australia
in January?  I heard that the roads in the North are often
overflowed. Is this right?

2. We want to rent a car (or jeep or motor home) to go through
Australia.  Which kind of car is required or recommended
(especially for the desert in the center of Australia)?

3. Maybe we want to fly within Australia. Which airlines are
recommended and how much are the prizes (examples are enough)?

Answers (1) 

Roads are O.K. around here - but I live in Sydney :- I don't know
about the roads up north because I have never been there..

I've never heard of roads being overflowed, unless you mean
flooded (with water). This has happened over the last couple of
summers in the northern tropics, but roads are generally only cut
for a few days.  If you want to travel north, it is usually best
to do that May to November when it is dry and travel south
September to April. [FS]

The monsoon hits the far north of australia, so the roads may be
flooded and only usable by boats. however this only is a problem
north of Townsville in queensland and around darwin in the
Northern Territory the rest of the country is in summer HOT and
dry for the most part but its is much colder in the southern
parts and you may have some rain down there...  IT IS A BIG PLACE
and spands a large part of the earth!! [FW]

The term 'condition' usually implies whether they are good for
driving on or not.  The term 'streets' usually means the roads in
the cities.  The term 'roads' usually refers to the highways,
etc.  So, to answer your question: they are generally in a good
condition to drive on (the government has spent a lot of money
lately fixing up the roads).  I'm not sure where you mean exactly
when you say 'north' since there is a lot to the north half of
Australia (covering three states and many thousands of
kilometres).  If you mean Queensland (North East) then the roads
are usually busy with holiday travellers.  If you mean Northern
Territory (North Central of Australia) then the roads are usually
busy before Christmas (although there are still a number of
people about on the roads).  If you mean in Western Australia
(North West) then you will find a lot of outback, very few
people, few roads, and few cars.  I think you mean Northern
Territory ? [IC]

No worries. Stay on the highways and you'll have no problems. It
often rains a bit, but it is rare these days to have major
holdups. But don't go off on to unsealed roads. [RC]

Almost every area in Australia is accessible by any car. That is,
as long as you stay on the bitch (bitumen) you can go anywhere.
If you really want to go off the beaten track you will need a
4WD, but I've never owned one and I've never felt that I've
missed anything. If you want a cheap form of accommodation that
you can take almost anywhere, hire a motor home. If you can
afford the outlay, and you are staying long enough, the cheapest
way by far is to buy something civilised and semi reliable, then
sell it before you go (you could pick up a half decent mid range
car for A$3-4,000. [FS]

Unless you have driven a four wheel drive (4WD) in sand/mud
before then stick to a conventional car/motor home they are
cheaper and you will probably not have enough time to spend
exploring the rougher areas. If you want to see a sight that is
only available by 4WD then there is probably a tour that will
get you there and back for less trouble than hireing a 4WD. [FW]

I would recommend a four-wheel drive vehicle for driving around
through the desert in the centre of Australia.  A motor-home will
probably slow you down and use up a lot more petrol, a jeep will
probably mean you will get sunburnt very easy. [IC]

A bloody big one mate.! Rent a car, Ford or Holden from a
reputable company, with air conditioning. Stay in motels and
hotels. Don't leave the main roads, and even then, carry a 15ltr
can of water if you go more than 200 km inland from any city on
the coast. Travel with other vehicles in convoy if you can
arrange it. Does this sound bad? keep in mind that there are only
17 million people in Oz, and most of those live in Melbourne,
Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide, then Darwin.  That doesn't
leave many to spread out over a country that is the size of
Europe, plus England, plus lower Medetranian etc. Try it on a
map.  It can be many days between passing cars in central
Australia, and if you are broken down, you MUST stay with your
vehicle.  My advice ? See Australia by bus tour, the only way to
go unless you are prepared to face the last frontier and all the
hardships that that entails.  And wear a hat. The temperature can
be 40+ C in the shade. [RC]

I never fly when going on holidays in Australia. This is because
everything is so spread out. You fly somewhere then you have to hire a
car to get out and see something, unless you want to ride on a sheep
truck (tourist bus). Also when you fly you miss out on all the good
things in between major centres where the airports are built. [FS]

You should arrange this as part of your air ticket to australia as it
will be cheaper than buying the air tickest here.  All of the
australian air lines are very good one of the best safety records in
the world sometimes the service may not be the best but its a lot
better than some of the service I have had in other parts of the
world.  Basicly pick out what you want to see ask where it is, there
may be a number of sites eg desert, we have about 5, sandy, stony etc
then plan your trip it would take 4 days to cross the country east
west 3 days to cross north south by fast car, with no stops for sight
seeing... [FW]

[IC] I presume you are not going to book these flights until you get
to Australia (so you can ask around and get the best price at the
time).  However, the problem with this may be that many airlines will
be heavily booked and getting a flight during the holiday season in
Australia may take some time.

Unfortunately, a local airline company (called Compass) went broke for
the second time and a lot of really cheap flights within Australia
have gone. There are 3 main local airlines now are Ansett, East-West
Airlines and Qantas, previously the government owned international
carried, merged with Australian Airlines, the government owned
domestic carrier. The fleet is being repainted in Qantas colours.

I don't have any actual information handy,so I am guessing here and
these are my own approximate guesses (Prices in Australian Dollars):

* Sydney - Perth.  This is a long trip. Probably $700 - $900
Apparently it is cheaper to fly to New Zealand than to fly to Perth
from Sydney.
* Sydney - Darwin Approximately $400
* Darwin - Perth Approximately $600
* Flights to Tasmania (or is going by ship better?)  If you don't
think you'll get sea sick, then a ship (from Melbourne) will probably
end up being cheaper.

I have from a paper some exact figures from Melbourne:- (This is
Ansett Airlines and the price is for a return ticket).

	Melbourne <-> Sydney    $179
	Melbourne <-> Adelaide  $189
	Melbourne <-> Canberra  $199
	Melbourne <-> Brsisbane $289
	Melbourne <-> Perth     $419
	Melbourne <-> Cairns    $489

Another paper I have quotes this price (it is a 17 day package) :-
* Darwin <-> Perth (Aeroplane and Bus) 17 days $3973
  [includes hotel accommodation, plane, bus fares and most meals]

11.4 Travel Reports and Recommendations

11.4.1 Australia from south to north [JO]

This gives some comments on travel in Australia.
I have some definite biases and will admit them as appropriate.
Also, I am assuming that the reader has an atlas with maps of
Australia and New Zealand.

My biases:
- I don't like large cities, deserts or rainforests.
- I do like small cities, mountains, beaches and seacoasts.
- I think that the US and Canada have some of the most beautiful
scenery and interesting cities in the world.  Australia needs your
money and I would love to meet you but honesty compels me to say you
should see the US and Canada first.

I have never seen Adelaide or Western Australia so make no comments.
Also note that Australia is large.  You will need to fly unless you
like long train or bus trips.  Don't plan on intercity driving.  The
roads are poor and there is nothing like the US interstate highway
system.

Hobart in Tasmania is a small but very nice city.  It has a beautiful
harbour, steep hills and some very good seafood restaurants and a
colony of artists and craft workers.  (San Francisco in miniature).  It
is a popular tourist area for Australians but most overseas visitors
miss it.  Tasmania itself is popular with Australians because it is
very different from the mainland.  Cooler and wetter, greener and has
more trees and some heavily forested low mountains.  People from the
eastern or northwest US would probably not see much point in visiting
it.  If you are from the plains or southwest US than it will be
different from home.

Melbourne - Sydney and Melbourne have a long standing feud (like San
Franciso and Los Angeles).  Its a nice city if you like cities of 3
1/2 million.  It does have a beautiful art gallery with a good
collection, some lovely parks, and a number of wildlife preserves
nearby in the Dandenong mountains.  It also has a good public
transport system of trams (streetcars) which are fun to ride.  There
are a lot of good restaurants and I think there is an "Eating Out in
Melbourne" guide book which is supposed to be reliable.  Eating in the
major hotels is a recipe for bankruptcy. (Just like the US.)

Sydney - Its slightly bigger than Melbourne, suffers from a horrible
urban sprawl, driving is terrible (no freeways) but there is good bus
and train service.  The harbour and Opera House are just as beautiful
as you have heard.  There are harbour ferries which are fun to ride.
The ferry service has several guided tours of the harbour which are
relatively inexpensive and worth the time.  The Opera House also has
guided tours. There is an historical area near the harbour called "The
Rocks" which is fun to wander through. Note that down here anything
older than 100 years is "historical.  My unimaginative but practical
suggestion is that the best way to see Sydney is to take one of the
bus tours like Grayline.  They all go to the same places .  There is a
public zoo (Taronga Park) which can be reached by ferry.  That is the
easy way to see koalas and kangaroos.  There is also a "Koala Park"
that I've never been to. I think its included in many of the sight
seeing tours.  Sydney also has an "Eating Out" guide and plenty of
good restaurants of all nationalities.  It lacks chains such as
Denny's or Sizzlers but the take away snack bar food is fairly good.
Not gourmet but they won't poison you.

Outside Sydney, the major tourist area is the Blue Mountains.  They
are not high (1500 meters/5000 feet) but are scenic. If you like
caves, try the Jenolan caves near Katoomba in the Blue Mountains.
There are coach tours from Sydney to the Blue Mountains and the caves.
Alternatively, take a train to Katoomba (2 hours, $8) and than catch
one of the coach tours there.  I believe the railroad organises this.
You might want to stay one or two nights.  There are plenty of good
motels.  I can also recommend the train trip to Wollongong as very
scenic but then I am biased since I live there!

The Whitsunday Islands: Now we jump 1500 km to central Queensland.
The Whitsunday Islands are a group of small, semi-tropical islands at
about 20S latitude.  You may be able to find the largest (Whitsunday
Island of course) in an atlas.  The nearest towns are Bowen and
Proserpine.  Two islands, Hamilton and Hayman, have been developed as
international standard resorts at international standard prices.  A
number of other islands have "family style" resorts aimed at the
ordinary Australian.  Hamilton Island has an airport.  You can fly
directly to it and take a boat to the other islands.  All the other
islands have check in counters at the Hamilton Island airport.

South Molle was run by Ansett Airlines.  Their lease expires in June
'94 and they are not renewing it.  So far, I have not heard whether it
is closing down or someone else is taking over.  Radisson Long Island
Resort was targeted at the 18 - 35 age range.  It has just been
purchased by another company.  The new owners say it will cater to all
ages.  I don't know if they plan to redevelop or whatever [JO].

South Mille is remaining open - it is under new management. [JO]

The islands are inside the Great Barrier Reef.  All the resorts
provide high speed catamarran trips to the outer reef (about 2 hours
to get there).  There you can snorkle, take glass bottom boat trips or
take a ride in a "submarine".  These don't submerge.  You sit inside
the underwater hull and look out through big windows.  The Whitsunday
Island region is world famous for scuba diving and sailing.  There are
dive boat operators for qualified scuba divers.  The island resorts
also have dive courses. Yachts can be rented for bareboat cruising and
there are tour operators who take people on 5 to 7 day cruises of the
islands using 45 to 55 foot yachts . You sail in the daytime and camp
on the beaches with tents, sleeping bags and air mattresses at night.
The operator provides the camping gear, crew and cook.  This is a bit
of "pot luck" since you will be with strangers and the boat might have
6 passengers or 18.  The cooking is also "pot luck" because the cook
will probably be a young woman who is touring Australia and has signed
on for only one trip.  With luck, she may know how to cook!  I did
this once and liked it.  For details, ask your travel agent for
brochures on the Queensland Islands, Whitsunday Islands or Northern
Queensland.

Cairns and Cape York: Now jump another 1000 km north.  Cairns is in
the tropics at about 9S latitude and is also inside the Great Barrier
Reef.  It has access to the reef and the rainforest of Cape York.
When I went there it was small and very lovely.  There are no beaches
in Cairns but some beautiful tropical beaches to the north of it and
around Port Douglas (an hour drive to the north).  Since I was there,
it has been developed as an international tourist resort (mostly for
Japanese).  I don't know what the town is like now but the reef and
rain forest are still there.  Cairns is an international airport with
flights to Japan, New Zealand and the US.  You could go skiing in NZ
in August and than fly to Cairns for swimming and sunning on the reef.
Warning: Don't go to Cairns or the Whitsunday Islands between December
and March. That's the cyclone (hurricane) season.

The Outback: I've never been there and have no interest in it.
However, if you want desert, kangaroos, or dingos than Alice Springs
and Uluru (Ayers Rock) are supposed to be very good.  There is also a
tropical park called Kakadu in the Darwin area.  Its reported to have
lots of crocodiles and birdlife and be very interesting if that's your
thing.  Watch the weather.  The rainy season is said to be awful -
roughly November to March.

11.4.2 A Trip description 

I returned from Oz about three four months ago.  I had an 11 month
stint down there.  I was working in Sydney and Brisbane.  I went on a
whirl wind tour of Australia which included.  Sydney -> Alice Springs
-> Darwin -> Cairns -> Sydney.  All this was done in 2 and 1/2 weeks.
I would not go into the outback or the rainforest, etc. without some
sort of guide but Australia is reasonably civilized.  Your main enemy
is not going to be people but the harsh environment.

I do not recommend that you try and see Australia in 2 and 1/2 weeks
like I did.  The reason that I did that is because I was trying to fit
it into my regular holidays.  What I did in that time was well filled
but it would nice to have the luxury of time to contemplate what you
want to do and where you want to go.  I was in Alice Springs for about
5 days and that was about 2 days too long.  It's the middle of the
desert and the key landmarks there are Ayer's Rock, the Olgas, and
King's Canyon.  I definitely recommend seeing Alice Springs.  The rock
is spectacular.  I went on an AAT Kings tour but if I was to do it
again, I would either go on a younger or more adventure based tour
(AAT Kings is for the blue rinse set :->).  Or else organise
transportation to the major places and just hike around (that would be
far cheaper than taking a tour and I don't think that you miss much by
skipping a tour.)  In the desert it is very important that you carry
lots of water.  It is very easy to get dehydrated.  Also, I would
recommend going to Alice in the Winter (which is the same time as
North American summer) if at all possible.

In Darwin, I went on a 5 day tour of Kakadu with an adventure
back-packing company called Backpacker's Australia (or something like
that.  There's another tour which is shorter but similar by Saratoga
Safaris (there is more of an emphasis on wildlife on this one.  It is
run by an ex-zoologist).  I organised my travel out of Darwin through
Top End Travel.  They are excellent!  I was in Darwin during the dry
season (which is the same as the North American summer)

Cairns, I found, to be very touristy.  There's a million things to do
but they all cost money.  Definitely get out on the reef.  There's
tons of cruises out to the reef to suit any type of lifestyle.  You
can snorkel or dive and there are tons of certification courses
available if you are interested in getting certified.  (I couldn't
because of my asthma)

11.4.3 Uluru (Ayers Rock)

*Accomodation at Uluru (Ayers Rock) [GR]

1) If you are a group 4/5/6 ++ people look at the possiblity of
renting a mobile home... It is stationary but cost about A$50/day.
2) Pioneer Outback Hotel (A$80/night bed/bath)..booked through AAT
Kings travel agency..very pleased
3) Kitchenettes... somewhere in the 60 to 100 dollar range... double
bed, a/c, share bathroom...best choice at price
4) Check with NT bureau

11.4.4 Places of interest in Tasmania

[JL] Things I would look at:

The Gorge in Launceston
Hellyer Gorge on the West Coast
Ocean Beach at Strahan
day walks at Lake St Clair (overnight if you're set up)
SW rainforest (might be difficult - check out adventure tours out of Hobart)
scuba diving at Bicheno
fishing on the East Coast

Tas Redline Coaches, who have some sort of Tassie Pass for out of
state travellers (008 006 006). However [MP] Just be careful to
investigate the Red Line Tassie Pass a little more carefully.  I spent
several weeks in Tassie and loved it with one exception: actually
getting around.  The Pass doesn't even go to certain parts of the
island and when it does it's usually once a day, every other day, and
things like that.  It's possible to rent a VW bug for A$25 per day or
something which really works well if there are two or three of you.
Four, five or six might be pushing it a little.  Simply drawing out
your itinerary beforehand and then pricing it on individual tickets
actually competes with the Pass within a few dollars believe it or
not!


[CP] 
Location
	Bicheno, Tasmania, Australia

Description
	Bicheno is a small fishing community located on the East Coast
	of Tasmania.  The dive shop and other locals are trying to
	get the bay declared an Under Water Park.  They ask that you
	please not take any shells or game.  You will appreciate why
	they want to keep it the way it is.  You can buy fish, crab,
	lobster, at the local fish market fresh from the fishing boats 
	at a more-than-reasonanble price.  A camp ground is located 
	close to the dive shop or you can stay at the dive shop itself, or
	you can stay at one of two hotels in town.

Service
	Bicheno Dive Centre
        4 Tasman Highway
        Bicheno, Tasmania 7215, Australia
	Phone: International+ (003) 75-1138

        Rental Equipment is in very good condition.

Charter Boats
	Bicheno Dive Centre

General Information
	Site Rating: 
		 Excellent, Very Unspoiled

	Best Time of Year to Dive:
		Best visability is in winter-spring (July-November).
		Summer is not really bad but you may get plankton bloom
		  and more people show up.

	Water Temperature:
		Average 50 F, Use 1/4 inch or 7mm wetsuits

	Types of Diving:
		Boat, Shore, Cave, Night, Deep and Shallow

Remarks 
	My wife and I really enjoyed Bicheno.  The dive centre is run by
	an Ex-Abalone diver who says he has dove every inch of Tassy.  
	You can really appreciate how professional and smooth the diving
	is set up, you really feel safe diving with them.  We stayed at
        the dive centre in our own private cabin.  We would leave our door
        step, suited up, get on the boat dive for 30-40 minutes and be back
        taking a warm shower in about an hour.  We would usually do about
        2-3 dives per day.  The night dives were really incredible,
        Sea Horses with 8-12 inch body length, Octopus.  

        For most of the 10 days we were the only people on the boat.
	We thought it was a lot like Monterey, CA use to be like (about
	150 years ago).

11.4.5 Accomodation tips to the low budget motorhome traveller (BB)

1. Obtain the Automobile club district maps for the area. They are the
best to navigate by showing all the sights to see and have "Rest
Areas" marked on them. Now some rest areas can be nothing more than a
rubbish bin on the side of the road but others, particularly in
Queensland can have toilets,fresh water and even showers. As a
traveller you can stay for up to two nights at a proper rest area. I
know of two places within 20mins of the Gold Coast for example.

2. Obtain information from National Parks, State Conservation Areas
and State Forests on camping areas. Most are free and those that you
have to pay at are generally worth it. I regularly stay the night in a
State Forest near the Sunshine Coast.

3. Many remote picnic areas, lookouts etc are also good for one night
even if the sign says "No Camping". Who's going to know if it's only
one night and you don't make it obvious? Up to 10pm you're only having
a BBQ before returning to the camp aren't you?  I'm not campin' I'm
goin' fishin'!. And of course you got up early to have breakfast in
the bush.

4. The first bit of bush you like. Often there are areas of unfenced
land on the side of the road. Just find a track and drive in (careful
if raining, don't get bogged). With all bush sites I prefer to be as
far away from the road as I can. First because it's quieter. Second -
if they can't see you they can't bother you, even if it's some kids
wanting to hoon around. I can remember one night at Mallacoota this
young couple drove right past us into the centre of the clearing (it
was dark). She got out and urinated on the ground in full view then
back into the car for some fun. Suddenly they realised that they were
not alone. Engine on, quick reverse out of their favourite parking
spot!

I have been touring this way for 24 years without any trouble but a
lot of adventure. Camping grounds are for when you desperately need a
shower or to wash the clothes. They invariably are built next to the
highway or railway, have noisy people who insist on partying all night
and wasting the daylight hours sleeping in, and aren't anything like
being in the bush at dusk or dawn when the native animals are active.

11.4.6 Adelaide and SA

In Adelaide itself, there's some very interesting architecture.  It's
one of only two designed cities I know of in Australia - the other
being Canberra, the federal capital.  It was designed by Colonel
William Light (I hope I remember correctly) in the early days of the
colony.

There are many lovely churches, and the parks are also nice.  The
stone architecture in the area is unique in Australia - wood was
scarce in SA, so stone was used.  Also, many of the early migrants
were from Germany and Europe, and preferred stone to wood.

The town of Hahndorf just outside the city has some wonderful german
influences, including the food!

Then there's the wineries: To the north is the Clare Valley, to the
south is McClaren Vale, to the north east is the Barossa Valley.  The
Barossa is the longest established, and my personal favourite, because
one of there specialties is german-style white wine.  McClaren Vale
has some interesting styles including the light italian table wines.
Down in the south-eastern corner of the state can be found other
wineries specialising in sparkling wines (including methode
champagnoise).  The areas around Mildura also have extensive grape
crops, but these are often for sultanas, or made into wines by the
southern wineries.

The citrus growing areas close to Mildura are great for fruit - the
town of Berri can be seen lending its name to products in the
supermarkets all over the country.

National parks and recreation areas: The Adelaide hills have a number
of small national parks and recreation areas including some
spectacular gorges and viewpoints.  There are other small parks to the
south on the Fleurieu Peninsula, including Hallet Cove.  Kangaroo
Island, off the tip of the peninsula is a popular weekend destination
and has a lot to offer - including the chance to see seal colonies.

Other places for weekend trips - or preferably longer - include the
Flinders ranges and the Gammon ranges, the Eyre peninsula and the
Grampians National Park in Victoria.  There are also extensive
wetlands near the mouth of the Murray River, and paddle-wheeler trips
on the Murray are popular.

The Flinders Ranges, especially the Gammon Ranges at the northern end,
are a good introduction to a visitor of what "the Outback" really
means.  There are comfortable motels to stay in, but the gorges and
valleys are well worth seeing.  I was lucky enough to see the Gammon
just after rain - the ephemeral flowers were amazing, and the red rock
reflecting in still pools of the gorges something that must be seen to
be believed.

[DS] Kangaroo Island, just a 30-minute light plane flight or a
somewhat longer ferry ride from Adelaide, is a must-see.  The tourist
office can organise extremely cheap long-weekend trips incl. car hire
(but watch out for the roads -- I had a tyre come off and didn't even
realise it, the roads are that corrugated!) and accomodation.  It's a
great place with excellent swimming and fishing and, of course, lots
of kangaroos.

[WS] For animal petting, Cleland Wildlife Reserve is the place to go.
You can walk among wallabys and Kangaroos and on occasion pet a koala.
If you like to hike, you could start at Waterfall Gully and hike there
through some beautiful woods, but check the distances and directions
first to make sure it fits your time and hiking constraints.

If you like to try good wine, McClaren Vale is south of Adelaide and
Borossa Valley is north.  They have some of the finest wines that are
not too outrageously priced, in the world.  A tour by a knowledgeable
native would be most helpful.  My wife, an Adelaide native, recommends
Handorf, a German town not too far, and the art gallery where you
might view Hans Heisen's art.  A popular place to shop is the Rundall
Mall in downtown Adelaide.  On the River Torrens is "Popeye" which
offers quiet trips on the river.  In that vicinity is the theatre
complex. The Adelaide Zoo and the parklands around the main city are
also pleasant endeavours.

[MW] BEACHES - don't let anyone tell you beaches are no fun in winter,
it just isn't true.  Personally, I think the southern beaches are the
best, that is the ones south of Adelaide, heading towards Cape
Jervois.  For a secluded beach, you can't go past Normanville.  If you
like body surfing, try Boomer beach near Goolwa.  Victor Harbour is
worth a day trip, and you can see fairy penguins under the rocks on
Granite Island.  I haven't been to Kangaroo Island for quite a while,
but people say it's still beautiful and relatively unspoilt.

HILLS - Adelaide's best kept secrets.  Besides Hahndorf, there are
many other (less touristy) towns, with local crafts, tea shops, lovely
old buildings, and great country bakeries.  There are also forests to
be wandered through (Kuitpo "Kai-po" and Second Valley are the
largest).  Further north, the wildlife park at Cudlee Creek (already
mentioned elsewhere in this newsgroup) is a must.  In the Barossa, try
to see the Whispering Wall.

HIKING and bushwalking - the Flinders Ranges are really spectacular.
The best time to go is August/September, when the wildflowers are out
and the weather is not too hot.

11.4.7 Touring Australia by Motorcycle [C]

Oz by bike is heaven. Try the Great Ocean Road south west of
Melbourne. Most of the country is pretty safe, and it's beautiful, and
has lots of lovely curvy country roads, and frequent bike rallies
(look at Two Wheels and Bike Australia magazines when you get here)
and there are campsites all over the place in National parks, state
forests etc etc. And plenty of "motorcycle enthusiasts" to help you
find your way around.  (There's a wry joke that once we were filthy
bikies, but when the Grand Prix brings money into the state, we become
"motorcycle enthusiasts".)

A few tips: don't ride at dusk in the country; that's when you find
lots of animals on the road. Don't travel alone on back country dirt
roads in the desert a long way from the nearest town, unless you are a
mechanical genius and can fix everything with a bit of string and
chewing gum. Take water if you do that. There are sealed roads all
round the country, but a lot of the minor roads in less populated
areas are dirt. Radar detectors are illegal, and Australian beer is
good but drink-driving is a very bad idea. Sun-screen is a good idea.
Spring and Autumn are good times to travel, because wearing full
leathers in summer sucks severely. If you're female, you need to be
able to cope with minor sexual harrassment, but generally there's a
sufficient bike cameraderie that it won't get dangerous. Just insult
them back. (And if you're gay or lesbian there's cool bike groups
around; "Dykes on Bikes" usually lead off the Mardi Gras parade.)

11.4.8 Cheap travel agent [RM]

Last month I questioned the net looking for consolidators to get a
cheap ticket to Australia. I found a good source and thought people
would be interested - indeed there have been a number of requests in
rec.travel.air lately.

Try AUSTRAVEL 1-800-633-3404
Their San Francisco office is 360 Post Street, Suite 606
Phone (415) 781-4329, Fax (415) 781-4358.
They also have offices in New York, Chicago, Houston, Sydney, and I
believe they started in the UK, so there may be offices there (hence
the unrestricted distribution of my article).

I don't know whether they are a "consolidator" as such, as I am not up
on the strict definition. They have block bookings with Qantas which
are definitely cheaper than I could get direct through Qantas or my
usually great travel agent (who is now going to use AUSTRAVEL for her
Aussie ticketing). You can still get FF miles with these tickets which
I understand is not generally the case with consolidators.  They also
got me cheaper domestic connecting flights in Australia and I believe
have package deals for tours and accomodation that I cannot comment
on, having not used them.  They gave me good fast service, fedexed my
tickets to me, are bonded with IATA.... in other words this is a
recommendation from a happy customer who had one good experience and
thought you'all ought to know.

11.4.9 Places of Interest in Melbourne

[CP]

Melbourne is one of the top restaurant cities in the world however it
doesn't seem to have adopted the North American fashion of brew pubs
and microbreweries. If you want to you can buy bottled beer at a
bottle shop and take it with you to a BYO (Bring Your Own, ie bring
your own liquor) restaurant. There are LOTS of these in Melbourne.
Many pubs serve inexpensive counter meals but usually have fairly
restricted dining hours (eg 12-2 and 6-8pm). If you really want to
explore Melbourne's dining scene pick up a copy of either "The Good
Food Guide" or it's spinoff "Cheap Eats in Melbourne" in one of the
bookstores downtown (there are several along Bourke St., Swanston St
and Elizabeth St.).

"Must see" sights? Melbourne has a lot of interesting things to see
but doesn't really have any truly compelling sights. The Victoria
Market (Elizabeth and Victoria streets) is a large farmers market that
may be of interest. It's open Tuesday and Thursday mornings, Fridays
till about 3:30, Saturday till 12 and Sunday till 5. There is no
produce sold on Sunday.

The Melbourne zoo is worth a visit (far more so than Taronga zoo in
Sydney!). The arboreal primate exhibits, small feline exhibits, great
flight aviary, butterfly house and platypusary are some of its best
features.

The Botanic Gardens are a very fine example of formal gardens and
contain numerous native plant species along with imports from the
Northern Hemisphere.

The Shrine of Remembrance, adjacent to the botanic gardens is a grand
memorial to those who have died in various wars. Some of the statues
around it are quite interesting. There is a really good view from the
parapet!

Outside Melbourne you could visit the Dandenong Ranges and see Fern
Tree Gully national park, the Ricketts Sanctuary and the state
Arboretum, a little further away is Healesville with it's native
animal zoo (the Healesville Sanctuary). A few miles north of
Healesville (up Myers Creek Road) Mt St Leonard offers a spectacular
view of the Yarra Valley. The walk to the top goes through some
magnificent forests. The Great Ocean Road to the south-west of
Melbourne is a wonderfully scenic weekend trip.

The two biggest tourist day trips from Melbourne are probably to
Ballarat and to Phillip Island. Ballarat has much to do with
Victoria's gold mining history. Its easy to spend a day at the
Sovereign Hill Historical park there. Phillip Island has the "penguin
parade" when fairy penguins come home to feed their chicks and
scramble up the beach oblivious to the crowds of tourists watching
them.

There are lots of National parks within 6 hours drive of Melbourne. If
you have no idea what to do or where to go visit the Victorian Tourist
Bureau in Collins St near Swanston St and they will give you LOTS of
ideas. Alternatively check with the RACV (Royal Automobile Club of
Victoria), they have reciprocal arrangements with many foreign
automobile associations (eg AAA in the US) and will provide maps and
information on production of your membership card.

11.5 Advice for Australians in ....

11.5.1 United Kingdom

Banks.

I tried the big five:  Natwest, Lloyds, Midland, Barclays, and Abbey 
National.  Lloyds weren't interested in opening an account for someone who was 
only in the UK for a short time (18 months!).  Abbey National and Barclays 
required the last six months' worth of bank statements from my Australian bank, 
proof of income, a residential address, etc.  Midland wanted proof of income, 
or proof of employment, and to see my passport.  NatWest just wanted to see my 
passport.

I now bank with NatWest.  When I opened my account I did not have a
residential address - this did not bother them, and they used my employment
address instead.  The passport is merely used as proof of identity.  Opening
an account took 10 minutes at the local branch.  Within two weeks I had a 
cheque book, paying-in book, and a "Switch" card. The latter is both an ATM and 
direct debit card which saves me from having to carry large amounts of cash.

Transferring money from Australia to the UK is relatively easy.  There is a 
flat fee of $20.00 (I bank with the Commonwealth), and NatWest charge UKP 6.00. 
per transfer.  Therefore, it's best to transfer large chunks of money (many 
$1000's) at a time. I've found that arranging the transfer by fax is easiest. 
The whole operation takes roughly five working days from faxing the two banks 
concerned to having the money in my UK account.

NatWest also offer a direct debit / standing order facility to pay regular 
bills, and also support Cirrus / Maestro and Access (Mastercard) services.  
This means that I can use my Com Bank cards (which were Cirrus / Maestro-
enabled prior to leaving Oz) in NatWest's ATM's.  However, I believe every 
Cirrus / Maestro ATM transaction of this nature carries a $4.00 flat fee.

General note: if you are an Australian taxpayer, and do not pay UK income tax, 
then fill out the appropriate form to inform the UK bank of this (ask the bank 
for it). That way, what little interest your money earns will not be taxed.


Calling Home.

I use Mercury Communications Ltd. to call home.  They promise a 10% reduction 
on standard BT rates for calls to Australia (and STD calls within the UK).  
This rises to 15% reduction for four nominated UK STD numbers and one 
international number through the "Your Call" scheme.  To use Mercury, one must 
subscribe to them (flat annual fee) - the numbers are in the phone directory.  
The access code and pin are stored in memory in a Mercury-compatible phone 
(available from many retailers starting at UKP 15.00 for ownership).  (I use 
my PC terminal software's phone number database and dial prefix function with
my modem, pick up the phone when the called number starts to ring, and then 
disable the modem!)

Use BT for local calls in the UK - even Mercury admit that it's cheaper.


Health.

Upon arrival, contact the Family Health Service.  Again, the numbers are in the 
telephone directory.  State your situation, and where you are residing, and 
they will give you the names / addresses / phone numbers of local GP's.  If 
you're still an Australian taxpayer, then you are covered under the NHS / 
Medicare reciprocal aggreement.  If any GP that you contact queries such 
an arrangement, have them contact the FHS office that you contacted.


Other Services.

Organisations such as electricity authorities, British Gas, water authorities, 
etc., may as for a deposit (e.g. UKP 100.00 from Northern Electric, UKP 90.00 
from BT) unless you have a credit record in the UK.  Many will waive this if 
you set up a direct debit transfer with your bank (BT didn't in my case!).


Value Added Tax (VAT) (like GST  :)  ).

It's currently 17.5% for most (all ?) items excepting some exempt categories.  
I believe that if one buys certain goods in the UK and plans to leave within 
three months then one can claim back the VAT upon departure. However, I've not 
tried it, and am not sure of what paper work is required apart from the VAT 
receipt.


Visiting "English Heritage" Properties.

Many buildings / structures of historical / cultural / tourist significance are 
operated by English Heritage.  They have a reciprocal agreement with the 
National Trust in Australia.  If you are a member, this can reduce the entry 
fees to many interesting sites.

12.LANGUAGE

12.1 Australian pronunciation

* Prounounciation of Aussie [WE]

Information concerning how/why Australians pronounce Aussie with an
/z/ and Americans pronounce it with a /s/.  A linguistic analysis (I'm
a linguist) suggests the following:

1.  The Australian pronunciation of Aussie (/z/) is a normal
phonological feature called "intervocalic voicing of consonants" where
English speakers make /s/ -> /z/, /k/ -> /g/, /t/ -> /d/ etc. when
they are between consonants.  Some Americans pronounce "significant"
as significant, water as wader and we all say "laser" with a /z/.

2.  The American pronunciation of Aussie (/s/) is an example of
spelling pronunciation -- which, once again is normal behaviour when
we don't know the pronunciation of a word.  We usually say it the way
it spells until we find out differently.

3.  So why do Americans insist on saying Aussie with an /s/ even when
we tell them Aussies say it with a /z/?  Once again, that's normal.
We all have great difficulty saying things in a way that goes against
the grain -- our grain. I've lived a long time in the U.S., but still
can't say NEW York with /nu/.  I have to say /niu/.  Most Americans
say greasy (/s/) or blouse (/s/) -- all with /s/'s.  I think it may go
against the grain for them to say Aussie with a /z/.

* To distinguish Australian accents from various British ones: [RC]

  Australian "day" sounds like "die";
  Australian "buy" sounds like "boy".

So that "daylight" ends up something like "die-loyt".  For more
details see Afferbeck Lauder's, "Let Stalk Strine".

Actually I've heard people distinguish three different Australian
accents: Cultivated, General and Broad.  In the "broad" variant the
vowel shifts are particularly obvious, but I speak "cultivated" and
have been mistaken for English by Englishmen several times.

[PW] Some pommy accents are quite similar to strine.  In particular,
some of the south-coast ports are quite similar - probably because of
historical reasons !  There seem to be fundimental differences between
the northern and southern english accents.  The australian accent
seems to have picked up a mixture of the pronunciations such that
people here sometimes think that I'm really posh because of the way I
pronounce some words.

The variation in ozzie accents seems to be more to do with the scale
of the changes in pronunciation rather that the actual changes.  For
example, country accents always seem "stronger" that city ones, but
seem to have the same way of pronouncing words.  This seems to hold
true for all but the most posh people, but they live in world of their
own anyway.

[TG]

There are many theories about the evolution of the Australian accent.
There would appear to be influences from cockney pronunciation, and
there are also vestiges of Irish influences as well (a lot of early
teachers were of Irish background, particularly in church run
schools.)  You will also find remnants of Irish, Scottish and Welsh
influences in the Australian pronunciation of some words.  Then, of
course, we had a large influx of German, Greek and Italian
immigration, which has probably also had an influence as well.  Of
later years, the language has been strongly influenced by TV media,
from, you guessed it, the USA.  To say that the convicts are the
predominating influence is probably false.  There were many more free
settlers than there ever were convicts.

One common comparison that is made is between the Received
Pronunciation (RP) (a la BBC English) and what is termed Cultivated
Australian (CA).  There is also a classification of Australian speech
called General Australian (GA).  GA differs from CA in that vowels
tend to become a little longer and some vowels are "diphthongized"
(hard to explain if you don't know phonetics -- maybe someone else
could have a bash at this one?)  CA is more likely to be found in
formal speech and GA in conversational.  There tends to be a slight
erm, what you might call a "class distinction" between the two,
although this is by no means a general thing. (Often politicians
cultivate a GA manner of speaking to be more appealing to the voting
population, as GA is more laid back, you might say.)  I might also
point out that the Australian accent was the but of much disdain for
some time earlier this century -- speech trainers would teach the
"proper speech" i.e. RP.

In general, CA speakers tend to form their vowels more forward in the
mouth than is the case for RP.  This is why RP pronunciation is often
associated with the phrase "plum in the mouth" because the vowels tend
to be formed further back in the mouth.  To an CA speaker, this is
probably the most noticable characteristic.  RP speakers also tend to
have a more rounded lip formation than CA speakers for the same
sounds.  (Now *that's* a big generalisation!)

Another difference is the way in which words and phrases are
pronounced in isolation and in connected speech.  CA speakers tend to
use what is called the neutral vowel more often than RP speakers do in
connected speech.  Also CA speakers tend to have a slightly smaller
intonation range than RP speakers.  This lead to several criticisms of
CA speech as "monotonous" by many speech trainers earlier this
century.  There are other traits of RP pronunciation that are not
present in CA, such as frequent use of a definate vowel in the final
position.  These differences wrt neutral vowel and intonation patterns
are also why many Australians label someone speaking with an RP accent
as excessively pedantic.

These are some of the characteristics compared to RP, now of course
there are many dialectic variations of English in Britian!  RP is just
used as a useful reference point.  Also, any given speaker is not
necessarily going to use a "pure" dialect either, you'll find CA
speakers using GA pronunciations and all sorts of variations in the
middle.

One book you might like to look at is Mitchell and Delbridge
"Phonetics of English in Australia".

12.2 Australian spelling

[Contribution needed. AN]

12.3 Australian slang, word origins

* What is the origin of the word "Pom" or "Pommy"? [BR]

 - from daniels@rand.org (Greg Daniels):
   shipping crates labeled "P.O.M.E."  (Property of Mother England)

 - for deverett@vms.macc.wisc.edu (David W. Everett):
   Prisoner of Mother England (POME)

 - from njc@robots.ox.ac.uk (Nick Cerneaz):
   Piss Off Mother England

 - from adally@afit.af.mil:
   convict clothing being labelled P O H M for Prisoner Of His Majesty

 - from ins559n@aurora.cc.monash.edu.au (Andrew Bulhak):
   Push Off Miserable Englishman

 - from ins559n@aurora.cc.monash.edu.au (Andrew Bulhak):
   short for pomegranate, referring to the complexion of recent arrivals
   who have not yet absorbed much of the Australian sun

 - from Jacco.Zwetsloot@f550.n635.z3.fidonet.org (Jacco Zwetsloot):

The general concensus (amongst academics at least) is that `pom' came
through this train of words and word association: immigrants came to
be called `jimmygrants' via some sort of rhyming slang.  `jimmygrants'
became `pomegranates' via another sort of rhyming slang.  This in turn
became shortened to `pommy' and `pom'.  While this may seem like an
incredible (in the literal meaning of the word) explanation for the
origin of `pom', it is verified in a number of books.  One being "The
Australian Language" published in 1945.

 - from bls@sector7g.Eng.Sun.COM (Brian Scearce):
   My _Dictionary of Historical Slang_ has this to say about it:

        pommy, Pommy. A newcomer from Britain, esp. from
        England: Australian: C.20.  The OED Sup. records it at
        1916, but it was current before the Great War.  Origin
        obscure; possibly a corruption of TOMMY imported by
        Australian soldiers returning from the Boer War
        (1899-1902).  Or perhaps ex. *Pomeranian*, a very
        "superior" sort of dog.  It may also have developed
        from JIMMY GRANT thus: Jimmy Grant > immy-granate >
        pomegranate > pommy.

   "Jimmy Grant" is, as a previous poster pointed out, rhyming slang for
   "immigrant" (or "emigrant").

* Sydney is spelt with a "y", not Sidney. It was named after
Baron Sydney of Chislehurst, the Home Secretary at the time when
the First Fleet arrived.  Actually, they named Sydney Cove and
the city was supposed to be called Albion, but it didn't come out
that way. [HG]

* State-based Nicknames

From:		Nickname:
NSW		Cockroaches,
                Ma-staters,
                Mexicans (by Queenslanders)
                Cornstalks
Vic		Mexicans
                Cabbage-patchers
SA		Crow Eaters
WA		Sand Gropers
Qld		Banana Benders
Tas		Apple Eaters
NT		Top-enders

* Origin of "Whinge"

[BD] The Macquarie dictionary says "Northern form of OE _hwinsian_ to
whine", and for whine "OE _hwinan_".

* Origin of "Dunny"

[LC] I was using the toilet the other day and noticed that the
brandname stamped on the porcelain was "Dunedin". Could this be the
origin from which the endearing term "dunny" is derived ??

[IR] Unfortunately no.  The Macquarie gives: "short for Brit. d.
dunnakin, dunnaken, from dannaken, from danna (dung) + ken (place)"

* "Show us your map of tazzy"

[PG] Well, being the literary expert that I am . . . 8-) I'll have a
crack at it.  Reference page 182 "A Nice Night's Entertainment" Barry
Humphries published 1981 by Granada:

"Anyway, there she was starkers! I didn't know where to look.  The
driver seen her norks in the rear-vision mirror and nearly come off
his dual carriageway.  He said, 'Ay, miss, 'ow are you goin' to pay
me?", at which she *pointed* ... Now, there's a nice crowd in here
tonight so I'm not going to tell you where she pointed; suffice it to
say she pointed at the map of Tasmania.  Those of you with a
rudimentary grasp of geography will have a rough idea of what I nearly
had a rudimentary grasp of - a large triangular land mass deep in the
southern hemisphere."  Quiz question: which BH character said this?
8-)

[JMack] I first heard the expression in conjunction with the arrival
of the show "Hair" in Sydney (this was about 1970). I don't remember
whether it was a friend, or a review in the paper or a quote from
Robert Helpman, but the person referring to the costumes on the stage,
mentioned the maps of tasmania.  It's not quite as graphic as Barry
Humphries use above, but it predates it.

* "Claytons'"

Originally the brand name of a non-alcoholic beverage that looks like
neat Scotch whiskey, the television commercial featured Australian
actor Jack Thompson(sp?) sitting at a pub bar and ordering "I'll have
a Claytons' - (to camera) the drink I'm having when I'm not having a
drink" Almost immediately the press media used "Clayton's
Promise(chk?)" to headline a politician "making a promise when you're
not making a promise".  It now has accepted usage as a derogatory
adjective of anything that has questionable authenticity.  (Victorian
usage anyway) [RK]

* "Nugget"

This is a brand-name of a New Zealand shoe polish made of paraffin and
?carbon. To "nugget" your shoes is to apply any shoe polish and buff
the footware to shiny clean. Many Australians incorrectly think Nugget
brand shoe polish as a local Australian invention, it is just marketed
very well. [RK]

* "West Island".

New Zealand is another country, not a state of Australia. (Sometimes
people in NZ refer to Australia as the "West Island" as NZ has two
main land masses, North and South Islands) [RK]

* Origin of Taswegian [ZS]

Tasway n, {Colloq.}  Tasmania  [backformation from TASWEGIAN by analogy
     with {Norwegian} adj, from {Norway}
Taswegian n -> Tasmanian [TAS(MANIAN) + {-wegian} (by analogy with
     {Norwegian, Glaswegian,} etc.)]

* What is a bunyip? [BT]

Originally an Aboriginal legend.  A bunyip is a creature which lives
in fresh or brackish waterways (rivers, billabongs, swamps, but not
the ocean).  I believe that like most legendary creatures, it eats
humans.

More recently, "Bazza the Bunyip" has been appearing on Australian TV
sets, begging us all to "not muck up the Murray [River]", but I don't
think that's what the question meant.

Also, there is a mechanical bunyip in the Murray Bridge caravan park.
If you insert 20 cents, (s)he will rise from the depths of his/her
caged pond, let rip with some terrifying roars, and subside.  The
whole performance takes about a minute, and used to be a lot more
frightening when I was very young...


* What is the aboriginal name for koals?

"Koala" is a bastardisation of a word from an Australian language.  As
stated, the question doesn't really have an answer, as there were
around 200 Australian languages at the time of European contact, and
while many if not all of these are fairly closely related, there are
many different words for koala.  "Koala" appears to be a misreading of
"kuu(l)la", the word for Koala in certain languages of the Sydney
region. [CM]

* What does QANTAS stand for?

 "Qantas, n. The Australian international airline, founded in 
  1920 as the Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services 
  Ltd, with Sir Fergus McMaster as provisional chairman, P.J. 
  McGuinness and W. Hudson Fysh as the pilots and W.H. Baird as 
  the mechanic."

* And further in the line of QANTAS trivia, why is the name or word
(clue) Longreach, painted on the fuselages of the 747-400's?

Didn't QANTAS have it's origins at Longreach in QLD (where the
Stockman's Hall of Fame now is) ?  Also, when they bought the first
new 747-400, they flew it non-stop from London to Oz. [RB]

* Does water go down drains in the opposite way?

If you know anything about fluid dynamics than the fact that the
Rossby number for such a tiny vortex is very large, should give you
the answer.  In simple terms: a bath-tub vortex is much too small and
too fast for the Earth's rotation too have any effect on it. Planetary
scale mid-latitude lows and tropical cyclones however do spin in
opposite directions as a result of the rotation of the Earth, but
smaller scale vortices like tornadoes and dust devils do not. [SD]

[MJ] Technically, this is in some sense the case. The Coriolis force
due to the earth's rotation will in the absence of all other effects
cause the whirlpool in a bathtub to rotate in the opposite direction
in different hemispheres. In practice, however, the forces involved
are so small that other effects are more important ie you can make the
whirlpool go in either direction if you give it a nudge. As for using
this effect to determine whether a ship is north or south of the
equator, I don't believe a word of it. The effect increases as you go
away from the equator. It is largest at the poles. It is _zero_ on the
equator.  Anywhere even remotely near the equator, it is much smaller
than in somewhere like Australia. Combined with the fact that a ship
is likely to get buffeted around by the ocean a little, a much larger
effect, the whole idea is ridiculous.

* Australian Tea Tree Oil Malaleuca Alte [BS]

Tea tree oil-based antiseptic cream is the most fantastic skin cream
you can imagine.  It's great for open cuts/wounds, or acne, so far as
I have tried.  With acne, rub it in 3 times per day for very quick and
effective results.  Also I had a shampoo based on it - was good for
dandruff!  It was used in WWI in the trenches as an antiseptic cream
for open wounds.  Two companies that I know in Australia include
Melacare (based in Grafton) and Thursday (Island?) Plantation, not
sure where they are based but their products grace many a chemist's
shelves.  Also in London you can buy tea tree oil based products from
House of Mistry, Hampstead.

[KX] But it hurts (and stinks) like hell. I had a some pretty bad
scratches on my back that my cat inflicted and there is NO way that
I'd have had the courage to apply this stuff to "new wounds".
Although, I must admit, when I have actually used it (rare occasions,
I must add) it does actually seem to work.  BTW - if you're a horse
owner, Tea Tree Oil works well on minor cuts from fences etc., , bite
marks and similar injuries.

[AW] There is a pretty informative and interesting article on the tea
tree and its products in the February/March issue of _The Herb
Companion_, and probably lots of other information available from
herbal supply sources.  Seems to be a real wonder!

* What's the name of the swagman in Waltzing Matilda?

[RG] Andy.

"Andy sat
 Andy watched
 Andy waited till his billy boiled..." ;-)

* What does "BYO" mean in restaurants?

"Bring Your Own". Means alcohol.

* What is the "Didgeridoo"?

Traditional instrument of Australian Aborigines. A very long (> 6ft)
pipe.  You have to maintain a continuous stream of air through it,
which means you have to be able to store air in your cheeks to blow
out, and breathe in through your nose. See also section on music in
14.5.4.

* What is a wanker?

Macquarie:

1. _wank_ v.i. colloq. to Masturbate.

2. _wank oneself_, to maintain an illusion; deceive oneself. 3. an act
or instance of masturbation 4. a hobby: /flying is his wank/ 5.
behaviour which is self-indulgent or egotistical. 6. _wank wank_,
/Colloq./ (an exclamation indicating an ironic dismissal
   of some previous statement).

[orig. uncert.] -wanker, /n./

* Why do the stars on the Australian flag have 7 points?

(See 9.6.1 The Flag)

* WHY IS AUSTRALIA CALLED AUSTRALIA?

"Terra Australis" was the land of the south.  The portuguese
Fernandez de Quiros, in the serive of Philip III of Spain, named
it Australia del Espiritu Santo (Southern Land of the Holy Ghost)
"Australia" was used to flatter the King who was a Prince of the
Austria Ruling house. [VS]

* What is the source of ".oz" as an internet address representing
Australia?  (is it any different from ".au"; and why do some addresses
have ".oz.au" both, or is that just harmless redundancy?)

[What follows is the combinations of comments from Robert Elz (KRE), Chris
Maltby (CM) and Piers Lauder (PL) which I hope I've integrated completely.
Any of you three gents may feel free to correct me if I've mucked it up -SW]


[KRE] No, its certainly not the same as AU, nor is it redundant
in addresses where it appears, its required, and can't be used in
others.

Long ago when we were first setting up addressing for Aust we
were always going to use domain addressing - this is way back
when xxx.arpa was the standard name for US hosts on the arpanet
(& milnet).  That is, the use of domain names wasn't new, but
there was not yet any organised structure for domain naming (ie:
the edu, gov, ... and the two letter country names didn't yet
exist).

We knew we wanted a domain name that represented Australia in
some way, and things like AU and AUS were suggested, but we also
knew that our (then) small group fo sites couldn't really ever
claim to represent all of Australia, and do anything that would
effectively take over the entire Australian namespace leaving
nothing for anyone else unless they could fit themselves into our
naming scheme.

I should also mention that at this time we were already using
domain names, the domain we used was "SUN" which meant "Sydney
Unix Network" (and sometimes "Sydney University Network") - the
Australian net was an outgrowth of a network that started in
Sydney at Sydney University, and linked UNIX systems.  The
network started before Sun Microsystems was created - still they
asked us if we could use something other than "SUN" as our name -
and since our net was no longer just in Sydney, that seemed
reasonable (though the software used remained called "SUN" then
SunII and SunIII, until comparatively recently when SunIV was
renamed MHSnet).

[CM] The Australian use of domain tokens (they were more a hostname
adjective in the first implementation) was ahead even of the .arpa
stuff kre mentions above. I don't remember a "sun" domain, but there
were both hierarchical "domains" and non-hierarchical adjectives
which were intended to implement multicast delivery. I remember plans
to start a "news" adjective and to disseminate netnews to *.news, which
the SUN software would do efficiently. The "oz" domain also had the
meaning of "sites with an interest in global level routing" - if you
were the gateway to your site you had to belong to "oz". When kre
tried to connect Thailand he had many problems because the software
at that time made assumptions about ".oz" being somehow global.

[KRE - in response to "I don't remember a "sun" domain"]

It existed, but I'm not sure how visible it ever was inside Aust.
This may have only ever been added here on messages exported to
the world - I think it dates from about SUN II days, when domains
didn't exist at all on ACSnet.   If I hunted really hard I could
probably still find the message from Bill Shannon asking us to
stop using that name...

[PL] The SUN (II/III) software allowed a node to have as many domains as 
it liked, but one of them had to be nominated as the "primary" for the purpose
of making routing calculations more efficient - if the domain was "su"
for instance, the routing tables only needed to know about other nodes
in "su". The Thailand problem was due to a bug in SUNIII, rather than any
built-in knowledge about "oz" being special.

As an aside, it's worth noting that the SUN in Sun Microsystems stands
for "Stanford University Network".

[KRE] In any case, needing a name, something Australian, but not to
pretend to represent the whole of Australia, someone (it
certainly wasn't me, but I don't recall who) suggested "oz".
That sounds like the "Aus" part of "Australia" or "Aussie" when
spoken by an Australian (rather than an American, who pronounce
the thing in some totally wild way), and is fairly commonly used
by various people to represent things Australian (and has no
relationship I know of with the wizard), and was adopted.

[CM] In the great tradition of Unix, we selected "oz" because it was in
common usage in Australia and was shorter to type than any alternative.

[KRE] Eventually, the two letter country naming stuff was invented, and
AU of course became Australia - the "oz" part, which was always
just a subset of Australia fitted very neatly as a sub-domain of
AU, and so that's what was done with it.  In time, other
sub-domains of AU were created, including the edu.au com.au etc
domains, that serve basically the same community as oz.au does,
but also telememo.au and otc.au (which match the X.400 naming
"ADMD=telememo; C=au") that are used by commercial e-mail systems
in Australia, which has retrospectively justified the decision to
confine our naming within a subset of the Australian namespace,
and not even pretend to take over the whole thing.

There's another version of the "creation of oz" story, which
relates to the very first international e-mail connection that
the academic community had here, which ran between the University
of Sydney (home of the Sydney University/Unix Network) and Bell
Labs.  It was implemented using a maildrop on an IBM mainframe at
the University of Waterloo in Canada, Bell labs would dial there,
and leave mail for Australia in a file, then the University of
Sydney would call, using X.25, and pick up the mail in the file,
and leave another for Bell Labs the next time they called.  This
was set up by Ian Johnstone, initially from UNSW, but then at
Bell Labs - the theory is that "oz" was the name of the account
at Waterloo, or one of the file names, or something like that.
This may indeed be what sparked the suggestion to use "oz" as the
domain name, I don't know, I certainly don't recall that name
being in any visible use in that e-mail system though, whatever
use it had, if there was one, must have been internal I think.

[CM] In support of this story, it's important to note that ianj is close
to being the worst typist I have ever seen. "oz" is close to the
limit for him! Also, Bell Labs were using UUCP to deliver their end
to the gateway, and "oz!address" worked well at their end. At our end
we had only one site to mail to, so "user@usa" was sufficient.

Finally, "oz" still has a special meaning - although some of the .oz
sites are fully connected to the Internet. There is an assumption that
if you are called something.oz.au that you will maintain some sort of
ACSnet connectivity (even via an SMTP gateway), so that sites which
have only MHSnet software can work out from the address whether to
attempt internal delivery. Until AARNet began charging for MX address
registrations, kre had a rule for *.oz.au which merely inserted the
incoming message into ACSnet for delivery.

[PL] No, this isn't true anymore, there are now many sites running SUN IV 
that aren't in "oz.au" -- more likely "com.au" these days. Deciding
whether a site needs message delivery via SMTP or something else is
now done based on address tables specifying the delivery method.

[KRE] It is so true...

Though its not clear which part of Chris' paragraph you're
rejecting, you're right that's there's no longer any generic
*.oz.au -> ACSnet rule (but Chris did say "had") - but it is true
that xxx.oz.au -> ACSnet.   The reason for that has nothing
to do with the Internet, but with ACSnet - there are still lots
of sites (on ACSnet) that simply dump *.oz.au messages (as *.oz)
into ACSnet and assume they will be delivered.   Whenever a site
with an oz.au name leaves ACSnet and relies on MX stuff for mail
to be delivered (which works fine on the Internet) I get mail
from ACSnet sites asking what happened to them...

Note this doesn't imply (and hasn't since MHSnet) that sites
on ACSnet have to have oz.au names, anything legal that works
is OK - just that oz.au sites have to be on ACSnet.

* What is the village in northern France where the Australian presence
in WW1 is still celebrated?

In a little town called Viller-Bretonneuve, just outside Amiens,
there's a memorial to Australian soldiers a couple of kilometres
outside town, signposted from the main road. There's also a cafe on
the main road called the Boomerang Cafe, which makes me feel it's the
right area. :-) [HJ]

I can confirm that Villers-Bretonneux appears to be the town that you
have in mind. A large Australian contingent was situated in or near
the town during WW1. There remains a number of overt signs of this
presence [MS]:
- some of the streets and shops bear Australian names
  (e.g., Melbourne Street)
- there is a large Australian War Memorial just outside the town on a
rise. It contains a lookout and wall with the names of the Australian
soldiers lost (and, for the most part, never found) in the battles of
northern France and Flanders. On the wall, it is noted that 11,000
Australian soldiers died between 1916-1918, so this gives you an
indication of the size of the wall!
- At the entrance to Villers-Bretonneux, is situated Adelaide Cemetery
containing the graves of some of the Australian soldiers.
- In fact, the region contains a number of Australian and British
Commonwealth war cemeteries, all of them immaculately kept with cut
lawns and red roses!
- Villers-Bretonneux has an Australian "twin town" (Robinvale, Vic.
if I remember correctly).
- I spoke with the mayor, who showed me around the local school, which
was apparently built after WW1 with donations from Australia. The main
hall is panelled in Australian wood, and has a number of large wood
carvings of Australian animals.  The mayor said he visits Australia
every year, to maintain the contact between the Villers-Bretonneux and
Australia.

In the cathedral of nearby Amiens, there is a commemorative plaque
that states: "...to the memory of The Australian Imperial Force who
valiantly participated in the victorious defense of Amiens from March
to August 1918 and gave their lives for the cause of justice, liberty
and humanity..."

* Why is November 11th remembered (PB)

First and foremost, it is the anniversary of Armistice Day, the
end of the War to end all Wars (well,almost). It has also been
chosen as the date for the formal laying to rest in the
Australian War Museum in Canberra of the Australian Unknown
Soldier, an Australian soldier recovered from a graveyard in
France as a symbol for all Australians of the sacrifice the
Australian troops made during WW1.

It is also the anniversary of the sacking of the Whitlam
Government by the G-G, Sir John Kerr in 1975.

And finally, it is the 113th anniversary of the hanging of Edward
"Ned" Kelly in Melbourne Gaol in 1880.

12.4 Australian word usage (misc) 

* Units of measure

"kilo" - always refers to a weight (ie kilograms)
eg. "I've put on half a kilo", "one kilo of chicken breasts please"

"k" - always refers to distance or speed (ie kilometres or km/hour)
eg. "It's 250 k's to Lithgow from here", "I got busted doing 140 k's
on the freeway"

"mil"  - refers to liquid volume (ie millilitres)
eg. "I'll have the 500 mil bottle please"

The terms grams, metres, litres and degrees are used as is.  As yet
there is no conversational abbreviation for centimetres, which may
explain why description of people's heights in feet and inches still
persists somewhat in the street, although not in newspapers or on TV,
where the full word is used.

Oceania=Oz+NZ+Fiji+all those South Pacific Islands...

13.1 Recipes and food

13.1.1 Vegemite

Vegemite is a spread, made from a yeast extract. Kraft make it in
Australia.  It looks kinda like black smooth peanut butter, and tastes
VERY salty.[Glenn]

When I returned to Australia for a visit in 1985 I telephoned the
folks at Kraft in Pt. Melbourne. Here is the basis of what the man
told me regarding its manufacture:

First the yeast cells are taken from the breweries. For those of you
into making home made beer yor know what I mean. For the others, this
is a very thick tan colored "liquid" smelling like beer but loaded
with spent and still alive yeast cells. This "liquid" it then treated
so the yeast cells undergo "cell lysis" which means the cells burst
open.  The liquid is then "washed" (his term) to remove the cell
walls. The internal contents of the cell are then mixed with salt,
dried parsley and spices etc.(whatever that is -- I have not been able
to find etc. in Australia nor NorthAmerica) I guess it is the etc that
gives Vegemite its characteristic flavour!

Anyways in closing, the man said that it was packaged is small tins (I
have seen 1 oz. cans of it in Australian Army ration packs) and in
various containers up to barrel (45 gal?) size.

[DT] Vegemite and Marmite are not the same thing they were different
product brands. Marmite was actually in production and on the shelves
well and truly before vegemite ever existed.  When Vegemite was first
released it had a very difficult time - very few people bought it. It
was apparently taken off the market for a short time and given a new
(temporary) name after a competition was held. The winner came up with
the name Parwill. Followed with the slogan "If marmite then parwill".
Fortunately this also had marketing problems. It wasn't really until
the "war to end all wars" that the renamed vegemite started to sell.
It was all the shortages of food stuffs and the "scientific" sell
using the vitamin B argument.

If you really want a good amount of information I suggest that you
write to:

(See section 6.3 on Australiana in the U.S. for where to get vegemite)

* Pavlova

4 egg whites                    1 tablespoon corn starch
1 cup superfine sugar           half pint whipped cream
2 teaspoons vinegar             kiwi fruit or strawberries or passionfruit.

Place egg whites in a clean glass bowl. Beat slowly until frothy, then
increase the speed and beat until stiff. GRADUALLY add the sugar,
beating well after each addition. (When all the sugar has been added,
the mixture should be shiny, very stiff, and should stand in peaks.)
Gently fold in the vinegar and corn starch with a metal spoon.

Line a cookie sheet with brown paper (from a bag) and grease it
lightly. Pile the meringue mixture on it; it should form a cylinder
about 8 inches in diameter and 2 inches high.  Preheat the oven to
just under 300 degrees. Bake the pav for between 90 and 105 minutes.
When cooked, leave the oven door ajar and allow the pav to cool
inside. When cold, peel off the paper and transfer to a serving
platter. Just before serving, top with the whipped cream and fruit.
About 8 smallish servings.  [Steve Wright wright@mcs.anl.gov]

* Chocolate Crackles

Here is the recipe as read from the Rice Bubbles packet (Apparently it
is also on the Copha wrapper):
     
4 cups Rice Bubbles (= Rice Crispies)           250 gram copha (8 oz)
1.5 cups sifted icing sugar                     1 cup desiccated coconut 
3 Tbs cocoa (60 ml not 45ml, ie 4 American Tbs) 24 patty pans
     
Mix the first 4 ingredients together. Pour in melted Copha and mix.
Put into patty pans and chill.  Makes 24.

13.1.3 Meat Pies, Damper, Galah, pumpkin soup

* Damper

The basic recipe for damper is just self rising flour (4 C) and milk
(2 1/2 C) or water, mixed to a very stiff dough and then baked in one
of several ways: in a cast iron "dutch oven" buried in the ashes of a
fire, wrapped around the end of a stick (only a small handful or so)
and toasted over the fire, or formed into a round loaf and baked in a
conventional oven. You can spice it up by adding a handful of dried
fruits, by topping it with some mustard and grated cheese or, if
you've been bold enough to do it on a stick, by filling the hole where
the stick was with jam.  [CP]

* Australian Meat Pie [JN]:  

Reference: Australian Women's Weekly Home Library: Cooking Class
Cookbook, p70. (reproduced without permission).

Filling:
750 g (1.5 lb) minced steak             1 teaspoon soy sauce

2 beef stock cubes                      salt, pepper
1.5 cups water                          pinch nutmeg (generous -JN)
2 tablespoons plain flour               1/4 cup water, extra

Pie Base:
2 cups plain flour                      2/3 cup water
1/2 teaspoon salt                       60 g (2 oz) beef dripping

Pie Top:
375 g (12 oz) packaged puff pastry      1 egg yolk
1 teaspoon water

Making the filling: Place meat into the pan, stir over low heat until
meat is well browned.  Drain off any surplus fat.  Add crumbled stock
cubes, water, salt, pepper and nutmeg, stir until boiling, reduce
heat, cover, simmer gently for 20 min, remove from heat.  Combine
extra water and flour, stir until flour mixture is smooth.  Add flour
mixture to meat, stir until combined.  Return to heat, stir until meat
boils and thickens.  Add soy sauce (to give brown colour), stir until
combined.  Simmer, uncovered, 5 to 10 min; remove from heat allow to
become cold.

Making the pie base: Sift flour and salt into basin.  Place water and
dripping into saucepan, stir until dripping melts; remove from heat.
Make a well in centre of dry ingredients, add liquid, stir until
combined.  (2a. If you're in a hurry, just use premade (bought)
pastry.  It works ok, too. -JN)

Turn out onto lightly floured surface, knead lightly.  Roll out pastry
to line eight greased pie tins.  [We use "real" aluminium 6 or 8 in
pie casings - JN] Cut excess pastry around sides of pie plates using a
sharp knife.  Fill centres with cold meat filing.

Pie crust: Roll out puff pastry on lightly floured surface, cut out
rounds for top of pies, use a saucer as a guide.  Wet edges of base
pastry, and gently press tops into place, trim around edges with a
sharp knife.  Brush tops with combined egg-yolk and water.

Cooking: Bake in hot oven 5 minutes or until golden brown, reduce heat
to moderate, cook further 10 min.

Galah [PB]

Having plucked and cleaned galahs, place in a large saucepan of water
over an open fire.  Add two or three large rocks from a creek nearby.
Boil for two to three days, adding water as required.  By this time
the rocks should have softened, throw away the galahs and eat the
rocks.

Galah variations [KP]

Variation 1 (from my landlady the late Mrs. Rose Roots of Punch
Street, Gundagai, N.S.W., 2722) After the rocks are done, reduce heat
but continue simmering over low heat for another week. Make sure the
water level is kept up.

Variation 2 (from my team mates at the Junee RSL Shooting Club, Junee,
N.S.W.)  After the rocks are done, remove and maintain a slow boil of
the Galahs while a side dish of lava is obtained.  Serve both
immediately, preferably with the lava on top of the meat.

Pumpkin Soup [JL]

In a large pot I put cut up pumpkin, 2 chopped up onions, 3 chopped
slices of celery and enough water to cover.  Then I simmer it until
the pumpkin is soft and then I mash it all or blend it.  You then need
to add some curry powder which gives it a wonderful flavour.  The
biggest problem in the US is that most of the pumpkins are much more
watery than the Queensland blue pumpkins in Australia so the soup is
not the same.  However, this year I grew some JackbeLittle pumpkins
and they were just fine for soup.

[MM] I have found that "Butternut Squash" == "Butternut Pumpkin", make
a pretty good soup.  However they are definitely not the same as a
Queensland Blue.

Steak, Mushroom and Onion Pie [PL]

Ingredients:

1 lb round steak
1 onion
1 lb mushrooms

flour
pastry
Worcestershire Sauce
Steak Sauce
Beef Gravy powder
beer
butter or margarine
water

Cut meat into small pieces, toss in flour
and brown in margarine or butter in saucepan.

Add 2 cups of water to saucepan.
Chop onion, add to mixture.

Add Worcestershire Sauce, Steak Sauce, gravy mix
and beer to mixture. (Go easy on these to start with.
You can always add more of these after the meat is
cooked, and then you can taste it.)

Simmer covered for 30 minutes. While simmering, dice the
mushrooms and prepare the pie shells. I usually just
buy ready made pie pastry sheets for the pie shells
and ready made puff pastry sheets for the lids. 

Add the mushrooms and more seasonings if desired.
Simmer uncovered for 5-10 more minutes. This should
make enough for 2 shallow 9-inch pies. If the mixture
is too runny, add more gravy powder, or mix some flour
with a little water into a paste, and add that.

Ladle mixture into pie shell. Put puff pastry lid on top,
and press the lid and shell together. Poke a few small
holes in the lid and bake at 425 F for 20-25 minutes.

Serve with mashed potatoes and peas.

13.2 Songs 

13.2.1 "Waltzing Matilda",  by Banjo Paterson (3 versions :-)

* Waltzing Matilda - the song we had to have.  Copyright A.B.
"Banjo" Paterson (reproduced here w/o permission).  (thanks to
Ross Paterson for correcting the "tt" mispelling :-)
 
    Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong,
    Under the shade of a coolibah tree,
    And he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled,
    "You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me."

    Chorus:
      "Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda,
      You'll come a-waltzing Matilda  with me;
      And he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled,
      You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me."

      (Substitute third line of verse in each chorus.)

    Down came a jumbuck to drink at that billabong,
    Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee;
    And he sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tuckerbag,
    "You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me."

    Up rode the squatter, mounted on his thoroughbred,
    Down came the troopers -- one, two, three;
    "Whose that jolly jumbuck you've got in your tuckerbag?"
    You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me.

    Up jumped the swagman and sprang into the billabong,
    "You'll never catch me alive", said he;
    And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong,
    You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me.

There is also a "Queensland version" of the song, generally
believed to be the Patterson original (or pre-original).  It has
very similar words but has a different metre and is set to a
waltz tune. The "standard" version of the song was subsequently
rewritten to fit a march time tune pinched from some other
source.  In a wonderful essay published at the time of the
referendum which chose AAF as the anthem, some (forgotten by me)
author made the point that Waltzing Matilda was much more
appropriate. It tells the story of the swagman, unemployed and
desperate, driven to petty theft by society's oppression. The
squatter symbolises the priveliged property owners (probably
multi-national) with the sinister intrusion of the Police to
support privilege. Finally, the hero dies in an heroic gesture,
which unfortunately leads only to the pollution of an inland
waterway. [CM]

------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is what appears to be the original "Waltzing Matilda", from
"The Collected verse of A. B. Patterson", first published in
1921.  It seems to have been published in "Saltbush Bill, J.P."
(1917), although I have a feeling it may have been presented in
the Bulletin somewhat earlier.  Punctuation as printed in the
1982 edition -- don't blame me for the unmatched quotation mark
in the second verse :-). [IR]

                        WALTZING MATILDA
                       (Carrying a Swag.)

Oh! there once was a swagman camped in a Billabong,
   Under the shade of a Coolabah tree;
And he sang as he looked at his old billy boiling,
   "Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?"

      Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda, my darling,
         Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?
      Waltzing Matilda and leading a water-bag--
         Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?

Down came a jumbuck to drink at the water-hole,
   Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him in glee;
And he sang as he stowed him away in his tucker-bag,
   You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me."

Down came the Squatter a-riding his thoroughbred;
   Down came Policemen -- one, two and three.
      "Whose is the jumbuck you've got in the tucker-bag?
   You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me."

But the swagman, he up and he jumped in the water-hole,
   Drowning himself by the Coolabah tree;
And his ghost may be heard as it sings in the Billabong
   "Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?"

SWAGMAN: An itinerant labourer, a hobo, a bum.  So called because
his most important possession is his bedroll ("swag"), worn
behind his head as he walks along.[TM]

An excellent book, probably no longer in print, is "Diary of a
Welsh swagman" published in Australia some years ago. It is based
on the journeyings of a Welsh immigrant who was walzing Matilda
in the late 19th century [AC]
(Jenkins, Joseph, 1818-1898. Diary of a Welsh swagman, 1869-1894
/ abridged and annotated by William Evans. -- South Melbourne,
Vic. : Macmillan, 1975.)

WALTZING MATILDA "Waltzing Matilda", "humping a bluey, "carrying
a swag" are all terms for the same thing, namely tramping about
looking (or not looking) for itinerant work like shearing. The
"Matilda" was the swag. [PA]

Matilda=swag=bluey = (american) bedroll (blankets, etc.)

The reason I know of is that one name for a swag was "Matilda" -
a feminine name for the swagman's sole companion. Walking from
place to place was called "Taking Matilda for a waltz". [jds]

BILLABONG: A billabong is what the geographers call a "truncated
meander", i.e. a lake formed by a loop in a river course being
cut off by the river subsequently cutting a new and shorter path.
In the US they are called "ox-bow lakes".[JB]

COOLIBAH: Type of eucalypt (gum) tree with hard strong wood, very
hardy, found in central Australia near inland water courses and
billabongs.

BILLY: A small tin, generally used to boil water for tea.  The
third- most important possession of a swagman.

JUMBUCK:  A (male?) sheep.

TUCKERBAG: A bag for carrying tucker (food).  The second-most
important possession of a swagman.

SQUATTER: Someone  who just  grabbed land  early on,  often later
given title to the  land by  the government.Basically the  landed
gentry.

TROOPER:  A soldier or policeman. 

* Short Version

The "verse" below is from a competition to shrink works of OZ
literature conducted by the Australian (?) newspaper some time
ago. I found it in some papers I was looking through. I don't
have the attribution to hand. There was a shrunken "Sydney White
Pages" too.[CM]

    Waltzing Matilda
    ================
    Swaggie dreams of roast lamb dinner
     Passing jumbuck looks a winner
    Bags it, but here come the cops
     Into billabong he flops
    Drowns himself, forgoes hot roast
     Leaves the last waltz to his ghost
    "Sod the law" says our aquarian,
     "Better dead than vegetarian!"

13.2.2 "Advance Australia Fair", National Anthem

Australians all, let us rejoice,
For we are young and free,
We've golden soil and wealth for toil
Our home is girt by sea;
Our land abounds in nature's gifts
Of beauty rich and rare;
In hist'ry's page, let every stage
Advance Australia Fair.
In joyful strains then let us sing
'Advance Australia Fair.'

[Original second verse deleted, cos its all about the British :-) AN]

Beneath our radiant Southern Cross
We'll toil with hearts and hands,
To make this Commonwealth of ours
Renowned of all the lands,
For those who've come across the seas
We've boundless plains to share,
With courage let us all combine
to Advance Australia Fair.
In joyful strains then let us sing
'Advance Australia Fair.'

* A less respectful version [JD]

        Advance

Australians never had a choice,
Had they the eyes to see,
That any Royal could only spoil
Republic luxury;
With leaps and bounds opinion shifts,
Where most just couldn't care :
The silent rage, an equal wage,
And pinch-free underwear;
We'll raise a glass to anything,
You poms stay over there.


13.2.3 "And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda", Eric Bogle

When I was a young man I carried my pack
And I lived the free life of a rover 
From the Murray's green basin to the dusty outback,
   I waltzed my matilda over.
Then in nineteen fifteen my country said Son,
It's time to stop ramblin 'cos there work to be done,
So they gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun,
    and they sent me away to the war

And the band played Waltzing Matilda
As we sailed away from the Quay,
And amidst all the tears and the shouts and the cheers
We sailed off to Gallipoli.

How well I remember that terrible day
How the blood stained the sand and the water
And how in that town that they called Suvla Bay
We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter.
Johnny Turk he was ready, he primed himself well,
He chased us with bullets, he rained us with shells,
And in five minutes flat he'd blown us all to hell,
Nearly blew us right back to Australia.

But the band played Waltzing Matilda,
As we stopped to bury our slain,
We buried ours, and the Turks buried theirs,
Then we started all over again.

Now those that were left well we tried to survive,
In a mad world of blood death and fire,
And for ten weary weeks I kept myself alive,
But around me the corpses pile higher.
Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over tit,
And I woke up in my hospital bed,
I saw what it had done I wished I was dead,
Never knew there were worse things than dying.

For I'll go no more Waltzing Matilda
All around the green bush far and near
For to hump tents and pegs, a man needs both legs
No more Waltzing Mathilda for me.

So they collected the cripples, the wounded, the maimed
And they shipped us back home to Australia.
The armless, the legless, the blind and insane,
Those proud wounded heroes of Suvla.
And as our ship pulled into Circular Quay,
I looked at the place where my legs used to be,
And thanked Christ there was no one there waiting for me,
To grieve and to mourn and to pity.

And the band played Waltzing Matilda,
As they carried us down the gangway,
But nobody cheered, they just stood and stared,
Then turned all their faces away.

And now every April I sit on my porch,
And I watch the parade pass before me,
And I watch all my old comrades, how proudly they march
Renewing old dreams of past glory.
And the old men march slowly, all bent, stiff and sore,
The forgotten heroes from a forgotten war
And the young people ask, 'What are they marching for?'
And I ask myself the same question.

And the band played Waltzing Mathilda,
And the old men answer the call,
But year after year their numbers get fewer,
Some day no one will march there at all.

Let me Abos go loose, Lou
Let me Abos go loose.
They are of no further use Lou
Let me Abos go loose.

All together now, Chorus:

Tan me hide when I'm dead, Fred
Tan me hide when I'm dead.
So we tanned his hide when he died, Clyde
And that's it hangin on the shed.

In _Remembering Babylon_ David Malouf gives us a rich and compelling
novel, in language of astonishing poise and resonance, about the
settling of the continent down under, Australia, and the vicissitudes
of first contact with the unknown. In the mid-1840s a 13-year-old
cabin boy, Gemmy Fairley, is cast ashore from a British shipwreck onto
the Queensland coast, and is taken in by aborigines. Sixteen years
later, three children from a white settlement come upon this
apparition: "...."... Possessed of lyrical intensity and always
respectful of human complexity , Remembering Babylon tells the story
of Gemmy, and of his relation to the whites. Given shelter by the
McIvors, the family of the three children, he seems at first to have a
secure role in the settlement, but currents of fear and distrust
intensify. At once white and black, a man with a voice but unable to
speak the language, he confounds all categories that might explain
him. To everyone he meets .... Gemmy is a force of nature that both
fascinates and repels. He finds his own whiteness as unsettling in his
new world as the knowledge he brings with him of the savage, the
aboriginal. In his most accomplished novel to date,David Malouf has
written a powerful fiction, informed by a vision of eternal human
differences. Remembering Babylon is a brilliant mythopoeia of our
unending encounter with the Other.

School. AN], _Lucinda Brayford_, _The Cardboard Crown_, _Outbreak

* Frank Hardy: _Power without Glory_. Frank Hardy's compelling story
of corruption and political manipulation created violent controversy
on its first release and has excited and intrigued Australians ever
since.  Power Without Glory traces the rise of the ruthless John West
from his impoverished working-class beginnings in a Melbourne slum to
a position of great wealth and political influence. His rising public
dominance contrasts with the growing emptiness of his personal life,
where even family turn from him, estranged by his implacable and
pitiless pursuit of power. A startling expose of bribery, fear and
corruption in high places, Hardy's tale revealed the sordid world of
gambling, political intrigue and underworld depravity. Upon the book's
first publication he was accused of overstepping the fine line between
fiction and the depiction of real Australian people and events, and
was sued for libel.  The sensational legal battle which followed
created debate and outrage across the nation and, despite Hardy's
acquittal, the questions it raised remain unanswered today. [Made into

13.3.2 Poetry

* "My Country" by Dorothea McKellar [CP]

	The love of field and coppice, 
	Of green and shaded lanes,
	Of ordered woods and gardens
	Is running in your veins.
	Strong love of grey-blue distance,
	Brown streams and soft, dim skies-
	I know but cannot share it,
	My love is otherwise.

	I love a sunburnt country,
	A land of sweeping plains,
	Of ragged mountain ranges,
	Of droughts and flooding rains.
	I love her far horizons,
	I love her jewel-sea,
	Her beauty and her terror- 
	The wide brown land for me!

	The stark white ring-barked forests,
	All tragic to the moon,
	The sapphire-misted mountains,
	The hot gold hush of noon,
	Green tangle of the brushes
	Where lithe lianas coil,
	And orchids deck the tree-tops,
	And ferns the warm dark soil.

	Core of my heart, my country!
	Her pitiless blue sky,
	When, sick at heart, around us
	We see the cattle die -
	But then the grey clouds gather,
	And we can bless again
	The drumming of an army,
	The steady soaking rain.

	Core of my heart, my country!
	Land of the rainbow gold,
	For flood and fire and famine
	She pays us back threefold.
	Over the thirsty paddocks,
	Watch, after many days,
	The filmy veil of greenness
	That thickens as we gaze.

	An opal-hearted country,
	A wilful, lavish land -
	All you who have not loved her,
	You will not understand -
	Though earth holds many splendours,
	Wherever I may die,
	I know to what brown country
	My homing thoughts will fly.

* The Man From Snowy River, by A.B. (Banjo) Paterson [CP]

There was movement at the station, for the word had passed around
	that the colt from old Regret had got away,
And had joined the wild bush horses - he was worth a thousand pound,
	So all the cracks had gathered to the fray.
All the tried and noted riders from the stations near and far
	Had mustered at the homestead overnight,
For the bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are,
	And the stock-horse snuffs the battle with delight.

There was Harrison, who made his pile when Pardon won the cup,
	The old man with his hair as white as snow;
But few could ride beside him when his blood was fairly up -
	He would go wherever horse and man could go.
And Clancy of the Overflow came down to lend a hand,
	No better horseman ever held the reins;
For never horse could throw him while the saddle-girths would stand -
	He learnt to ride while droving on the plains.

And one was there, a stripling on a small and weedy beast;
	He was something like a racehorse undersized,
With a touch of Timor pony - three parts thoroughbred at least -
	And such as are by mountain horsemen prized.
He was hard and tough and wiry - just the sort that won't say die - 
	There was courage in his quick impatient tread;
And he bore the badge of gameness in his quick and fiery eye,
	And the proud and lofty carriage of his head.

But still so slight and weedy, one would doubt his power to stay,
	And the old man said, "That horse will never do
For a long and tiring gallop - lad, you'd better stop away,
	These hills are far too rough for such as you."
So he waited, sad and wistful - only Clancy stood his friend -
	"I think we ought to let him come," he said;
"I warrant he'll be with us when he's wanted at the end,
	For both his horse and he are mountain bred.

"He hails from Snowy River, up by Kosciusko's side,
	Where the hills are twice as steep and twice as rough;
Where a horse's hooves strike firelight from the flintstones every stride,
	The man that holds his own is good enough.
And the Snowy river riders on the mountains make their home,
	Where the river runs those giant hills between;
I have seen full many horsemen since I first commenced to roam,
	But nowhere yet such horsemen have I seen."

So he went: they found the horses by the big mimosa clump,
	they raced away towards the mountain's brow,
And the old man gave his orders, "Boys, go at them from the jump,
	No use to try for fancy riding now.
And, Clancy, you must wheel them, try and wheel them to the right.
	Ride boldly lad, and never fear the spills,
For never yet was rider that could keep the mob in sight,
	If once they gain the shelter of those hills."

So Clancy rode to wheel them - he was racing on the wing
	Where the best and boldest riders take their place,
And he raced his stock-horse past them and he made the ranges ring
	With the stockwhip, as he met them face to face.
Then they halted for a moment, while he swung the dreaded lash,
	But they saw their well-loved mountain full in view,
And they charged beneath the stockwhip with a sharp and sudden dash,
	And off into the mountain scrub they flew.

Then fast the horsemen followed, where the gorges deep and black,
	Resounded to the thunder of their tread,
And the stockwhips woke the echoes, and they fiercely answered back
	From cliffs and crags that beetled overhead.
And upward, ever upward, the wild horses held their way,
	Where mountain ash and kurrajong grew wide;
And the old man muttered fiercely, "We may bid the mob good day,
	NO man can hold them down the other side."

When they reached the mountain's summit, even Clancy took a pull -
	It well might make the boldest hold their breath;
The wild hop scrub grew thickly, and the hidden ground was full
	Of wombat holes, and any slip was death.
But the man from Snowy River let the pony have his head,
	And he swung his stockwhip round and gave a cheer,
And he raced him down the mountain like a torrent down its bed,
	While the others stood and watched in very fear.

He sent the flint-stones flying, but the pony kept his feet,
	He cleared the fallen timber in his stride,
And the man from Snowy River never shifted in his seat -
	It was grand to see that mountain horseman ride.
Through the stringybarks and saplings, on the rough and broken ground,
	Down the hillside at a racing pace he went;
And he never drew the bridle till he landed safe and sound
	At the bottom of that terrible descent.

He was right among the horses as they climbed the farther hill,
	And the watchers on the mountain, standing mute,
Saw him ply the stockwhip fiercely; he was right among them still,
	As he raced across the clearing in pursuit.
Then they lost him for a moment, where two mountain gullies met
	In the ranges - but a final glimpse reveals
On a dim and distant hillside the wild horses racing yet,
	With the man from Snowy River at their heels.

And he ran them single-handed till their sides were white with foam;
	He followed like a bloodhound on their track,
Till they halted, cowed and beaten; then he turned their heads for home,
	And alone and unassisted brought them back.
But his hardy mountain pony he could scarcely raise a trot,
	He was blood from hip to shoulder from the spur;
But his pluck was still undaunted, and his courage fiery hot,
	For never yet was mountain horse a cur.

And down by Kosciusko, where the pine-clad ridges raise
	Their torn and rugged battlements on high,
Where the air is clear as crystal, and the white stars fairly blaze
	At midnight in the cold and frosty sky,
And where around the Overflow the reed-beds sweep and sway
	To the breezes, and the rolling plains are wide,
The Man from Snowy River is a household word today,
	And the stockmen tell the story of his ride.

13.3.3 Children's Literature

[This section is very incomplete cos I don't have any of my kid's
books here in the US with me. Contributions welcome! AN]

The Billabong series, by Mary Grant Bruce. Set on a station called
Billabong late last century, story of brother and sister Jim and
Norah, and Jim's friend Wally. Treatment of aboriginals rather
paternal and racist these days, but I really enjoyed these yarns as a
kid.  Also by Mary Grant Bruce, _Possum_. [AN]

* Bruce Chatwin, _Songlines_: 'The Songlines emerge as invisible
pathways connecting up all over Australia: ancient tracks made of
songs which tell of the creation of the landi. The Aboriginals'
religious duty is ritually to travel the land, singing the Ancestors'
songs: singing the world into being afresh. _The Songlines_ is one
mans impassioned song' Sunday Telegraph.  [Highly recommended. AN]

* _My Place_, by Sally Morgan. Modern Australian women writing about
life as an aboriginal woman. Sally Morgan has also written an award
winning play, and painted some canvases that imo are the best in the
WA Gallery (which is quite well stocked). [RH]

* Two books about early colonial women:
(1) _The Women of Botany Bay: A Re Australian Society_, by Portia
Robin pp.  $16.95 paper.
(2) _Life Lines: Australian Women's Lives 1788 to 1840_, edited
by Patricia Clark and Dale Spender. Sydney, NSW: Allen and Unwin,
1992, 249 pp.  @22.95 paper (US distribution: Paul & Co., PO Box
442, Concord, MA 01742).

* I recommend Paul Kelly's _The end of certainty_ for a chronicling of
the relationship between economic and social policies in the Liberal
Party.  It seems to Kelly that Howard was the one to try and introduce
social conservatism into the Libs to match the economic shift.
Hewson, it appears, is so narrowly focused on the economy (laser-like
anyone?) that this is now irrelevant. [PR]

childhood, after he was crippled at a young age by polio. A classic.
He wrote several other autobiographical works, and a number of them,
including "I can ..." were made into a TV series by the ABC)

* Albert Facey, _A Fortunate Life_. This is the extraordinary life of
an ordinary man. It is the story of Albert Facey, who lived with
simple honesty, compassion and courage. A parentless boy who started
work at eight on the rough West Australian frontier, he struggled as
an itinerant rural worker, survived the gore of Gallipoli, the loss of
his farm in the Depression, the death of his son in WWII and that of
his beloved wife after sixty devoted years - yet felt that his life
was fortunate.  Facey's life story, published when he was
eighty-seven, has inspired many as a play , a television series and an
award-winning book that has sold over 1/2 a million copies.  [Moving
and unforgettable.AN]

* Stan Arneil. _One Man's War_. The diary of a young Australian army
sergeant, Stan Arneil, kept as a prisoner of war duing WWII.  It
covers the entire period of imprisonment from the fall of Singapore in
1941 through the infamous Burma railway camps, his return to Changi

other awards, he has been International Reporter of the Year, and
winner of the United Nations Association Media Peace Prize.  John
Pilger writes about his homeland with life-long affection and a
passionately critical eye. In A Secret Country he pays tribute to a
little known Australia and tells a story of high political drama.

-"Tenaciously researched, fiercely argued, both unsparing and
patriotic, A Secret Country presents a harsh narrative of class,
race and power; of the oppression and resistance, the betrayal
and amnesia, that lie behind the sunny illusions of the
Australian self-image" Robert Hughes.
-"A moving account of the abuse of human rights in Australia' Graham
Greene
- "This is a patriotic book in the best sense, written in the belief
that Australia deserves not old bromides and stereotypes, but the
respect of critical appraisal.  With _The Fatal Shore_ by Robert
Hughes, it is an essential text for anyone wishing to understand the
real Australia obscured by the advertising industry's image of a
nation of 'white Anglo-Saxon Crocodile Dundees with the wit of the
cast of _Neighbours_'. It is also a necessary book for those of us who
believe in the redeeming power of truth. Daily Telegraph, London.
-"He reveals a hidden Australia at once more ugly and more heroic than
the official history... Combining investigative journalism with
whimsical anecdote, it's a powerful critique of Australian society and
a bloody good read."  Australian Tribune.

* Paul Kelly, _The Hawke Ascendancy_ is the story of how the Labor
Party returned to power in 1983 after its crushing defeat in1975.  It
is the inside story of three men- Bob Hawke, Malcolm Fraser and Bill
Hayden - and their unique power struggle. The account covers the full
eight years which began with Fraser's 1975 supremacy and closed with
Hawke's 1983 triumph and first year of office.

13.4 Films 

From the Sunday "New York Times", Jan 2nd 1994 [AT]:

"Perhaps the closest parallel to the vitality of Ireland's movie
industry today is the Australian experience of the late 1970s. In a
period of just a few years, the Australians gave the world
"Gallipoli," "Breaker Morant," "My Brilliant Career," "Picnic at
Hanging Rock" and "The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith." Critics slavered
over the output of directors like Peter Weir, Bruce Beresford, Fred
Scepisi & Gillian Armstrong. "'Crocodile' Dundee," the ultimate in
outback machismo, established box-office records in both Australia and
the United States, where it was the 2nd-highest-grossing movie of
1986.

The success of these films changed the image of the country that
produced them. Suddenly, Australians loomed large as a force in the
movie world.  ...

..Soon after they made their mark, nearly all the best-known
Australian directors scampered off to Hollywood. The mighty Australian
film industry faltered -- partly because of recession & unemployment
but also because its proficient pool of talent opted for the bigger
budgets and wider distribution offered by the studios."

	Period dramas of WW1 in the Middle East.  The Australian Light
	Horse, the charge at Beersheeba, etc.
Mad Dog Morgan
	Bushrangers.

Mad Max (1979) Dir. George Miller. Mel Gibson. In the desolate near
future, the police have their hands full keeping roads safe from
suicidally daring drivers and roving gangs. Top cop Gibson tires and
quits, but when his wife and child are murdered by vicious cyclists,
he embarks on high-speed revenge. Weird atmosphere and characters
combine with amazing stunt work in this remarkable action film.
        
Mad Max 2 (The Road Warrior) (1981) Sequel finds Max, now a loner,
reluctantly helping a tiny oil-producing community defend itself against
band of depraved crazies thirsty for precious fuel. Far less original
script-wise, but trend-setting visual design and some of the most
unbelievable car stunts ever filmed make this equal to, if not better
than the original.

Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985) Tina Turner. Mad Max comes upon
Turner's cutthroat city of Bartertown, survives a battle-to-the-death
in the Roman-style Thunderdome, and is exiled to the desert where he
is rescued by a tribe of wild children.  Lots of stunts and action,
and even some philosophical moments, but lacks kinetic energy.
        
The Man From Snowy River (1982) Dir George Miller. Kirk Douglas, Tom
Burlinson, Sigrid Thornton, Lorraine Bayley. Grand, old-fashioned
Western-style saga, based on epic poem, about strong-willed young man
who goes to work for an empire-building cattleman, and falls in love
with his daughter. Kokey, simplistic, but great fun, with eye-filling
scenery of the Snowy Mountains and incredible action scenes with some
wild horse.  Thompson cameo role as Clancy of the Overflow.

	Kennedy, Graeme Blundell.
	"You could set your watch to this fucking rain." :-)

Return to Snowy River, Part II
Walk Into Hell

We of the Never Never (1983) Angela Punch McGregor.  True story based
on the memoirs of the first white woman to travel into Australian
inland wilderness (known as the Never Never). Visually stunning.

COMEDY

Bliss (1985) High-powered businessman has a major heart attack, sees
himself dying, the revives - which changes his entire outlook on life.
After a dynamic opening this stylized satire slows to a snail's pace
and loses its thrust.  Australian Academy award winner and international
film festival favourite.

The Cars That Ate Paris (1974) Peter Weir. The poor people of Paris
(Paris, Australia) keep the economy going by inducing traffic
accidents and selling the spare parts/scrap metal.  Iffy black comedy
has its moments. (in US released as The Cars That Eat People?)

"Crocodile" Dundee (1986) Paul Hogan. Amiable, laid-back comedy (that
became an enormous world-wide hit) about an adventurer who shows a
pretty American reporter around the bush country, then accompanies her
to the equally strange terrain of New York City.  Irresistibly simple
and old-fashioned, with a sweetness that's rare in modern comedies.
[Unfortunately this is all most Americans know about Australia. AN]

"Crocodile" Dundee II (1988) Sequel, not too bad.

Don's Party (1976) Bruce Beresford. Powerful black comedy about the
interaction - sexual and otherwise - about a group of young
suburbanites who get together to watch election returns. Stunning
direction, superb performances by all; biting script by David
Williamson, from his play.

Flirting: director John Duigan

Malcolm (1986) Charming, disarmingly off-beat comedy about a
slow-witted young man with a genius for mechanical devices and his
unusual entry into a life of crime. Australian film institute winner
for best Picture.

Norman Loves Rose (1982) Ok comedy of teenager Owen who becomes
enamoured with sister-in-law Kane. She becomes pregnant and who is the
father?

Rikky and Pete (1988) Pete is a misfit with a penchant for gimmicky
inventions, Rikki is his sister who is still trying to find herself;
together they flee to a remote mining town where their lives take some
unexpected turns. Followup to Malcolm by the same director and writer,
hasn't the same sweetness or consistency but it's admirably quirky.

Strictly Ballroom.  Scott Hastings (Paul Mercurio), one of Australia's
best ballroom dancers, is on-target for a number of championships
until he starts to dance from the heart, abandoning the Dance
Federation's rigid steps in favour of his own moves.  His partner Liz
(Gia Carides) leaves him and Scott is forced to take up with an
amateur.  Fran (Tara Morice) matches Scott's zest for life, but one
question hangs over them as they teach each other about life, love,
and dancing: can they win by rejecting tradition?

Touch and Go (1980)

Young Einstein (1988) Nutty comedy based on the premise that Einstein
not only developed the theory of relativity, but invented rock 'n
roll. The silliness continues from there... but any movie that
contains 'cat pies' can't be all bad.

The Year my Voice Broke:director John Duigan

* Hunters and Collectors

They're a Melbourne band who've been around for well over ten years
now and they've changed their style a hell of a lot since they
started. In the early 80s they brought out this weird sounding album
called Hunters & Collectors which was characterized by a metallic
percussion from a huge metal cannister or something they used to drag
up on stage with them.

At some stage they moved to England and made an album called Judas
Sheep which they seem to be pretty embarrassed about now I think.
Mark Seymour, the singer, said it contains some of the most
pretentious lyrics he's ever written. I think the next album, made
after having moved back to Oz, was The Jaws of Life, which is close to
my favourite album. It's really, um, almost crude, and is full of
chant-like lyrics and sounds great, but probably takes some getting
used to. I like especially the songs 'The Jaws of Life' which touches
on an incident in the Northern Territory where a truck driver ploughed
into a pub (on purpose?) and killed some people, and 'Betty's Worry or
The Slab' which is about masturbation.

Another really good album is Human Frailty. The singing on this album
is really good - the harmonics. 'Throw Your Arms Around Me' became a
really well known song in Oz.  Then came What's A Few Men, which I
really like too: good lyrics, good singing. After that, I think, came
Ghost Nation, and then they released 'Collected Works' which has songs
from every album except Judas Sheep, and a remix of Throw Your Arms
Around Me.  They brought out an album a couple of years ago called,
um, shit, now I#ve forgotten, something monosyllabic. I didn't like
that album as much the earlier stuff but that's just a matter of
taste. There may be a new album after that, or on the way.

* Aboriginal music

[JO] The band Outback does a good job of the didgerido, and they're
now on Ryko.  They used to be on Hannibal Records.  Second is Trance
Mission, with their self-titled album on City of Tribes records.  They
use clarinet, too...  it's real strange, but it grows on you.  Lastly,
you've heard of Steve Roach, haven't you?  :) He's been on several
labels, and I'm not sure which he's with now.  But just about anything
he does -- except maybe Empetus -- there's probably a didgeridoo in it.

* Didgeridos [PW]

Firstly, how to get a sound.  With brass instruments, you make a sound
by vibrating both lips into a mouthpiece.  With a didj though, you are
only supposed to vibrate your top lip, keeping the bottom one still.
Having played the trombone for about 7 years, I found it quite easy to
get a sound somewhat similar to a kid blowing down a vacuum cleaner
hose (or a plastic pipe for that matter).  It took me a bit of time to
get a proper type of sound but when I did, I found I used a lot less
air, and could manipulate the sound far more.  Then again, having
played the trombone, I was used to the principles of manipulating my
mouth (just ask the wief ;-].  Effects such as "dingo calls" are
achieved by making a noise with your vocal-chords at the same time as
the drone with your lips.  This also takes a bit of practice !

Secondly, circular breathing.  This I have not yet tried with much
conviction but I'll get around to it real soon now !  The basic
principle is that you puff your cheeks up, block off the back of your
mouth with your tongue, and then breath in your nose while pulling
your cheeks in to expell air through your mouth.  Blocking the back of
the mouth can be done by raising the back of the tongue to the top of
the mouth.  It helps a bit to push your tongue forward as you pull
your cheeks in to get a bit more pressure.  Also, don't try this with
your mouth wide open - you need a small gap in your lips to keep the
pressure up.  The book I have also suggests getting a straw with a
twist in it, putting the end in a glass of water and blowing through
it.  This way you can see if you are breathing properly (and you
really know it if you breath in your mouth instead of your nose :-).

Thirdly, if you can't hear the instrument very well because it's
pointing away from you, put the end into an open cardboard box - it
makes a huge difference.  Unfortunately, my wife doesn't appreciate
the empty box in the middle of the living room floor .....
