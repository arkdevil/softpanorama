SUBJECT: Californian Antivirus Law

Hello, everybody!

About a month ago I posted a message in which I mentioned that in California 
there is a law particularly against the virus writers. Some people responded 
that this is not true. However, I didn't suck the history from my fingers. Here 
is the full quote from "Computer Fraud & Security Bulletin", ISSN 0142-0496, 
December 1989, p. 2:

                    Californian Crack-Down

     The US state of California has enacted a law making it illegal for anyone 
to deliberately plant a destructive computer virus in a computer network. The 
new laws also allow courts to confiscate the equipment owned by someone charged 
with a computer offence. Should the person be convicted, the equipment is then 
forfeited to the state, and that person can be ordered not to work with access 
to a computer.

     Federal laws have already been enacted to to cover computer crime, but are 
not so tough or far-reaching as the Californian laws. According to Ken 
Rosenblatt, the only way to prevent computer crime is to deter people. 
Rosenblatt heads the Santa Clara Country district attorney's high technology 
unit, and helped to develop some of the new laws. These laws will take effect on 
1 January.

As far as I understand this stuff, by now, any person that intentionally spreads 
a destructive virus in California, can be convicted. Any comments?

Regards,
Vesselin
