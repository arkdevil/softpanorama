Hi, Peter !

This is a quote from the documentation of SCAN v66b:

---- cut me here ----

        VIRUSCAN will perform both an internal and an external scan
on programs that are compressed with LZEXE.  The compressed file
will first be scanned externally and then it will be automatically
de-compressed and scanned again for an internal infection.  The
/NLZ option will disable the decompression and internal scan
function.

---- cut me here ----

So, SCAN does check files compressed with LZEXE but if other 
compressors were used, it wont.

PS: RTFM :-), it's all in the doc file for SCAN v66b.

Best regards, Michael
