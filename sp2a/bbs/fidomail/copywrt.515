   Yes.
   The key word in Frank's message is not "copyright" but "claim." 
Anyone can "claim" copyright of virus search strings or claim his 
horse is a cow.
   Copyright is, indeed, a right. It can neither be granted (except, 
in a loose interpretation of that word, be "confirmed" in a court 
battle) nor can it be lost (despite notices by authors saying they 
relinquish their copyright). The US and international copyright 
standards are simple. You write something (a "work"), whether a 
computer program or a letter to your Mom, for example, and it's 
copyright. End of statement. That is your RIGHT, and the right may 
only be relinquished by specifically giving/selling ("assigning") it 
to someone or something else.
   Yes, yes, I know some countries have different laws and standards 
-- I live in one. But the above covers the US, most of Europe and 
much of the rest of the world.
   Neither McAfee nor anyone else can OWN the copyright on virus 
strings for two very good and specific reasons:
   1. He didn't write them.
   2. They are too short to copyright i.e., they are not "works." You 
cannot copyright a book title or the name of a watch, either.
   But he CAN "claim" copyright all he wants. It would be a VERY 
short court case if he ever tried to enforce it, of course.
   Hope this helps to clear the muddy waters a little bit.
