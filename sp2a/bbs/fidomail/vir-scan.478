Well, Kurt Goedel, a German matematician, poved that in every axiomatic system 
there exists hypoteses that cannot be proved using only the axioms of the 
axiomatic system. For instance, the hypothese "There is only one line, paralel 
to a given line, that passes through a point not on the given line" cannot be 
proven only with the aid of the geometry's axioms. Those theorems might be 
provable in a meta-set of axioms. However, there's no constructive way to 
determine the minimal meta-set of axioms. The easiest way is to state that the 
hypotese is true and to consider it as an axiom along with the previous ones and 
to say that they form the required meta-set. (Sorry if I was unable to explain 
all this clearly, but my English is not so good.)

Nope, but you can replace it. :-) Jokes aside, one virus writer in Varna told me 
that he'll burn a virus-spreading program in an EPROM and will install this 
EPROM on some PCs in order to make them spead viruses. :-(
