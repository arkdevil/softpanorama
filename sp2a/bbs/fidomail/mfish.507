That is not stupid. An infected non-bootable disk is also able to infect
other systems. The routine that displays the message "Non-bootable disk"
can also be replaced by a routine that infects the harddisk of your
system. And how many times do we forget to open the door of the drive
before we reboot? Infected non-bootable disks are very dangerous....
