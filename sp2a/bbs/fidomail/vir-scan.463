Not true. Even if the file I/O time is constant, you cannot object to the fact 
that the time that the program needs is proportional to the number of strings 
being scanned for. And don't forget that we're only in the beginning of the 
virus era. Now we have under 250 viruses, some time later we'll have 250,000... 
It's true that TBSCAN is very fast now (and maybe can be made even faster) but 
when the number of scan strings increases by several orders, the scan time will 
become more and more noticeable... until it becomes too long for the program to 
be used. And have you noticed that the old viruses (those marked as "Extinct" in 
Merry's document), that cannot be found almost anywhere, are also scanned for by 
all virus scanners? Have you seen many Lehigh infections? However, it's not safe 
to remove the check for this virus (better safe than sorry :-)).
