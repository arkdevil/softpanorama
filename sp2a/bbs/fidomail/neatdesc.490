SUBJECT: A virus description scheme

Hello, everybody!

The next two messages contain an attempt for a formal description of computer 
viruses. The method itself is invented by the Russian antivirus researcher 
Bezrukov. I only improved it a bit and translated it into English.

We really need a method that can describe a computer virus in a singular way. It 
must guarantee that one and the same virus, described by two different 
researchers will have one and the same description; and that two different 
viruses will have two different descriptions.

The proposed method is only an approach for this goal; it's not perfect. I'm 
waiting for your opinions how to improve it.

BTW, if you want to contact Bezrukov, here's his address:
