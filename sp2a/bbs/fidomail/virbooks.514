But, really, I think a major point is being overlooked here, and it's 
because participants in this echo, like every echo, are so deep into 
the forest themselves -- and that is NOT a criticism. Most (unstupid) 
users feel that viruses are aimed at them from outside, and that the 
people who aim them (the virus writers) have no business aiming them.
   In other words, I (and most folks) didn't buy a computer to play a 
game with some unknown person with the following rules:
   1. If I win, I get to keep my computer, all programs and all data, 
as well as peace of mind.
   2. If I lose, I don't get to keep my computer . . . etc.
   Like the Vietnamese peasants and the Kuwaitis and the Afghanis and 
the Kurds and like MOST people in the world, computer users and 
owners don't want to be BOTHERED. And viruses bother them. So does 
learning about viruses. Afghanis didn't and don't WANT to know about 
the benefits of a socialist paradise; they wanted the Russians to go 
home. The Kurds didn't and don't want to know about . . . and so on.
   The line in this thread is that "computer users have to learn 
about viruses to protect themselves." But they won't. Just like 
frequent flyers didn't learn about terrorists' doctrine and the 
Kuwaitis aren't going to learn to like Iraqi television programs. 
They
simply
won't
do it.
   You and I have found a fascinating world of viruses. MOST people 
aren't interested, and you can't force them to be interested. People 
WILL put this off on the government, as they already are doing in 
Europe and now in America. As they did with aircraft hijacking, the 
Russian invasion of Afghanstan and the Iraqi problem. Once they have 
put it off on the government, then only the direct victims of a virus 
attack will care, and THEY will blame the government. This thread is 
a number of converted people talking to their peers.
   The people out there don't CARE about this echo, although a few of 
them will be grateful to one of us when we save his/her bacon one day 
on an infected computer. And grateful they may be, but they still 
won't learn about viruses -- they'll only be grateful an expert in 
the dark arts was available. Trust me.
