What exactly? Why it's unsafe to use piece of Scatch, or why it's unsafe to use 
a black write-protecting tab?

The first thing is unsafe, because some dirves use a light beam that has to PASS 
THROUGH the write-protecting hole in order to consider the diskette NOT 
write-protected. Most kinds of Scotch (even the non-transparent ones) let enough 
light to pass through them, so the drive will think that the diskette is not 
protected.

The second think is unsafe, because some drives (they are *very* rare, but they 
exist) use a light beam that has to REFLECT on the write-protecting tab and to 
return BACK in order to consider the diskette write-protected. If the beam does 
not reflect due to the black tab, the diskette is consider as NOT 
write-protected. I repeat, these drives are very, very rare, but better safe 
than sorry.
