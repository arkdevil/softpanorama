SUBJECT: Hacker intercepts viruses

Hello, everybody!

I found the following in "Computers & Security", Vol. 9 (1990), 4, p. 294. It's 
at the end of the article "Random Bits and Bytes" by Prof. Harold Joseph 
Highland, FICS.

<begin of the quote>

We received a telephone call in mid-March from a local hacker who informed us 
that he too had a disk of new viruses. He indicated that he was in the 
"pipeline" to receive illegal copies of virus disks sent by John McAfee to his 
researchers. The code for two of the viruses was garbled and asked that we 
please send him corrected copies of these two viruses.

<end of the quote>

I strongly urge some of the McAfee's group to comment the above message.

Regards,
Vesselin
