SUBJECT: A virus description scheme

Hello, Vesselin !

Nice to have you around again :-)

I think there is a simple test for such a language:

Take two virus researchers that are not in contact with each other.
Send each of them six viruses cultivated in a standard environment
(let's play it the easy way, let's choose six COM-file infectors), the
documentation for a virus description scheme (rules etc.) and let them
create descriptions of the six viruses. Then, compare the six
descriptions to each other. If they don't match, forget about the
scheme :-)

At a point last year, Morton and I had also developed something
very similar. Then, the thoughts expressed in the previous paragraph
appeared in our minds and we trashed our scheme :-(


Best regards,

Michael
