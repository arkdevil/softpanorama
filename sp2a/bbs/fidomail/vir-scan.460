Hi Frans;

It is personal, but in general, debugging of an assembler program 
takes more time.

No need for, it is a joy discussing with you.

Like I said in my first message, the algorithm is most important. I 
still believe that.

I agree.

Hmm, now I have to think again?

Also BTW, I already working at it. In the next release, in Beta-test 
now, could be available next week, I support LOW en HIGH scanning in 
memory. I accept, let us learn from each other and kill the viruses. 
(Maybe the writers too!) Besides, I like discussions like this.
