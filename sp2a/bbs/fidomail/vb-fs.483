PHOENIX is 1704 bytes long. They were probably infected by the Evil virus which 
is 1701 bytes. Please, let the virus decrypt itself and check. The PHOENIX virus 
has the string "PHOENIX" in it, while the Evil virus contains the message "The 
Evil that men do lives on and on...".

So, I was right to worry about! This mad maniac, the Dark Avenger, is really a 
*&%#$@ !

BTW, Fridrik, did you get my NetMail? I have the feeling that I cannot establish 
a two-way contact with you. Do you read this echo regularly? I sent you a 
diskette, containing a PC-DES encrypted ZIP archive with the new Bulgarian 
viruses. (I used the same password again. Do you still remember it? :-)) I sent 
it as a recomended letter and they told me (at the post office) that it may take 
up to 5 weeks to arrive to you. If you want a more expeditive way to recive new 
viruses, I have to convince myself that you can receive NetMail from me without 
problems.

Regards,
Vesselin
