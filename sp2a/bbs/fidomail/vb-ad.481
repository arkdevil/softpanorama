But you MUST have a kind of command interpreter (or shell or something like 
that) that accepts your commands and loads/runs the executable files.

Maybe I cannot understand, but I mean that a virus can (and often, very often, 
unfortunately, does) carry destructive code in itself. If it can spread by 
itself, then it's a virus. It doesn't matter whether it contains a trojan code 
or not.
