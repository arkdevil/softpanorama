Hi, Costas!

 CL>   Can anybody suggest an anti-virus which can do the following:

What exactly is Jerusalem 3? McAfee uses letters to mark the different variants 
of this virus; is this Jerusalem C? Is it similar to the Jerusalem B? If the 
latter is true, just send me an example of the virus and I'll design a curing 
utility, presto.

 CL> b) Clear the Dark Avenger without ruining the disk's data?

Yes, my program EDDIECLR.COM does this. It can be requested from Danbo (2:359/1) 
or from MicroComm (2:359/101), I think. If you cannot find it, drop me a 
message, and I'll send it to you via NetMail in uuencoded form.

The problem is, however, that the Dark Avenger virus itself destroys data. Every 
16th time an infected program is run, it overwrites a random sector of the disk 
with the first 512 bytes of its own code. If this sector happen to be part of a 
file, the file is irreparably damaged. The program that I mentioned is able to 
find these files and to delete them, if requested.

Hope the above helps.

Vesselin
