Hey, that's an idea! I haven't thought about that... So, when we'll see a virus 
scanner that uses a hashed table of search strings? (John McAfee?) Anyway, 
hashing is most appropriate when you have a large, but sparse search space. I 
really cannot see how it can help when you have a lot of strings to search for. 
You have to search for every one of them. Any ideas?

Nobody is perfect... :-)

Isn't it in Vol. 3 ("Sorting and Searching")? Volume 2 was dedicated to the 
"seminumerical" algorithms...

Oh, I have them in Russian translation. They're quite difficult for reading, 
though. Why didn't Donald Knuth use a more "nice" language for algorithm 
description?! The instruction set of that "MIX" looks terrible... :-( BTW, I 
have heard that he seriously thinks to write finally the fourth volume. Do you 
know something about that?
