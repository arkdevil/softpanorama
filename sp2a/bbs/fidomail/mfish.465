Hey, and how about me? I didn't get it :-(. Seriously, the last evening I got a 
phone call from Dr. Allan Solomon (the author of "Dr. Solomon's Antivirus 
Toolkit") who confirmed that he has a copy of this virus. If it was you who 
provided the examples to the antivirus researchers, thanks - you did a good job.

Yes, that's right. Late information is often better than wrong information (or 
disinformation). I'm sure that when the virus is disassembled and understood 
(Dr. Solomon told me that it's extremely hard to disassemble it), the 
information what it does, how to detect and recognize it, and how to remove it 
will be made widely available.
