Hi, Patrick !

I strongly disagree with you on that point. The MFV is a program that 
can execute on a finite state machine. Therefore - given advanced 
hardware debugging equipment, chip-level documentation of the machine 
and qualified programmers are available - it MUST be possible 
reverse-engineer it (given that if it uses 'binary' composition 
techniques, all 'parts' are available etc etc)... 

Best regards, Michael

PS: Still, you are right stating that this might take longer than 
with the 'standard' viruses :-( We're on the way...
