Sure, you're right that it's very difficult to decide such things. When I went 
in Munich and for the first time of my life was able to communicate with the 
antivirus researchers all over the world, I decided to consider "trustworth" 
(sp?) those of them, whose papers I have read in several serious journals - 
"Computers & Security", "BYTE", "Datamation", "Computer Fraud & Security 
Bulletin"... At that time these included Ken van Wyk, Harold Highland, Ross 
Greenberg, John McAfee, Dave Chess, Yisrael Radai, Fridrik Skulason.

Hmm, another difficult question. It has more to do with ethics than with the 
antivirus research. In the beginning of the virus era I thought that ALL 
information should be made widely available - because those that have the mental 
formation to write viruses already know how to do it (or will find it anyway) 
and the people have to know what to expect. I was even stupid enough to make a 
diskette that contained the Vienna virus (the only virus in Bulgaria at that 
time) an a disinfector for it and to copy it to whoever wished, for educational 
purposes. Of course, this was wrong. Fortunately, it didn't cause much damage. 
Now I restrict much more the information I make widely available. However even 
now there are people that say that I publish too much sensitive information 
about viruses. Of course, we can argue about this till the end of our lives. 
Anyway, none of the productive virus writers in my country - T.P. (48 versions 
of his virus), Dark Avenger (at least 13 different viruses), P.D. (a virus 
writer from Plovdiv; 4-5 viruses, some of them - with 7-8 versions) used any of 
the information I published.

No problem. :-)

Good idea. Now let's hope that some kind soul (maybe Merry) will provide this 
"message log file" to Daniel, from where I'll be able to download it.
