Well, it seems we have a different idea of the word 'disassemble'. Of 
course, any piece of code can be disassembled - even text files can be 
loaded into DEBUG and "disassembled" :-), but the resulting assembler 
instructions would be senseless. If a program employs time-dependant 
encryption techniques to hide itself away from debuggers, hardware 
tools might be necesssary to create a disassembly that makes sense. 
Something similar can be said about encryption routines that utilize 
low-level hardware to decrypt themselves: If you don't have the doc's, 
it is hard to understand what's happening.

I don't doubt your ability.

I am sure a number of us will be able to disassemble "Mother Fish". It 
might just take some time :-)

PS: The "binary" virus concept really worries me. If one virus carries 
another virus in it's body (in encrypted form) and a different virus 
carries the decryption routine or key, it is *NOT* possible to make 
sense of the encrypted code unless the "matching" decryptor virus is 
available. Imagine a pseudo-evolutionary virus that would employ such 
features. A nightmare :-(
