Nope, you misspelled my name :-). I agree that it's quite difficult, though. 
Maybe I have to use a handle? :-)

Feel free to do so.

I generally provide McAfee (and, with some delay, Fridrik Skulason) with 
examples of every new virus in Bulgaria. You can get these viruses from them.

In general, I don't insist on receiving viruses. Of course, I'll appreciate if 
you send me those that I still don't have. However, we have to agree on a safe 
way to do this. For instance, you can send them via NetMail (crash) to Daniel 
Kalchev (2:359/1) and he'll forward them to me. It would be nice if we agree on 
a password too.

I don't know; I don't have a copy of it.

Dr. Alan Solomon told me that he has a copy of this virus. You can get it from 
him.
