Yeah, the "Frodo virus" is an alias of 4096 (because it contains a boot sector 
which, if installed to a diskette, would display the message "Frodo Lives" on 
boot). There are many programs that disinfect from this virus; you can ask the 
people in this conference that are from Israel (4096 is a common virus there). 
Also McAfee's CLEAN will help too, I think.

No, running CHKDSK when the virus is active in memory will display file 
allocation errors.

Hope the above helps.
