SUBJECT: Bulgarian Virus Writers

Hello Paul,

    Let's hope Vesselin will reply too, as he has more time to think of their 
motives - for me all they are a bit of brain-damaged. :-)

In a message of <Sep 18 12:51> Paul Ferguson (1:204/869) writes:

In the first instance, you should note, that before, you were not able to 
receive samples of our viruses. Most of the viruses, that "appear" now are in 
fact written a years ago.

In my opinion, the most accountable reason for writting viruses in my conuntry 
is the lack of copyright law here. This bothers MANY people, who think their 
programming skills are better that others and are not willing to work for PD. 
Such people usualy expect their effort to result in imeediate income, which 
obviously should not be expenced in a country like ours - the state 
firms were encouraged to pirate foreign software...

There are some political points, that appeared recently - the life become less 
stable and for people will ill mentaility, this is a good environment...

One more thing, that produced a LOT of viruses is Vesselin's politic of 
spreading information about viruses. (sorry, Veso :-). This was done via the 
only computer magazine in Bulgaria, a magazine which most serious people just 
ignore due to it's naive contents. Some people were really bothered by the fact, 

that Vesselin get paid for those articles (which is obvious). Of course, they 
haven't the tallent, nor the intention to write such articles in that *** 
magazine (by their understanding). All this lead to a war between Vesselin (as 
the main culprit) and other people who fight viruses (but preffer not to be so 
well known - like me) on the one side and virus writter on the other. There are 
viruses especially designed to stop Vesselin's programs. When SCAN appeared in 
Bulgaria, or more precisely when it become known (when I run my Fido node), they 

discovered a possibility all their efforts to be lost... Moreover, most of their 

current viruses appear to be discovered by SCAN in a strange way. :-)

Oh, I will better stop here. I am deadly tired and can produce some stupid 
sentence. More next time. :-)

Regards from Varna,
Daniel
