SUBJECT: COMMERCIAL MESSAGE

   I've been following this echo for a couple of weeks.  A couple of
messages have mentioned hardware write protection for hard drives with
a price of about $150.  It happens that I work for a company that sells,
among other things, such a device for about $75.  
   The write protect device is described, along with a review of some
of the pros and cons of using it in a file that I've uploaded to a few
BBS around the country.  The file name is VIRUS.TXT 73,769 bytes, or
VIRUS.ZIP 28,989 bytes.  I know that it is on Speed of Light BBS (205)
262 3735 and on & The Temple of the Screaming Electron (415) 935 5845.
   A moment's thought will reveal that a hardware write protect is not
quite as simple as a switch in the write gate line.  The interrupted
line can not simply be allowed to float, since it might float to the
"write" state at any inconvienient moment.
   In addition, it would be nice to reflect a signal back on the write
fault line, so that the host adapter, the BIOS, and DOS all know that
the write failed, and they can take appropriate action.
   It would also be nice to let the human user know that a write has
been attempted so that he (or she) can decide if something sinister is
going on.
   Anyway, I don't know if I'm violating the rules by bring all this
up, but it seems relevent.
