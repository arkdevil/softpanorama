I understand you, but I cannot agree with you. (1) If you gave your friend the 
source code of a program, then what's wrong if he uses it? If you don't want 
your code to be used, you must not give it. (2) How you can ensure that the 
viruses you wrote will clear only the target disk and not the one of a 
completely innocent person that was infected by your friend's diskettes?
