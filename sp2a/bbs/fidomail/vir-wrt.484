I already answered a similar question. In summary: the economical/political 
situation in our country is favorable. We have a lot of *very* skilled and young 
programmers that have nothing serious to do, because they are not paid well 
enough. Simultaneously, they are not morally grown. They pass their time to 
investigate the computer and to play jokes with it and with other people. 
Another reason is that they want publicity. I'm widely known as an antivirus 
researcher in Bulgaria, and as an author of virus-related articles in our 
computer magazine. Most of the virus writers I know personally have contacted me 
and have sent me examples of their viruses because they know that I'll write 
about their creations.

The mad maniac that names himself "Dark Avenger" is another case; in fact I 
think that he's a medical case :-). He just loves to destroy other people's work 
and writes more and more elaborated viruses partially in order to defeat my 
antivirus programs. Maybe he considers this as some kind of contest.

Vesselin
