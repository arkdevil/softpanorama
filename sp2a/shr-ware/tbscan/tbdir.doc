
TBDIR 1.0
---------

Tbdir is a simple directory lister. It has however an unique feature. By
using the same "direct-dos" technique as used in TBSCAN it is able to
display the real size of an infected file. No virus that can fool Tbdir.

As an extra security, Tbdir also displays the seconds of the file's
timestamp. If a virus marks a file as being infected by setting the
seconds of the timestamp to an invalid value, you will able to detect
it.

We attempted to keep the behaviour of the directory program equal to
that of DOS. For better readability we convert the filenames to
lowercase.

Two parameters are supported:

/P pause after one screen of information. Of course, the
number of lines of your screen has been taken in account.

/R install the resident part. If you specify this parameter, Tbdir will
become resident, and will replace the original DOS command. Using "dir"
will invoke Tbdir automatically.
