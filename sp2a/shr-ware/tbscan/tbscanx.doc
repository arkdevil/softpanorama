DESCRIPTION TBSCANX
-------------------

    TBSCANX is a program that was developed to trace viruses, Trojan
    Horses and other threats to your valuable data. It is a so-called
    virus scanner.

    A virus scanner is a program that is able to search a signature that
    has been determined beforehand. Most viruses consist of a unique
    signature, so by means of checking for the appearance of this
    signature we can see whether or not a program has been infected.

    By searching all your program files for the signatures of all
    viruses already identified you can easily find whether your system
    has been infected and, if that is the case, with which virus.

    By now already lots of virus scanners have been developed. The
    problem with all these scanners is that you have to execute them.
    Suppose you have the virusscanner automatically invoked in your
    autoexec.bat file. If no viruses are found, your system is supposed
    to be uninfected. But, to be sure that no virus can infect your
    system, you have to run the scanner every time before you copy a
    file to your harddisk, after donwloading a file from your BBS, or
    after unarchiving an archive such as a ZIP file. Be honest, do YOU
    actually invoke your scanner every time?

    TBSCANX has a unique feature to overcome this drawback, it will
    remain resident in memory, and AUTOMATICALLY scan all files you
    copy, download, modify, or unarchive!

    Probably you think that a resident virus scanner consumes much
    memory, makes your system slow, and is a source of many problems.
    But, if you already know our free-ware scanner TBSCAN, you know that
    this scanner can scan your files ten times faster compared with other
    scanners. Also TBSCANX achieves this lightning fast speed. Actually,
    TBSCANX is a lot faster, since it will not access your disk to scan
    the files, because all files to be created or modified reside
    already in memory!

    Besides this, TBSCANX consumes only 5Kb of memory, including the
    signatures to scan for!

    TBSCANX carries the same feature of its transient brother TBSCAN:

    +   TBSCANX is fully programmable by means of a data file.

        Most of the time viruses spread quickly. After a new virus has
        been found there is often no time to adapt your virus checker in
        order to make it capable of recognizing this new virus. That is
        why TBSCANX uses a data file in which the signatures of the
        viruses occur. This file can quickly be adapted, possibly by
        yourself, for example when you are informed of a new virus
        through the media. TBSCANX supports among other things the format
        which is used in the file "virscan.dat". This file is regularly
        adapted and can be obtained at a lot of data banks.


    +   TBSCANX supports wildcards in the signature.

        A lot of viruses encrypt themselves after each infection, so the
        signatures always look different. There is one part of the virus
        however that cannot be modified: the routine that has to
        "unpack" the modified part of the virus.

        But it is a misunderstanding that this part of the virus always
        should look the same. The fact is there are viruses that pepper
        their unpack-routine with useless instructions which have no
        effect and which are continuously replaced by other nonsensical
        instructions. Although the unpack-routine always functions the
        same, it looks different every time because of these changing
        fake instructions!

        By inserting wildcards on places where the fake instructions
        occur in the signatures of the data file, such a virus can still
        be traced and identified. This is the case because any character
        may be used on the place of a wildcard.

        It is also possible to skip a variable amount of garbage bytes
        in the signature.


    +   TBSCANX supports normal text as the signature.

        Most signatures are inserted in ASCII-HEX. But when desired you
        can also specify a normal text as the signature. In this case
        you put the text between double quotation marks.



USAGE OF THE PROGRAM
--------------------

    TBSCANX is easy to use. Simply type TBSCANX.

    TBSCANX looks for the data file in the way mentioned hereunder:
    1)  It searches in the active directory for a file with the
        name TBSCAN.DAT.
    2)  It searches for TBSCAN.DAT in the same directory as the
        program file TBSCAN.COM itself is located.
    3)  It searches in the active directory for a file with the
        name VIRSCAN.DAT.


    Whenever a program tries to write to an executable file (files with
    the extensions .COM and .EXE), you will shortly see the text
    "Scanning..." in the upper left corner of your screen. As long as
    TBSCANX is scanning this text will appear. Since TBSCANX takes not
    much time to scan the file, the message will only appear shortly.

    When TBSCANX has found a virus, it will display the the message
        WARNING, <filename> is infected with <virus name>!
        Abort? (Y/n)

    Press "N" to continue, press any other key to abort.

    To display the name of the virus, TBSCANX needs the signature file.
    It will use the signature file that was used when you invoked the
    program. If the signature file is missing (because you deleted it,
    or because you removed the floppy with it), or no file handles are
    left, TBSCANX will still detect viruses, but it is no longer able to
    display the name of the virus. It will display [Name unknown]
    instead.

    The unregistered version of TBSCANX will abort scanning after 10
    minutes, except if you have a Thunderbyte add-on card installed.
    To register TBSCANX, see the register.doc file.

FORMAT OF THE DATA FILE
-----------------------

    The data file (called TBSCAN.DAT or VIRSCAN.DAT) can be read
    and/or modified with every ASCII editor.

    All lines beginning with ";" are comment lines. TBSCANX ignores
    these lines completely. When the ";" character is followed by a
    percent-sign the remaining part of the line will be displayed on the
    screen. A maximum of 15 lines can be printed on the screen. Nice for
    "HOT NEWS"...

    In the first line the name of a virus is expected. The second
    line contains one or more of the next words:
            BOOT  SYS  EXE  COM  HIGH  LOW

    These words may be separated by spaces, tabs or commas.

    TBSCANX will only scan for viruses with the keywords COM or EXE. The
    other keywords will be ignored, and are only used by the
    non-resident version: TBSCAN.

    BOOT means that the virus is a bootsector virus. SYS, EXE and
    COM indicate the virus can occur in files with these
    extensions. Also overlay files (with the extension OV?) will be
    searched for EXE viruses. HIGH shows that the virus can occur in the
    memory of your PC, namely in the memory located above the TBSCAN
    program itself. LOW means that the virus can occur in the memory of
    your PC, namely in the memory located under the TBSCAN program
    itself.

    In the third line the signature is expected in ASCII-HEX.
    Every virus character is described by means of two characters.
    Instead of two HEX characters, two question marks (the wild-
    card) may also occur. The latter means that every byte on
    that position matches the signature. Below you will find an
    example of a signature:
            A5E623CB??CD21??83FF3E

    You can also use the asterisk followed by an ASCII-HEX character to
    skip a variable amount of bytes in the signature. The ASCII-HEX
    character specifies the amount of bytes that should be
    skipped. The signature could be:
            A5E623CB*3CD2155??83FF3E
    The next sequence of bytes will be recognised as a virus:
            A5E623CB142434CD21554583FF3E


    Instead of a signature in ASCII-HEX you can also specify a
    normal text. This should be put between double quotation
    marks. A correct signature is for example:
            "I have got you!"

    This series of three lines should be repeated for every virus.
    Between all lines comment lines may occur.

THUNDERBYTE
-----------

    Virus scanners have a number of very serious disadvantages!

    +   They cannot prevent infection.
        Virus scanners can only tell you whether or not your
        system has been infected and if so, whether any damage
        has already been done. By then only a good (non-infected)
        backup can still save you.

    +   They can only recognize viruses that have already been
        identified. When a new virus has been launched it will
        take a while before someone discovers it. After that it
        will take some time before a reliable signature is dis-
        tilled from the virus and it will also take a while for
        you to get hold of the newest virscan.dat.
        All this means that there is a real chance that your
        system is infected at a moment virus scanners have not
        yet recognized "your" virus!

    +   You will have to do an active operation in order to pro-
        tect your system: namely executing the virus scanner.
        Even with TBSCAN this takes time and so it is unpleasant.
        Certainly when a PC is used by more than one person, like
        for instance in companies, things go wrong quite often.

    Viruses get more and more advanced. Among other things because
    of all the attention the media is paying to the phenomenon
    computer virus. It has even become a real sport for sick minds
    to write computer viruses. Even viruses that have no stable
    signature anymore have already been discovered. Because TBSCAN
    allows wildcards in the data file it can still trace this kind
    of viruses quite often. But it will not take much time anymore
    before viruses will be created that have no special charac-
    teristics at all by which they can be identified. And then
    even TBSCAN cannot help you anymore. Even viruses that look
    for the DOS entry point in the same way as TBSCAN does, avoi-
    ding detection by protection programs in an effective way,
    already exist.

    To provide programs with a checksum is neither a solution: as
    soon as a file is read in, viruses can disinfect it, so every
    infected program looks like one that is not.

    There is however ONE solution for the abovementioned problems:
                         *** ThunderByte! ***

    ThunderByte was developed to protect Personal Computers
    against computer viruses, Trojan Horses and other threats to
    valuable data. It is a hardware protection, consisting of an
    adapter card, an installation and configuration program and a
    clear manual. The working of ThunderByte is not based on
    knowledge of specific viruses, so ThunderByte also protects
    against future viruses.

    A hardware protection offers much more protection than a soft-
    ware protection. ThunderByte is already active before the
    operating system is loaded, so the computer will be totally
    protected right after the starting of the PC.

    Because of the many configuration possibilities and the intel-
    ligent algorisms, the use of ThunderByte will never become a
    burden: you will hardly notice the presence of ThunderByte in
    an environment without any viruses.


    Advantages of a hardware protection:

    +   The protection uses very little (1Kb) RAM

    +   The protection is already active before the first boot attempt
        of the PC, and therefore protects also against bootsector
        viruses. A software protection can not protect you against
        bootsector viruses, since it has not been executed at boot time.

    +   De hard disks can not be accessed directly anymore, because
        ThunderByte is connected to the hard disk cable.

    +   It is impossible to forget to start ThunderByte, even if the
        machine is booting with a diskette.



    ThunderByte offers you many kinds of protection:


    +   Protection against loss of data.

        ThunderByte is connected between the cable of the hard
        disk and the controller. It prevents the hard disk from
        being accessed directly. The only way to access the drive
        from now on is by initiating an int 13h.

        In addition ThunderByte detects all direct disk writes
        which try to achieve a modification or damage of the data
        and it checks which program orders the execution of such
        operations. Only the operating system can preform these
        operations unmentioned.

        Standard DOS already has the possibility of protecting
        files against overwriting and modification by means of
        the read only attribute. However this protection can be
        very easily eliminated by software. But ThunderByte pre-
        vents this protection from being ruled out without this
        being noticed, so now it is nevertheless possible to
        protect your files effectively with a standard method.


    +   Protection against infection.

        ThunderByte protects programs (files with the extension
        EXE, COM or SYS) against infection by judging all modifi-
        cations on their intention. The functionality is not
        influenced by this. Compiling, linking, etc., are not
        disturbed and neither are programs that save their confi-
        guration internally. Furthermore software can be protec-
        ted with the help of the aforementioned read only attribute.

        Attempts to modify the bootsector of the disk are
        detected, so the dreaded bootsector viruses are also
        eliminated. Keep in mind that the bootsector can hardly
        be protected by software. Only ThunderByte already beco-
        mes active before the system tries to boot!


    +   Detection of viruses.

        In addition to the abovementioned ways of detecting the
        presence of viruses, ThunderByte can also do so because
        viruses carry out a number of special operations. For
        example, the marking of already infected programs in
        order to recognize them, is detected by ThunderByte. So
        are the attempts of viruses to reside in the memory in a
        suspicious way and the abnormal manipulations with
        interrupt vectors.


    +   Password protection.

        ThunderByte has the possibility of installing a password.
        There are two kinds of passwords: one that is always
        asked for or one that you only have to enter when
        attempts are made to start from a diskette instead of the
        hard disk.

    +   Safety.

        A lot of attention has been paid to the safety of ThunderByte
        The program code of ThunderByte is located in ROM and there is
        no way it can be modified.

        There is not one method of eliminating ThunderByte
        through software. All the important settings are realized
        with the help of dipswitches on the adapter card. And
        despite all their wasted intelligence, viruses will never
        be able to turn switches or to influence their read outs.

        Viruses that approach the controller of the hard disk
        directly will have a rude awakening: ThunderByte will
        only pass disk writes when the write or format command
        has followed the normal (checked) course.

        There are a lot of different versions of ThunderByte
        (functioning identically however) that are supplied on
        the basis of capriciousness. That is why knowledge of the
        internal working of only one ThunderByte system is not
        sufficient to damage or destroy its protective working.

        ThunderByte is constantly checking upon its own variables
        with a kind of control number that is different for each
        version. The positions of the memory where the variables
        are kept are also different for each version.


    +   Extra possibilities.

        ThunderByte offers you some interesting bonuses, like
        booting from drive B:, formatting of 5,25" diskettes up
        to 428 Kb on a normal XT.



CONCLUSION
----------

    Are you surprised about the relative great effect and
    inventiveness of such a small (3 Kb) virusscan program? Get
    ThunderByte and keep on amazing yourself!
