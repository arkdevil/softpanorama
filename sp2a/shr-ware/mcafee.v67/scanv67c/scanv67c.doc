Executable Program (SCAN.EXE):
     SCAN contains a self test at load time.  If SCAN has been
modified in any way, a warning will be displayed.  The program will
still continue to check for viruses, however.  In addition,
versions 46 and above are packaged with a VALIDATE program that
will authenticate the integrity of SCAN.EXE.  Refer to the
VALIDATE.DOC instructions for the use of the validation program.
     The validation results for V67-C should be:
                   SIZE: 66,605
                   DATE: 10-15-1990
    FILE AUTHENTICATION:
        Check Method 1 - B87A
        Check Method 2 - 1226

     You may also call the McAfee Associates bulletin board at 408
988 4004 to obtain on-line SCAN.EXE verification data.  The
VALIDATE program distributed with SCAN may be used to authenticate
all future versions of SCAN.

Notes on Version 67-C:
	Sorry about this third release of V67.  67B had problems
scanning floppy diskettes that were write-protected, bootable
system diskettes.  67-C fixes it.

Notes on Version 67-B:
	Version 67-B fixes a minor bug that caused VSHIELD.EXE to
incorrectly CRC check the boot sector and partition table.

Notes on Version 67:
	Our apologies for the delay in releasing V67.  At the last
minute a major new virus -- the Invader -- was reported at multiple
sites across the U.S. and in Asia.  We have included a detector and
remover for this virus in V67 SCAN and CLEAN.  
	Version 67 has added a report feature to allow the creation
of a report file containing a list of found infected files when
scanning an infected system.  We have also implemented an EXTINCT
switch that defaults to not searching for viruses that have become
extinct or viruses that are exclusively research viruses.  Any
virus that has not been reported in the public domain for more than
a year has been classified as extinct.  Extinct viruses are marked
with an asterisk in the VIRLIST.TXT file that accompanies the SCAN
program.  If you are a researcher and have any of the extinct
viruses, you must use the /X switch to force SCAN to search for
them.  In addition, 10 new viruses have been added to the list of
viruses that are identified by SCAN.  These viruses are outlined
in the VIRLIST.TXT file.

Introduction:

     VIRUSCAN scans diskettes or entire systems and identifies any
pre-existing PC virus infection.  It will indicate the specific
files or system areas that are infected and will identify the virus
strain which has caused the infection.  Removal can then be done
automatically using the SCAN /D option.  If the infection is
widespread, automatic disinfector utilities are available which
can remove the infected segment of files and repair and restore the
infected programs.
     SCAN version 5.1V67 can identify all 144 known virus strains
and 223 virus sub-strains (varieties).  The 223 viruses include
the ten most common viruses which account for over 95% of all
reported PC infections.  The complete list (in order of most recent
appearance) can be found in the accompanying file: VIRLIST.TXT. 
The VIRLIST.TXT file lists and describes the 111 major strains and
includes the number of known variants of each strain in
parentheses.
     All known viruses infect one of the following areas:  The hard
disk partition table; the DOS boot sector of hard disks or
floppies; or one or more executable files within the system.  The
executable files may be operating system programs, system device
drivers, .COM files, .EXE files, overlay files or any other file
which can be loaded into memory and executed.  VIRUSCAN identifies
every area or file that has become infected and indicates the name
of the virus that has infected each file.  VIRUSCAN can check the
entire system, an individual diskette, a sub-directory or an
individual file for an existing virus.

*****************************************************************
NOTE:   If you are a virus researcher and have access to extinct 
        or research-only viruses, you should use the /X switch in
        SCAN to force searching for research and extinct viruses.
*****************************************************************

Operation:

IMPORTANT: Always place VIRUSCAN on a write protected floppy prior
to using it.  This will prevent the program from becoming infected.

     To run VIRUSCAN type:

 SCAN d1: ... d10: /NLZ /M /D /A /E .xxx  /NOMEM /MANY /AV /RV /CV
                   /X /REPORT <filename>

              (d1-d10 indicate multiple drives that may be scanned)

                 Options are:
                  /NLZ - Do not scan inside compressed LZEXE files
                    /D - Overwrite and Delete infected files
                    /M - Scan memory for all viruses  
                         (See restrictions below)
                    /A - Scan all files 
          /E .xxx .yyy - Scan listed overlay extensions 
                /NOMEM - Skip memory scan
                 /MANY - Scan multiple floppies
                   /AV - Add validation codes to specified files
                   /RV - Remove validation codes from files
                   /CV - Check validation codes
                    /X - Search for extinct viruses
      /REPORT filename - Send report to named file
 
     VIRUSCAN will check each area or file on the designated drive
that could be a host to a virus.  If a virus is found, the name of
the infected file or system area will be displayed, along with the
name of the identified virus.  
	VIRUSCAN will perform both an internal and an external scan
on programs that are compressed with LZEXE.  The compressed file
will first be scanned externally and then it will be automatically
de-compressed and scanned again for an internal infection.  The
/NLZ option will disable the decompression and internal scan
function.
     If the /D option is selected, SCAN will pause after each
infected file is displayed and will ask whether you wish to remove
the infected file.  If <Y> is selected, the file will be
overwritten with the hex code C3 (the Return instruction), and then
deleted.  This option is disallowed for boot sector and partition
table infections.  Use the shareware M-DISK utilities to remove
boot sector or partition table viruses.
     If the /M option is chosen, SCAN will search the first 640K
of memory for all known memory resident viruses.  Selecting this
option may cause false alarms if you are running SCAN in
conjunction with any other virus detection utility.  It will also
add from 12 seconds to 1 minute to the scanning time.  If the /M
option is not chosen, SCAN will in any case check memory for the
Dark Avenger virus.  If the Dark Avenger is found in memory, SCAN
will display a warning message, with instructions to power down and
re-boot from a clean floppy.

     >>> Do not use the /M option if you are running SCANRES V42
         or earlier.  Please upgrade SCANRES to the current version
         first.  Otherwise false alarms will result.

     Use the /E option to scan specified overlay files.  Scan will
default to OVL, OVG, OV1, OV2, OVR, SYS, BIN and PIF.  Scan will
search these overlay files for any viruses capable of infecting
overlays.  If you are using an application with overlay extensions
other than the defaults, then specify the extension names (up to
three) using the /E option.  Example:

          SCAN C: /E .ABC .XYZ .123

     It is important to note that viruses that infect overlays
always infect the original .COM, .EXE, .BIN or .SYS files that call
the overlay.  So the virus will always be discovered whether or not
the overlay is scanned.  To get rid of the virus, however, you must
identify and remove it from overlays.  If you do not know whether
an application uses overlay files, and SCAN has discovered one of
the viruses capable of infecting overlays, then use the /A option
to search all files.  
          NOTE:  The /A option will require a substantial amount
          of time to complete the scan.  Use it only after a .COM
          or .EXE infection has been discovered by VIRUSCAN, or
          when a new diskette or set of program files is to be
          scanned.


VALIDATION CHECKING for UNKNOWN VIRUSES:

	Version 66 and above allow the user to add validation codes
to specified files or areas of the system.  All COM and EXE files,
as well as the boot sector and partition table can be validated. 
The validation process adds 10 bytes to each validated file.  To
validate the entire disk type:

                          SCAN d: /AV

	This command will cause SCAN to add the validation codes to
all COM and EXE files.  SCAN will also create a hidden file in the
root of the designated drive that contains validation information
for the partition table, the boot sector, and COMMAND.COM.  The
command:

                   SCAN d:\TEMP\NEWFILE.EXE /AV

	will cause SCAN to add a validation code to the file
NEWFILE.EXE.  

Note:  SCAN will not create the file containing codes for the boot
sector and partition table unless the entire disk is selected for
validation.

     To remove the validation codes from validated files, use the
/RV option.  To cause SCAN to check the validation codes, use the
/CV option.  the /AV, /RV, and /CV options may be used in
conjunction with any other SCAN options.
			
     VIRUSCAN will require approximately 3 minutes of run time for
each 1,000 files on the designated drive.  If the /CV option is
selected, the run time will increase by 25%.
                    
WARNING:  Some systems, notably older Zenith PCs and some Hewlett
Packard models, use a non-standard boot sector or partition table
program.  These programs may modify the boot sector or partition
table each time the system is booted.  If you are experiencing a
warning flag from SCAN indicating continual changes in your boot
sector or partition table, refer to your system's owner's guide to
determine whether your system uses such a self-modifying boot
program.

Exit Codes:

     SCAN will exit with the following exit codes:

               0 - Normal termination, no viruses found
               1 - One or more viruses found
               2 - Abnormal termination (Error)

corporate environment using local area networks you will need to
run NETSCAN.  NETSCAN is not a shareware product.  Site licenses
are available for NETSCAN through McAfee Associates - 408 988 3832.

Virus Removal:

     What do you do if a virus is found?  Well, if you are a
registered VIRUSCAN user, you may contact McAfee Associates for
free assistance in manually removing the virus or for information
on disinfection utilities.  Automatic disinfectors are available
for the majority of the known viruses and are available from McAfee
Associates.  We strongly recommend that you get experienced help
in dealing with many of the viruses, particularly partition table
and boot sector infections.  If you are not a registered user, the
following steps should be followed:

     Boot sector infections:
     Power down the system.  Power up and boot from an uninfected,
     write protected floppy.  Execute the DOS SYS command to
     attempt an overwrite of the boot sector.  This works in many
     cases.  If this does not work, backup all data files and
     perform a low level format of the disk.

     Executable file infections:
     Power down system.  Boot from clean, write protected floppy. 
     Remove all infected files.  Replace from the original
     distribution diskettes.

     Partition table infections:
     Without a removal utility, the only option is to low level
     format the media.

     Disinfecting utilities are available from McAfee Associates
     for the majority of the common viruses.  These utilities
     remove the virus and repair the infected files.  If you are
     not a registered user of VIRUSCAN, you may purchase these
     utilities from:

                         Version Notes

Version 66-B:
	Version 66-B fixes a bug in the validation removal processing
of SCAN.  Version 66 would not remove validation codes from
validated files unless the /CV option were set.  Version 66-B fixes
this problem.  It also fixes a bug that caused inconsistent results
when certain files (PKZIP is one example) were validated.  If you
have already used V66 to validate your files, then use 66-B to
remove the validation codes put in place by V66 (using /RV), and
then restore the validation codes using the /AV option.  We regret
any inconvenience this may have caused. 

Version 66:
	We skipped version 65 since a trojan version 65 of SCAN
appeared on a few bulletin boards in March of this year.  Better
safe than sorry.  So this version logically follows version 64 of
SCAN.
	This version of SCAN has added an option to transparently
attach a CRC validation code to all of your executable files, your
boot sector and your partition table.  This will help protect your
system in case a virus unknown to SCAN is encountered.  SCAN will
check these validation codes if requested and will alert the user
to any files or system areas that have changed.  Subsequent
versions of VSHIELD (Version 67 and above) will also check this
validation field if present, and will prevent programs infected
with unknown viruses from executing.
	Version 66 has added 31 new viruses to the list of known
viruses, bringing the current total to 213 viruses.  We have also
added the Joshi, Fish6, Vienna and Zerobug to the list of viruses
that can be non-destructively removed from your system by Clean-
Up.  All four of these viruses are becoming widespread.  
	Of interest in this release are two new viruses that infect
both executable programs and boot sectors.  The 1253 virus, which
activates on December 24th, infects boot sectors of floppies, the
partition table of hard disks and any COM files in the system,
including COMMAND.COM.  The virus originated in Eastern Europe. 
It is very destructive.  The second virus has been named Anthrax,
and is also from Eastern Europe.  This virus infects COM files, EXE
files and the partition table of the hard disk.  Both viruses are
difficult to remove without appropriate detectors and removers. 
	The list of all new viruses added to the SCAN list are
included in the enclosed file - VIRLIST.TXT.  For a detailed
description of each of these viruses, please refer to Patti
Hoffman's VSUM document.  VSUM is copyrighted by Patricia Hoffman.

Version 64:
	Version 64 of SCAN repairs a number of small bugs in version
63, including the inability to catch the Fish-6 virus in memory and
an infrequent false alarm with the Korea virus when running
AppleTalk.  We have also re-designed VSHIELD so that it uses an
overlay structure and now only occupies 2.9K of memory.  A
re-structuring of our scanning technique was also required due to
the appearance of another fully encrypted virus (V2P2).  This virus
has no string that is common for all iterations of the virus, so
that a virus-specific search technique was required.
	In addition, 14 new viruses have surfaced from various parts
of the world.  Of the 14 viruses, two appear to be fairly virulent.
The Joshi virus, from India, is a boot sector and partition table
infector which activates on the 5th of January.  When activated,
it locks up the machine and displays the message "Type Happy
Birthday Joshi".  The system stays locked until the user types the
happy birthday message.  In addition the virus causes problems in
writing to or reading from 1.2Mb diskettes.  The second virus is
from Taiwan and has been named the Taiwan-3 virus.  It infects EXE
and COM files, including COMMAND.COM.  It is memory resident and
randomly appears to garble the File Allocation Table of the hard
drive.  Both viruses have been reported at multiple sites.
	The twelve additional viruses are outlined in the enclosed
VIRLIST.TXT file.  For a detailed description of each, please refer
to Patricia Hoffman's VSUM document.
