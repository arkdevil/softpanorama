Executable Program (CLEAN.EXE):
	CLEAN contains a self test at load time.  If CLEAN has been
modified in any way, a warning will be displayed.  The program will
still continue to repair and clean infected programs, however.  In
addition, versions 55 and above are packaged with a VALIDATE
program that will authenticate the integrity of CLEAN.EXE.  Refer
to the VALIDATE.DOC instructions for the use of the validation
program.
	The validation results for V67 should be:
			    SIZE: 92,065
			    DATE: 10-05-1990
    FILE AUTHENTICATION:
		Check Method 1 - 7F1A
		Check Method 2 - 0D91

	You may also call the McAfee Associates bulletin board at 408
988 4004 to obtain on-line SCAN.EXE verification data.  The
VALIDATE program distributed with CLEAN may be used to authenticate
all future versions of CLEAN.  
	
Notes on Version 67:
	Version 67 is able to remove and repair four new viruses: 
Whale, Invader, Slow, and EDV.

OVERVIEW:

	CLEAN-UP kills and removes computer viruses, and in most
instances it repairs infected files, re-constructs damaged programs
and returns the system to normal operation.  CLEAN-UP works for all
viruses identified by the current version of McAfee Associates'
SCAN.
	CLEAN-UP searches the entire system looking for the virus that
you wish to remove.  When found, the infected file is identified,
the virus is isolated and removed, and for the more common viruses,
the infected file is repaired.  If the file is infected with a less
common virus that cannot be separated from the file, the infected
file is wiped from the disk and deleted from the system.  A warning
message is displayed by CLEAN-UP before erasing any files, and you
have the option of overriding the erase function.  
	The common viruses that CLEAN-UP is able to remove
successfully and repair and restore the damaged programs are:  

Jerusalem B     Alabama      Jerusalem A     Ping Pong  
Jerusalem E     Stoned       Dark Avenger    Pakistani Brain 
Suriv03         Payday       Alameda         1701
1704            Disk Killer  Ping Pong-B     Ashar
Sunday          1260         4096            Yankee Doodle
Vacsina         V800         Joshi           Fish
Vienna          Zerobug      Whale           Invader
Slow            EDV

	These viruses account for the overwhelming majority of
infection occurrences.  All other known viruses will be identified
and isolated by CLEAN-UP and the infected files' area of disk will
be wiped clean and the files will be removed from the system. 

                ******   I M P O R T A N T   ******

	*	Note: EXE viruses cannot be successfully removed
          from all infected .EXE files in 100% of the cases.  A
          few EXE programs will be damaged beyond repair by the
          infection and they will have to be deleted.  In all
          cases, however, the virus in the file will be killed and
          rendered harmless by CLEAN-UP.  Additionally, removing
          the Stoned virus can cause loss of the partition table 
          in systems with non-standard disk controllers or systems
          that use special purpose device drivers for disk access.
          If you are removing the Stoned virus, as a precaution 
          back-up all critical data before running Clean-up.  Loss
          of the partition table will cause -- LOSS OF ALL DATA
          ON THE DISK. 
    

     ******* FOLLOW THE REMOVAL INSTRUCTIONS CLOSELY *******

* POWER DOWN AND RE-BOOT FROM A CLEAN DISKETTE BEFORE BEGINNING *

RUNNING CLEAN-UP:
	Before running CLEAN-UP, verify the suspected virus infection
by running VIRUSCAN (SCAN.EXE) Version 55 or greater.  SCAN will
identify the virus strain and sub-strain and will display the I.D.
to be used as input to the CLEAN-UP program.  CLEAN-UP uses this
I.D. to determine which virus to seek out and remove.  The I.D. for
each virus is displayed inside a set of brackets - [ ].  For
example, the I.D. for the Disk Killer virus will be displayed by
SCAN as [Killer].  This identical identifier must be used in the
command line of CLEAN-UP in order to remove the Disk Killer
virus.
		
***  Important:  Before you begin the disinfection process, you
MUST power down the infected computer and then re-boot the computer
from a clean, write-protected system diskette.  This step is very
important.  It will remove the virus from control in memory and
prevent the virus from continuing to infect during the clean-up
process.  After Re-booting from the clean diskette, run SCAN on the
diskette to verify that it is indeed not infected.

	To run CLEAN-UP type:

	CLEAN    d1: d2: ... dn: [virusname] /a /many 

			where:

	   dn: - Drive designators for drives to be cleaned.
              (up to 10 drives may be cleaned with one command)

[virusname] - The virus I.D. (brackets must be included)

         /a - Option to check all files

      /many - Option to allow cleaning multiple floppies


      Examples:
 
     CLEAN   C: D: [Jeru]       will clean Jerusalem from C and D
                                drives

     CLEAN   C:\TEMP [Dav] /a   Will clean Dark avenger from
                                C:\TEMP and will search all file
                                extensions for the virus


	CLEAN-UP will display the name of each infected file as it is
found.  When the virus has been removed from each file, a
"successful" message will be displayed.  


	  NOTE:	If a file has been infected multiple times by a
               virus, clean will display the name of the file and
               the "successful" message for each infection
               occurrence.  Thus, multiple lines will be displayed
               for each file infected more than once.


	After running CLEAN-UP, run SCAN again, this time with the /a
option, to ensure that all remnants of the virus have been removed.
	After cleaning the fixed disk drives, SCAN all floppies and
if any infections are found, remove them with CLEAN-UP.

                         Version Notes

Version 66:
	Version 66 is able to remove and repair four new viruses: 
Joshi, Vienna, Fish6, and Zerobug.  All of these viruses have been
reported at multiple sites.  In addition, 27 new viruses have been
included in the Clean-Up detection and eradication processing.  An
outline of the new viruses in included in the enclosed file -
VIRLIST.TXT.  For a complete description of the viruses, please
refer to Patricia Hoffman's VSUM document.		

Version 64:
	Version 64 of CLEAN repairs a number of small bugs in version
63, including the inability to catch the Fish-6 virus in memory and
an infrequent false alarm with the Korea virus when running
AppleTalk. A re-structuring of CLEAN's scanning technique was also
required due to the appearance of another fully encrypted virus
(V2P2).  This virus has no string that is common for all iterations
of the virus, so that a virus-specific search technique was
required.
	In addition, 14 new viruses have surfaced from various parts
of the world.  Of the 14 viruses, two appear to be fairly virulent.
The Joshi virus, from India, is a boot sector and partition table
infector which activates on the 5th of January.  When activated,
it locks up the machine and displays the message "Type Happy
Birthday Joshi".  The system stays locked until the user types the
happy birthday message.  In addition the virus causes problems in
writing to or reading from 1.2Mb diskettes.  The second virus is
from Taiwan and has been named the Taiwan-3 virus.  It infects EXE
and COM files, including COMMAND.COM.  It is memory resident and
randomly appears to garble the File Allocation Table of the hard
drive.  Both viruses have been reported at multiple sites.
	The twelve additional viruses are outlined in the enclosed
VIRLIST.TXT file.  For a detailed description of each, please refer
to Patricia Hoffman's VSUM document.
	The V800 virus has been added to the list of viruses that can
be removed without deleting the infected programs.

Version 63:
	Version 63 has been one of the most painful versions we have
put together.  There have been 17 new viruses and virus sub-strains
discovered in the 35 days since the release of version 62.  We have
also added a major feature to allow SCAN and CLEAN-UP to check
inside of programs compressed with LZEXE; we've added Yankee Doodle
and Vacsina to the list of recoverable viruses in CleanUp; we've
undertaken an accounting of the numerous sub-strains of each virus;
we've repaired over a dozen loopholes that allowed certain
sub-strains to slip through; and we've added a new program to the
product line called VCOPY that replaces the DOS copy command and
does automatic scanning during a copy function.  
	In addition, we've been struggling with the issue of how to
count viruses in a meaningful way that does not place us in a
seemingly disadvantageous competitive position.  For example:
Numerous anti-virus programs advertise the number of viruses that
they are able to detect, and these numbers range from less than 50
to over 100.  On analysis, these numbers included all of the known
sub-strains of the viruses, and their virus count by our
classification was always substantially less.  We group viruses by
major type, where possible, to make it easier to manage, both from
an identification and removal basis.  But on a sheer numbers
comparison, SCAN appears in a weaker light.  After careful thought,
we decided to stick with our classification scheme, but in the
VIRLIST.TXT we will list the known variants detected in
parentheses.  By the competition's counting scheme, we now identify
167 viruses.  By our count, we identify 97.   
	The 17 new viruses and new sub-strains added for version 63
have come from a variety of sources.  Vesselin Bontchev from
Bulgaria submitted three new variants of the 512, one new variant
of the W-13 virus and two entirely new viruses that have surfaced
in Eastern Europe.  Dave Chess from IBM provided me with three new
viruses collected through the various IBM contacts.  Patricia
Hoffamn provided one new virus and two new variants submitted from
users of the FidoNet network.  The Icelandic virus researcher
Fridrik Skulason provided one new virus.  The remaining four were
submitted directly by Homebase users.  The VIRLIST.TXT document
describes the main operating characteristics of the new viruses. 
To avoid duplication of effort, I am referring users to Patricia
Hoffman's most current VSUM document for a detailed description of
the new viruses.
