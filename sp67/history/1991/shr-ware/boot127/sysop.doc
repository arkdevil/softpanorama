          This file provides  information for bulletin  board sysops on the
          distribution of BOOT.SYS via BBS systems.

          Uploads  of the  shareware/unregistered  version of  BOOT.SYS are
          explicitely  permitted. Obviously the registered  version may not
          be  posted on  a BBS (for  a quick  check  run  "boot /v").  Also
          shareware/unregistered  versions  do not  contain  more  than one
          executable!

          Please  note  that  you  must obtain  written  permission  before
          placing BOOT.SYS  into a  user group  or commercial  library that
          distributes disks/programs for a fee. See the file VENDOR.DOC for
          details. This  restriction  does  not affect  your  permission to
          place BOOT.SYS on  the BBS as long as you  are not charging a fee
          (other than the usual user fees for general use of the board) for
          its distribution.
