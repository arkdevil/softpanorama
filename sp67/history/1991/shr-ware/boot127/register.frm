          Registration

          BOOT.SYS is  not free! You  may try it  out at  no charge for  an
          initial trial period to  determine if it fits your needs.  If you
          want to continue to  use BOOT.SYS after the initial  trial period
          you must register. This method of software  distribution is known
          as Shareware.

          This shareware  copy of BOOT.SYS  was obtained from  JP Software,
          P.O. Box 1470, E. Arlington, MA 02174, on  the 4DOS Utility  Disk
          sold with JP Software's product 4DOS. You can  register your copy
          of BOOT.SYS directly with JP Software using the order form in the
          4DOS ORDER.FRM file (see your 4DOS files or 4DOS shareware disk).

          If you are ordering from JP Software, please do NOT use the forms
          in this file!  Use  them only  if you wish  to register  BOOT.SYS
          directly with the author or with Public software Library.

          Payment of the single-copy  registration fee entitles you  to the
          following benefits:

            * A disk with the current version of BOOT.SYS

            * A printed and bound manual

            * A special utility program that lets you transfer your license
              to any  later shareware  versions  of BOOT.SYS  that you  may
              obtain from any shareware source (getting an upgrade from the
              author requires new registration).

            * Free support (by  electronic mail or  by mail) directly  from
              the author for the first 90 days after payment, consisting of
              answering  questions  and  fixing  any  reproducible  program
              error(s) that interfere(s) with the intended use  of the pro-
              gram as outlined in this documentation. The author may choose
              not to  fix problems  related  to a  special hardware  and/or
              software configuration and will then arrange for  a refund of
              the registration fee,  if the problem  is reported within  90
              days  of  payment. The  author  makes  no  other  warranties,
              expressed or implied, and this warranty  is expressly limited
              to the cost of the registration fee.

            * If you register BOOT.SYS through JP Software,  they will pro-
              vide basic technical support, but may refer particularly com-
              plex or difficult questions to the author under  the terms of
              the agreement outlined above.

            * BOOT.SYS is publicly supported on CompuServe in  the DOS Uti-
              lities section of the IBMSYS forum. A  free CompuServe Intro-
              Pak, which includes  a $15.00 usage  credit, is available  to
              registered  BOOT.SYS  users  who  do  not  yet  subscribe  to
              CompuServe. CompuServe  will open  the door for  a whole  new
              world of information, services, and  interesting people. Com-
              puServe is also  the best place  to obtain technical  support
              for products from Hans Salvisberg (and  many other developers
              and vendors).  The CompuServe  IntroPak (a  $39.95 value)  is
              provided to registered  BOOT.SYS users compliments  of Compu-
              Serve, Inc., and Hans Salvisberg. This offer  is dependent on
              its continued availability from CompuServe, Inc.
              For your information: Current CompuServe rates are $12.50 per
              connect hour plus communications surcharges (e.g., $0.30/hour
              in the U.S.A., $9.50/hour in Switzerland and the United King-
              dom, varying rates in other countries).

          BOOT.SYS must  be registered before  it is  used in a  commercial
          (business, corporate, government, educational, or  other institu-
          tional) environment.

          Site licenses are available; for pricing and terms please contact
          JP Software.

          You have three choices for registering:

            - With JP Software (at $40 plus shipping) using  the order form
              in the  4DOS  ORDER.FRM file  (see your  4DOS  files or  4DOS
              shareware disk). Customers in  the U.S. can order  by calling
              1-800-368-877  (orders only  please!).  For more  details  on
              phone, fax, and  EMail orders from  JP Software see the  4DOS
              ORDER.FRM file.

            - With the author in  Switzerland: All payment must be  done in
              Swiss Francs. The easiest  way to do this is by  credit card.
              You authorize us  to charge your card  for the amount  due in
              SFR and the credit card company will automatically convert to
              your currency  using  the current  exchange  rate. We  cannot
              guarantee a  fixed exchange rate  or a  certain date for  the
              conversion to  take place,  but based on  our experience  the
              exchange rates do not vary quickly.
              Alternatively you may send  us a postal money order  in Swiss
              Francs (your local post office does the currency conversion).

            - With  Public  software  Library  in   the  U.S.A.  (single-PC
              licenses only!):  PsL  is authorized  to sell  pre-registered
              single-PC versions  of BOOT.SYS at  $39 +  $4 s&h. They  take
              credit card  orders on  a toll-free phone  number or  written
              orders accompanied by a check or credit card information.

          Note: All prices are subject to change without notice.
