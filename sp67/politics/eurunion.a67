A. General European Union Questions

  1. WHAT IS THE EUROPEAN UNION OR EU?
  
   `European Union' is the name of the organization for the member countries
   that have decided to co-operate on a number of areas ranging from a single
   market to foreign policy, and from mutual recognition of school diplomas to
   exchange of criminal records. This co-operation is in various forms,
   officially referred to as three `pillars':
   
      The [three] European Communities (supranational)
      
      The Common Foreign and Security Policy (intergovernmental)
      
      The Co-operation in the Fields of Home Affairs and Justice
      (intergovernmental)
      
   All member states but Great-Britain also co-operate in the area of social
   policy, on the basis of the social chapter in the Maastricht Treaty. This
   could be considered a fourth pillar, although it was part of the EEC Treaty
   revisions in the drafts of the Maastricht Treaty.
   
  2. WHEN WAS IT FOUNDED?
  
   The European Union as an umbrella organisation has come into existence only
   in November 1993, after the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty. Its
   constituent organisations were founded long before, though:
   
  1952                   The European Community for Coal and Steel  (ECSC) was
                         established by the  Treaty of Paris.
                         
  1958                   The European Economic Community  (EEC) and the
                         European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) were
                         established by the Treaties of Rome.
                         
  1987                   The  Single European Act  of 1987 provided the
                         implementation provisions for the Single European
                         Market[32], and it codified agreement on majority
                         voting in the Council[33] on a range of questions. It
                         also codified the European Co-ordination in the Sphere
                         of Foreign Policy.
                         
  1993                   The European Union  was established by the  Maastricht
                         Treaty which came into force in November 1993. It
                         created an explicit three-pillar structure with a new
                         Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) replacing
                         the Single Act provisions in this field, and codifying
                         the Co-operation in the field of Home Affairs and
                         Justice. It also reexpanded the scope of the EEC, a.o.
                         to include provisions for an Economic and Monetary
                         Union  with a single European currency from the end of
                         the century onwards, and it re-baptised the EEC to
                         simply European Community (EC). [Retrieve the full
                         text of the Maastricht Treaty][34]
                         
  3. WHAT COUNTRIES ARE MEMBERS OF THE EU?
  
   Original ECSC members (from 1952, EEC and Euratom from 1958) include
   Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. From 1973
   they were joined by Denmark, the Republic of Ireland and the UK. In 1981
   Greece joined, followed by Portugal and Spain in 1986. In 1991 the new
   German Laender (the former GDR) were also incorporated.
   
   Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden have agreed to join the EU from 1995
   onwards, subject to approval by their respective peoples in referenda.
   Austria voted in favour of accession on June 12th. The Finns will vote on
   October 16th, the Swedes on November 13th and the Norwegians on 28th.
   Norwegians have already rejected membership once, in 1972.
   
  4. WHAT ABOUT THE LANGUAGES?
  
   Like most international organisations, the EU has two sorts of languages:
   official languages and working languages. Official languages are used for
   official public documents, especially those with legal value. Working
   languages are the languages used internally.
   
   Since EU legislation is directly applicable in national law, all languages
   with official legal status in one or more of the member states must be
   official EU languages as well. This includes Danish, German, Greek, Spanish,
   French, English, Gaelic (Irish), Italian, Dutch and Portuguese; Finnish,
   Swedish and Norwegian will be added shortly if the countries concerned would
   join the EU.  Luxembourg has recognised Letzebuergesch (formerly considered
   the local dialect) as an official national language since 1983, but this has
   not been reflected in EU use of the language.
   
   Council members have never been able to agree on a limit to the number of
   working languages within the institutions. Only Gaelic is not a working
   language; all other languages are considered equal in every way. It should
   be noted though that, in practice, some languages are more equal than
   others. The Commission has limited much of its internal translations to
   French, English and German; some informal meetings do not have interpreters
   at all and are conducted in English entirely. Nick Bernard[35] says the
   Court of Justice uses French as an internal working language.
   
   EU interpretation services have already noted that the currently expected
   expansion to twelve working languages will already be virtually unworkable;
   an expansion to sixteen or more (with Poland, Czechia, Slovakia and Hungary)
   joining will be technically impossible. It is therefore to be expected, in
   my view, that the number of working languages will be limited to three
   (English, French and German) or five (with Italian and Spanish), if only for
   passive use (languages to translate into). No official position has been
   taken on this matter though.

B. What is the difference between the European Union and...

  1. THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY?
  
   The European Community, formerly known as European Economic Community, is by
   far the most important of the three Communities, who together form the first
   pillar[36] of the European Union. This is the only pillar in which there is
   a significant role for central institutions like the Commission and the
   European Parliament, and in which majority voting predominates.
   
  2. THE COMMON MARKET?
  
   The Common Market was one of the most important objectives of the original
   EEC Treaty. Within 12 years from the date of commencement (January 1st 1958)
   of the Treaty, the Member States were required to have formed a common
   market for products, services, persons and capital within a fully fledged
   customs union. No tariffs or quantitative barriers were to remain.
   
   The Common Market objective was effectively attained two years early, from
   1967 onward. After this initial success, economic crises during the 1970s
   and 1980s induced Member State governments to keep or even reinforce
   numerous other, `qualitative' trade barriers, such as health and safety
   regulations.
   
   Since this was a serious impediment to the development of a real internal
   market, business leaders of all member states (united in the so-called Round
   Table of Industrialists) started to lobby to continue on to a real Single
   European Market, in which `qualitative' trade barriers would be attacked as
   well. Member states finally embraced this goal in the Single European Act of
   1987.  The project was supposed to be completed by January 1st, 1993, but
   some of the new rules haven't yet been implemented, notably in the domain of
   free traffic for persons without border controls.
   
   Personal note: in another respect, the term `Common Market' used to be a
   synecdoche [pars pro toto] term in English/the UK to refer to the EEC. It
   was abandoned only in the early 1990s, thereby reinforcing the disputable
   impression (in my view), predominant among English-speakers, that the
   extension of the European Union to other areas than just free trade is a
   very recent phenomenon and a radical change from the Europe they agreed to
   join in 1973.
   
  3. THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE?
  
   The Council of Europe  is quite a different organisation from the EU. It is
   a purely intergovernmental organisation much more like the United Nations;
   unlike EU legislation, its treaties are not  directly applicable in national
   law, unless ratified by the normal parliamentary procedures of the member
   state concerned. The Council of Europe (Conseil de l'Europe, Europarat)
   should not be confused with the European Council[37] (Conseil européen,
   Europäische Rat), which is an EU institution.
   
   Even through these limited powers, the CoE has achieved some remarkable
   results since its founding in 1949. Apart from stimulating grassroots
   European integration through cultural and educational projects, the CoE is
   probably best known for the European Convention on Personal Freedoms and
   Human Rights and the Associated European Court for Human Rights in
   Strasbourg (not to be confused with the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg).
   CoE members actually allow their nationals to challenge national legislation
   and jurisdiction before this court, which has thus become a sort of
   guarantee for human rights, even for countries which do not have a written
   constitution (like Britain) or a supreme court.
   
   Current CoE members include Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czechia,
   Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy,
   Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal,
   Romania, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey
   and the United Kingdom.
   
  4. THE EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION/EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA?
  
   The European Free Trade Association  or EFTA was founded in 1960 as an
   intergovernmental alternative to the supranational aspirations of the EEC.
   The EFTA was not intended as a customs union: member countries did not have
   common custom tariffs but just abolished custom tariffs between them.
   
   Austria, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, Liechtenstein,
   Norway, Portugal, Sweden and the UK were all members of EFTA once, but many
   of these countries joined or applied for the EC/EU afterwards. If all
   prospective EU members actually join from January 1995, the EFTA will just
   consist of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.
   
   To complicate matters even more, EFTA members have signed a far- reaching
   agreement with the then EEC in 1992, to create a common European Economic
   Area. This confers upon EFTA members that ratify it the four free traffics
   of the EU (of products, services, persons and capital) without
   decision-making power but with guaranteed consulting. Unfortunately for the
   designers of this Treaty, the Swiss rejected the EEA in a referendum. This
   may have been a boost for the attempts to join the EU for other EFTA member
   countries. Iceland and Liechtenstein did approve of the EEA, but all other
   remaining EFTA members seem to have chosen full EU membership instead. For
   both EFTA and the EEA, it remains to be seen what they will actually account
   to, in practice, over the next couple of years.
   
   Note:  as Jozef van Brabant[38] notes, Liechtenstein  got into a
   particularly messy situation when the Swiss rejected the EEA Treaty, that
   Liechtenstein itself had already approved, since Liechtenstein was in a
   customs union with Switzerland. Because of this, Liechtenstein will join the
   EEA only on January 1st., 1995.
   
  5. THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT?
  
   The North American Free Trade Agreement  obviously affects different
   countries than the EU does, but it may be interesting to compare the two on
   other points as well. NAFTA has much more in common with EFTA than with the
   EU: it is a free trade agreement, not a customs union, and most certainly no
   attempt to create anything more substantial in political integration than
   just a free trade area. There are no common political institutions and
   member states' sovereignty is left intact.
   
   Personal note: it remains to be seen if NAFTA will not run into the same
   problems that the EEC has had in the 1970s: a replacement of now forbidden
   quantitative trade barriers and tariffs with non-quantitative ones. To
   counter this, member states will either have to accept each other's
   standards in health, safety, environmental and consumer protection, or
   institute a common body which accounts for common standards. That will mean
   a loss of sovereignty for the individual states however.
   
  6. THE WESTERN EUROPEAN UNION?
  
   The Western European Union was founded in 1954 as a defense alliance between
   the UK, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany and Italy,
   after the European Defense Community Treaty of 1952 was rejected by the
   French Assemblée Nationale in 1954. It was more or less dormant until the
   beginning of the 1990s, when it was revived as a sort of common intermediary
   solution between an organisation of the European NATO members and Defense
   aspirations of the European Union. Spain, Portugal and Greece have joined
   the WEU since, and both Denmark and theRepublic of Ireland (which is not a
   member of NATO) have observer status.

C. Questions about European Union institutions

   Personal note: you will notice that in all EU institutions, there is an
   assymetry between the number of inhabitants of member states and the number
   of representatives they have in the various institutions (eg one
   commissioner for 300.000 Luxemburgers compared to two for 80 mio Germans).
   This is a compromise between the supranational princple of
   one-inhabitant-one-vote and the intergovernmental principle of
   one-government-one-vote, and thus an illustration of the general ambiguity
   between supranational and intergovernmental principles that so characterises
   the European Union.
   
  1. WHAT IS THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION?
  
    a. General information
    
   The European Commission is the body that initiates all EU legislation, and
   that should represent the interest of the Union as a whole, both in the
   political processes within the EU as in negotiations with the outside world.
   Also, it is the first body with a duty to look after correct implementation
   of the treaties and subsequent legislation.
   
   Its members are appointed by the government leaders of the member states.
   Small member states each have one Commissioner, while the larger ones
   (Germany, France, Italy, UK, Spain) each have two. That makes a total of 17
   Commissioners now. The new Member States would each get one Commissioner.
   
   Generally, every Commission is more or less balanced in party affiliation
   (Britain always appoints a Tory and a Labour candidate, the Benelux
   countries always see to it that one of their Commissioners is a socialist,
   one a christian-democrat and one a `liberal' [which is more rightwing than a
   christian-democrat in the Benelux].)
   
   Since the Maastricht Treaty,[39] the European Parliament must approve both
   of the President of the Commission and of the Commission in full. It can
   also make the Commission resign with a 2/3 majority. It cannot sack
   individual Commissioners. The EP is the only institution with this power;
   the Commission is not accountable to national governments or parliaments.
   
    b. The Directorates-General of the Commission
    
   David Lauder[40] provided the following list of Directorates-General within
   the European Commission:

                         cooperatives
                         
  2. WHAT IS THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT?
  
    a. Composition of the European Parliament
    
   The European Parliament represents the peoples of the member states. It is
   elected once every five years, through direct universe suffrage in every
   member state. The last general EP election was held between 9 and 12 June
   1994. The next will be in June 1999, although there will also be EP
   elections before, in new member states.
   
   There are currently 567 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs):
   
      99 elected in Germany
      
      87 each in France, Italy, the UK
      
      64 in Spain
      
      31 in the Netherlands
      
      25 each in Belgium, Greece, Portugal
      
      16 in Denmark
      
      15 in the Republic of Ireland
      
      6 in Luxembourg
      
   MEPs don't usually vote by country of origin. Instead, they organise in
   political groups according to ideology and/or party affiliation. Note:
   Parties marked with an asterisk are present in more than one EP political
   group
   
  Party of European Socialists (198 seats), leader Ms Pauline Green (UK)
                         
      62 Labour (UK)
      
      40 Socialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (DE)
      
      22 Partido Socialista Obrero Español (ES)
      
      16 Partido democratico della Sinistra (IT)
      
      15 Europe Solidaire (Parti Socialiste) (FR)
      
      10 Partido Socialista (PT)

    b. Rights of the European Parliament
    
   In many procedures, the European Parliament has the right to amend or reject
   Commission proposals before the Council takes the final decision. There are
   two flaws to this power, which make the EP much less powerful than its
   national counterparts:
   
      The Commission can freely reject EP amendments, without any sanction;
      unlike national governments which face a choice between accepting the
      will of parliament or resigning. Therefore, the EP's `Right to Amendment'
      is in fact not much more than a `Right to Advise'. Also, the Commission's
      opinion of EP amendments is crucial to their adoption since the final
      decision in the Council can only depart from the Commission's final
      proposal by unanimous vote.
      
      EP amendments and rejections are valid only if
      
      60% of votes are in favour and
      
      if the MEPs voting in favour constitute at least half of all MEPs.
      
   Especially the latter requirement makes it quite difficult to influence the
   political process, and personally I think that democratically perverse
   situations arise when an amendment is declared rejected even if 90% of votes
   are in favour of it, just because only 50% of MEPs have turned up for the
   vote. It would be better, in my view, to require a high quorum of MEPs
   turning up before a vote can take place; MEP votes are the only example I
   know where a quorum is applied to the result of the vote instead of to the
   vote itself. Please note that this paragraph has aroused considerable
   discussion whether this rule is undemocratic or not. Most people seem to
   disagree with me.
   
  3. WHAT IS THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS?
  
   The Council of Ministers  (or simply Council) represents the member state
   governments. The Council is composed of member state ministers: depending on
   the matter under discussion, either the ones responsible for specific policy
   areas (environment, transport, treasury) or the foreign ministers for
   general affairs.
   
   In principle, the Council decides unanimously on major policy decisions.
   Minor decisions, often filling in the details of general policies that were
   decided upon before by unanimous vote, are often approved of by qualified
   majority . For this purpose, each member states' votes are pondered
   less-than-proportionally to the number of inhabitants:
   
      10 votes each for France, Germany, Italy, the UK
      
      8 votes for Spain
      
      5 votes each for Belgium, Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal
      
      3 votes each for Denmark and the Republic of Ireland
      
      2 votes for Luxembourg
      
      Prospective members Austria and Sweden would each get 4 votes; Finland
      and Norway 3 each.
      
   A qualified majority decision is valid if 54 out of 76 votes are in favour
   of it (in other words: a 70% majority vote is required). In some cases the
   majority in favour must also include at least eight countries.
   
   Note:In April 1994, the UK tried to oppose an extension of the 70% rule to
   the prospective EU of 16 member states, arguing that the blocking minority
   should remain on 23 votes (out of 90) to retain the British veto. This was
   quite a remarkable position, since teh UK has only 10 votes and does thus
   not dispose of a veto in qualified majority decisions.
   
   As Nick Bernard[42] wrote in eunet.politics: "There are in fact two
   different issues: the question of the so-called veto properly speaking,
   which is a reference to the Luxembourg accords of 1966 (and the UK
   understanding thereof) and the issue of the weighting of votes in Qualified
   Majority Voting (QMV)  with enlargement of the EU. In the UK, politicians
   (on all sides) did little to clear this ambiguity. it often sounded as if
   they either did not have a clue as to what they were talking about or did
   have a clue but pretended not to. Nothing new here ( -:))"
   
   Britain's arguments were not accepted, but it was agreed that a blocking
   minority of 23-26 votes would cause a proposal to be reconsidered and
   delayed for some time.
   
  4. WHAT IS THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL?
  
   The European Council  was established in 1974, but its existence was only
   enshrined in the Single European Act of 1987. The European Council is a
   special meeting of the Council of Ministers, in which the representatives of
   the Member States are the political heads of government themselves (11 PMs
   and the President of France). The Foreign Ministers and three members of the
   Commission, including its President, also participate. The European Council
   should not be confused with the Council of Europe,[43] which is a totally
   separate interntional organisation independent of the EU.
   
   The European Council convenes twice a year, in the last month of each member
   state's presidency of the Council.[44] It has all powers of the Council and
   a few more (especially institutional ones). Its meetings and statements are
   often very important in providing political impetus or laying down
   guidelines in areas of prime importance to the EU, but it leaves the
   day-to-day legislative work to the ordinary Council meetings. The European
   Council also has the main responsibility for the Common Foreign and Security
   Policy.
   
   Note (from the booklet by Emile Noël)[45]:Unlike the Council of Ministers,
   the European Council convenes in the absence of experts, senior civil
   servants or other supporting staff (except interpreters): this plays a major
   part in its political effectiveness, but may often cause problems with
   subsequent implementation of its decisions.
   
  5. WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE EU?
  
   The EU has no president; only its institutions have presidents.
   
    a. President of the European Parliament
    
    MEPs elect the President (or chair) of the European Parliament and his/her
   bureau from their midst, with a mandate of 2,5 years. Subsequent EP
   presidents since the first direct elections were:
   
  1979-1982              Ms Simone Veil (LDR, France)
                         
  1982-1984              Mr Piet Dankert (PES, Netherlands)
                         
  1984-1987              Mr Pierre Pflimlin (EPP, France)
                         
  1987-1989              Sir Henry Plumb (Conservative, UK) [Tory MEPs were in
                         the former European Democrats group during Lord
                         Plumb's presidency; they were the last party to leave
                         this group in 1992, when they joined the EPP on a
                         personal basis.]
                         
  1989-1992              Mr Enrique Baron Crespo (PES, Spain)
                         
  1992-1994              Mr Egon Klepsch (PPE, Germany)
                         
  1994-1997              Mr Klaus Hänsch (PES, Germany)
                         
    b. President of the Council of Ministers and the European Council
    
   The Council has a rotating presidency, with each member state being
   president for six months only. These are the presidencies of the latest and
   following years:
   
  1991                   Luxembourg, the Netherlands
                         
  1992                   Portugal, United Kingdom
                         
  1993                   Denmark,Belgium
                         
  1994                   Greece, Germany
                         
  1995                   France, Spain
                         
  1996                   Italy, Republic of Ireland
                         
    c. President (chairman) of the European Commission
    
   The function of President (or chair) of the Commission has undoubtedly
   become much more important in the last ten years. This has much to do with
   the personal style of the man who has held the job for the last ten years,
   the French socialist Jacques Delors, and the extension of the EU's powers
   during his presidency. Mr. Delors predecessors were mainly considered top
   civil servants, but the political profile of the function has become much
   stronger.
   
   These are some Commission presidents:
   
  1977-1980:             Mr Roy Jenkins (PES [now LibDem], UK)
                         
  1981-1984:             Mr Gaston Thorn (LDR, Luxembourg)
                         
  1985-1994:             Mr Jacques Delors (PES, France)
                         
  1995-2000:             Mr Jacques Santer (EPP, Luxembourg)
                         
   The Commission president is chosen in consensus by the European Council[46],
   which has shown to be quite a difficult task to accomplish now that the
   function had become highly politicised. On July 15th., the European Council
   agreed upon the Luxembourg PM, Mr.Jacques Santer, as the new Commission
   president. The EP approved Mr.Santer by a margin of only 22 votes on July
   21st. In the coming months, it will organise hearings modelled on those in
   the US Senate before it will vote on the collective approval of the new
   Commission.
   
  6. WHAT IS THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE?
  
   The European Court of Justice  can be compared to the supreme court of the
   European Union. It has the task of interpreting the Treaties or secondary EU
   legislation when disputes arise. This is a very important task, since final
   compromises reached within the Council are often deliberately fuzzy to reach
   any agreement at all.
   
   The European Court of Justice consists of thirteen judges and six
   attorneys-general, from all member states. Its decisions are applicable
   directly in national law of all member states concerned.
   
   The European Court of Justice, based in Luxembourg, is not to be confused
   with the European Court for Human Rights and Personal Freedoms, based in
   Strasbourg, which is only competent for issues arising from the European
   Convention for Human Rights and Personal Freedoms, and is recognised by all
   member states of the Council of Europe[47] (see above).
   
  7. WHAT IS THE COURT OF AUDITORS?
  
   The Court of Auditors  checks whether the accounts of all EU institutions
   are in accordance with legislation and jurisdiction, and it can comment on
   EU institutions' financial management. It is intended a safeguard against
   the abuse of political power. It has twelve members: one from each member
   state.
   
  8. WHAT IS THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE?
  
   The Economic and Social Committee  consists of representatives of the
   different sectors of economic and social life, notably of industry, trade
   unions, farmers, transporters and other sectors affected directly by the
   EU's economic and social policies. They must be consulted for policies in
   several areas defined in the treaties; they can be consulted by the Council
   or the Commission in other areas as well.
   
   The ESC has 186 members (MESCs):
   
      24 each from Germany, France, Italy and the UK
      
      21 MESCs from Spain
      
      12 each from Belgium, Greece, the Netherlands and Portugal
      
      9 each from Denmark and the Republic of Ireland
      
      6 from Luxembourg
      
  9. WHAT IS THE COMMITTEE OF REGIONS?
  
   The Committee of Regions  is a new advisory body established by the
   Maastricht Treaty,[48] to take into account the views of regional and local
   government in European decision making. The advisory Committee of Regions is
   a compromise between the aspirations of regions in federally organised
   member states (such as Germany, Spain and Belgium), which have long asked
   for direct influence on EU decision making, and the views of much more
   centralised member states (such as the UK, Denmark and the Netherlands)
   whose regional governments have only derived powers from a strong central
   government.
   
   The CoR has the same numeric composition as the ESC: totalling 186 members
   (MCoRs). It is important to note that the MCoRs are appointed by their
   national governments, not directly by any regional authority.
   
  10. WHAT IS THE EUROPEAN MONETARY INSTITUTE?
  
   The Maastricht Treaty[49] inlcudes provisions for the establishment of a
   Economic and Monetary Union by the end of this century. This was not the
   first try: attempts (to codify the objective) failed in 1962, 1970 and 1978.
   
   The European Monetary Institute  (based in Frankfurt) has the task of
   co-ordinating monetary policy of the central banks of the member states
   within the European System of Central Banks  (ESCB), and to prepare the
   so-called third stage of Economic and Monetary Union, in which a single
   European currency will be introduced. This stage is intended to start in
   1999. At the start of the third stage, the EMI will be renamed to European
   Central Bank (ECB). The director of the EMI is Mr. Alexandre Lamfalussy
   (Belgium).

D. Where to find EU-related information

   New Internet users read this please: All information sources on the Internet
   are represented in Uniform Resource Locator (URL) format throughout this
   document. Although this may look incomprehensible to you at first, it is a
   very convenient standard way to describe almost anything you can get from
   the Internet in any possible way. If you have access to a WorldWideWeb
   client such as Mosaic, MacWeb, WinWeb or Lynx, you may enter the URL
   directly (use the `Load URL' command), or simply use a link if you are
   browsing through this document in your WorldWideWeb client.
   
   If you don't have access to the WorldWideWeb, you may still retrieve the
   URLs through electronic mail. To do this, send a message to
   <listserv@info.cern.ch> with the command `send "<URL>" ' (without the single
   quotes or <> characters, but with the double quotes) in the body. This works
   for all URLs under 5000 lines, though you may encounter problems with binary
   files. Using this service, you may follow the hyperlinks listed at the end
   of this document's text version as if you had a real WWW client. [You may
   have to try several times though, even if the server says it cannot retrieve
   the requested URL].
   
   Intermediate users: If you know how to use gopher and/or anonymous FTP, you
   may retrieve the URLs starting with "gopher://" resp. "ftp://" or "file://"
   at the host mentioned directly behind the "://" characters. Thus
   "ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/documents/text.txt" means anonymous ftp to host
   info.cern.ch, chdir to /pub/documents, file text.txt.
   
  1. EU INFOSYSTEMS ON THE INTERNET
  
   Like most other European governmental institutions, EU institutions are only
   just beginning to connect themselves to the Internet. This seems due at
   least partly to a historical preference for ISO networking protocols (such
   as X.25, X.400) over IP protocols.ECHO
   
   The European Commission's Directorate-General XIII[50] has set up an
   experimental WorldWideWeb server, I'M Europe[51] as of September 1994. It
   contains information related to the Information Market, especially the
   Commission's IMPACT programme, as well as a copy of the Maastricht Treaty on
   European Union.[52]
   
   DG-XIII also offer a telnet connection to their ECHO (European Commission
   Host Organisation) system. This infosystem contains some free databases,
   mostly related to research and development activities within the European
   Union. You will find virtually no information about the EU itself though.
   Some of ECHO's databases require subscription fees, but you can get a free
   access code for all public information. Information: ECHO help desk, tel.
   +352.3498.1200; fax +352.3498.1234.
   
   Try `telnet echo.lu[53]' and login as `echo' if you want to try yourself.
   Alternatively, you may try the unofficial ECHO/WWW gateway[54] which offers
   access to some of ECHO's information without getting into a telnet session,
   such as Eurodicautom[55] (a glossary of mainly technical terms in all EU
   languages).
   
   No other EU institution offers any service on the Internet for now.
   
  2. EU INFOSYSTEMS ON OTHER NETWORKS
  
   There are several other databases available for people logging in through
   the public access X.25 network, Videotex systems or through a simple PSTN
   connection (modem connection via the Public Service Telephone Network;
   obviouslylong-distance charges for most users). Every host has its own
   command language or structure; there is no universal interface.
   
   Most of these systems are not for free, and require previous registration.
   We will thus limit ourselves to very basic information about them.
   
    a. European Commission infosystems
    
      In addition to the Internet connection, ECHO is also available via X.25,
      PSTN and (very limited) national videotex services. See above for
      telephone and fax numbers.
      
      Eurobases is available via X.25 and PSTN. It contains several interesting
      databases, among which the CELEX database with EU legislation and
      jurisdiction. Most information is available in any of the nine EU
      languages. There is a per-kB-fee in addition to the ECU100 administration
      charges. Information: tel.+352.49928.2563, fax +352.407877.
      
      ARCADE is DG-XII[56]'s free two-way, interactive infosystem with specific
      information about the European Commission's R&D programmes. It is
      available in nine languages, via X.25, PSTN and national videotex
      services. Information: tel.+32.2.2950745, fax +32.2.2960626.
      
    b. European Parliament infosystems
    
      The European Parliament offers news and general press information in its
      menu-based EPISTEL system, available via X.25 and PSTN. Subscription is
      free for accredited journalists; others pay ECU 100/month. Information:
      tel.+32.2.2842128, fax +32.2.2305808.
      
      EPOQUE is a documentary database produced by the European Parliament. Its
      first objective is to make information easily accessible internally, but
      it is also intended to provide information on the EP activities to the
      outside world. Access is free, but requires previous registration; EPOQUE
      is available through PSTN in Luxembourg and through X.25. Information:
      fax +352.439317.
      
  3. EU INSTITUTIONS' EMAIL ADDRESSES
  
    a. European Commission email addresses
    
   Most people working at the European Commission should now be reachable
   though the Internet at the address <given_name_initial.surname@mhsg.cec.be>.
   For example: <J.Delors@mhsg.cec.be> [this is most probably a fictional
   address!]. Some of the DG's have their own Internet domain as well, but
   their users should still be reachable under the scheme described above.
   Thanks to Alan Fraser Reekie[57] for providing this information.
   
    b. European Parliament email addresses
    
   The European Parliament has a simple MX (mail exchange) record for
   (old-fashioned?) UUCP connections: ditbxl.eppe.be. Mail sent to
   <postmaster@eppe.be> or <root@ditbxl.eppe.be> usually arrives, but in my
   experience, nobody answers.
   
  4. OTHER EUROPEAN POLITICAL RESOURCES ON THE INTERNET
  
    a. Western European Union information
    
   Several documents[58] from the Western European Union[59]'s parliamentary
   assembly are available.
   
    b. "NO" Campaigns in Nordic countries
    
   Both the Norwegian and the Finnish "NO" campaigns (against accession to the
   European Union, for the October resp. November referenda) have their own
   World Wide Web pages. The Norwegian "NO" page[60] is in the national
   language only (I can't tell whether it is Nynorsk or Bokmål, sorry), while
   the Finnish one is available in Finnish[61] and Swedish.[62]
   
    c. European Union Documents
    
   Apart from the Maastricht Treaty[63] mentioned above, basic EU treaties are
   not available. This is especially regretful since the Maastricht Treaty
   refers to them constantly. Just the EEC and Euratom Treaties[64] are
   available, but only for those with an understanding of Norwegian! The same
   site offers an hypertext version of the Maastricht Treaty in Norwegian[65]
   too. If the same resources are available in other (potential) EU languages,
   please let me know.
   
   There is some electronic documentation from DGXIII[66] available via the
   Universität Stuttgart: ftp://ftp.uni-stuttgart.de/pub/org/cec/
   
   The Bangemann Report[67] (or European Council report on specific measures to
   be taken by the European Community and the Members States for information
   infrastructures) is available on the WorldWideWeb.
   
    d. Discussions on European integration and related topics
    
   Discussion about European Union politics takes place on  Netnews , in
   eunet.politics[68] and alt.politics.ec[69]; sometimes also in
   alt.politics.europe.misc[70]. Neither of these groups are carried by all
   sites, since none of them is in the official Usenet feed. Most regulars in
   the discussions try to post all articles both to eunet.politics and
   alt.politics.ec, so that reading one of the two groups should be sufficient.
   
   There are two mailing lists concerned with European Union issues:
   
      The EU list discusses all issues pertaining to the European Union. To
      subscribe to EU, send a message to <listproc@knidos.cc.metu.edu.tr>[71]
      with the command `SUB EU <your name>' as the first line in the body of
      the mail, not the `Subject:' line. EU is maintained by Egemen Metin TURAN
      <metin@KNIDOS.CC.METU.EDU.TR>[72].
      
      EURO-LEX (All European Legal Information Exchange List) will allow  the
      exchange of and mutual assistance with legal information research in all
      European countries.  Especially invited to participate in EURO-LEX are
      members of law faculties and law library staffs at European universities
      and other academic institutions. Experts in specialized legal fields are
      as welcome as "allrounders" in legal documentation and information. To
      subscribe to Euro-Lex, send a message to <listserv@vm.gmd.de>[73] with
      the command `sub euro-lex <your name>' as the first line in the body of
      the mail, not the `Subject:' line. Euro-Lex is maintained by Renate
      Weidinger) <bbweidin@dnkurz1.bitnet>[74]
      
    e. Miscellaneous resources
    
   Jonathan Slater[75] has created a graphical collection of European
   resources[76] in WebWorld, with references to i.a. a collection of European
   countries' (cultural) home pages,[77] and to the file you are reading now of
   course ;-)
   
   If you can wait a few minutes for retrieval, the Internet can also provide
   you with the current ECU rate[78]:
   gopher://gopher.uni-paderborn.de:4324/echofind info ECU
   
   Finally, there is a WWW page giving access to several sizes of the European
   flag[79] in monochrome and colour graphical files. I think the blue should
   be darker though.
   
  5. REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES AND DELEGATIONS
  
   The first version of this list included telephone and fax numbers of the
   EP's and EC's representative offices and delegations. I have excluded them
   from version 1.1 on, because I think it would be much more useful to have
   complete lists (including postal addresses) posted separately. As soon as I
   have the complete files ready, I will make it another periodical posting
   connected to this file. Up to then , please contact me if you need an
   address.
