		  WIZUNZIP 2.0	

This is the general release of WizUnZip 2.0, a freeware Windows Unzipper.  
WizUnZip is based on the Info-ZIP group's non-profit product,
unzip 5.0p1.  WizUnZip 2.0 can extract, view, and test the new 
PKZIP 2.04 archives containing "deflated" files as well as 
earlier types.

This archive contains the following files:

	README			This file
	WIZUNZIP.EXE		The WizUnZip executable
	WIZUNZIP.HLP		The WizUnZip help file
	WIZUNZIP.WAV		The WizUnZip sound file 

WizUnZip is different from other Windows unzippers in that:
1) It is free! No license fee. No registration fee. No contribution.
2) It can play a sound effect while unzipping if your system has 
   a sound card supported under Windows.
3) It supports drag-and-drop.  (Thanks, Johnny Lee)
4) The `C' language source is available.

Install WizUnZip by copying WIZUNIP.EXE, WIZUNZIP.HLP, and WIZUNZIP.WAV
into  any directory listed on your PATH  environment variable, e.g.
your WINDOWS directory.   WIZUNZIP is then ready to use.

For more information, please view the help file under Windows, by running

	WINHELP WIZUNZIP.HLP 

WizUnZip runs in these environments:
1) Windows 3.1, with and without sound capability.
2) Windows 3.0 Standard and 386 Enhanced modes 
   (when the libraries COMMDLG.DLL and SHELL.DLL are present)
3) Windows NT, March '93 Beta, (FAT file system only).
4) OS/2 2.0 (when the libraries COMMDLG.DLL and SHELL.DLL are present).

If you are running Windows 3.0 or OS/2 2.0 and do not already
have the libraries COMMDLG.DLL and SHELL.DLL, obtain the archive
WUNL20.ZIP, which contains the necessary libraries.

This software has been beta tested by many users worldwide, and 
I think it's ready for general use.
As the enclosed documentation affirms, neither Info-ZIP nor I take
responsibility for any losses due to use of WizUnZip.
