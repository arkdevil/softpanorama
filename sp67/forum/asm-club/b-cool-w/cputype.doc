 Appendix A. Library Features and Notes.
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The Too-Much-In-One-So-Don't-Get-Lost(tm) CPU/FPU feature detection library
 allows you to distinguish between following 80x86 family CPUs:

 Intel 8088,8086,80188,80186,80286,80386DX,80386SX,i486DX,i486SX,Pentium and
 any succeeding CPUs (when they become available),
 NEC V20 and V30,
 Cyrix 486SX/SLC, 486DX/DLC and M1 (586)

 FPUs:

 Intel 8087,80287,80287XL - not 100% reliable,80387,i487sx and 487 internal,
 Cyrix 2C87,3C87 and 4C87,
 IIT 2C87 and 3C87,
 Weitek 1167 and 1367, both reported simply as Weitek;

 determine whether or not the processor is in V86 mode (for DOS programs only)-
 generally this one just tests for PM flag and assumes V86 if it is set for DOS
 + PM combination automatically leads to V86;

 determine 386dx chip step (B0 or earlier,B1,D0 or later) - 
  this one tests for known bugs in chips of these steps, it does not reset CPU
  to look at EAX value; doesn't work under Windows;

 determine CPU clock speed (for all listed processors, was not checked on some
 models and may require some adjustments). Works fine under _my_ Windows, but
 some people stated it produced incorrect results on their systems.

 Note 1:

 AMD Am386SX/40 and Am386DX/40 - can be identified as such by using CPU_Type
 in conjunction with Speed: if CPU is identified as Intel 386 and its clock is
 more than 33MHz then this is definitely an AMD chip - Intel doesn't produce
 40MHz 386s while AMD does. However this method is not implemented in CPU_Type
 routine because speed computing requires some floating point calculations and
 I don't want to insert FPU instructions in the code because there may be no
 FPU... You may implement this method in your high-level routine reporting
 CPU type if you want (and as I did :). Also you may conclude i486DX2 if it is
 identified as 486DX and has CPU clock of 66 MHz - afaik Intel do not produce
 DX chips with such clock frequencies. However I cannot quarantee this is true
 and don't use this method by myself. If anyone knows of reliable method of
 identifying DX2, DX4 and other chips with internal clock doubling then
 please let me know.

 Note 2:

 The source code is commented so I didn't include its description here. I think
 there'll be no problem using it. I also included samples in Turbo Pascal and
 Turbo C, which may be incorporated into your hi-level programs. Lotta probs
 vanished, heh :)

 Note 3:

 This code will incorrectly state Cx486DLC/4C87 to be Cx486DX. I know of no
 way to make it work properly... :( Also, Cx87SLC is identified as 3C87 and
 again no can do...

 Note 4:

 More and more CPUs approaching: DX4, SLC2, SLC3; 486xx series's getting more
 and more xx modifiers without differences to software... I feel like I'm
 gonna give up adding new CPU types here - I got too much problems with those
 I already have. They're all alike, no way to determine which are what. Maybe
 if vendors add special instructions like CPUID in all their chips and
 program microcode to give different results - well, then I'll try. For now
 I'm quit.

 Note 5:

 I have no access to P5 or M1 machines and thus can't check and fix CPU timings
 in CPUSPEED.ASM for these processors. This may lead to inadequate MHz
 reported. If anyone have time and access to a Pentium-based machine I'd like
 you to check this and fix CPUFix values if needed. And don't forget to contact
 me and send me adjusted values so I'll be able to fix them by myself!
 

 Appendix B. Credits.
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 This appendix contains names and netmail addresses of people who contributed
  to this product in any way, either by adding any methods or by fixing
  existing methods given incorrect results. If you do such additions or fixes,
  please contact me and send modified version of the code so that I'll be able
  to incorporate it in next releases.

 My thanx to

 1. Igor Dral of 2:50/321@fidonet
    who helped me lot in cleaning the code of bugs, testing, etc. Thanx, pal!

 2. VAP of 2:5028/52.6@fidonet (he's my BOSS),
    who helped me with C code - I don't like this language myself :)

 3. Alex B. Shamarokov of 2:5020/205.8@fidonet
    who awared me of strange behavior of the code on new Intel' chips with
    CPUID support, so I did an attempt to fix it in v1.14c.

 4. Janis Smits of 2:5100/25@fidonet
    who awared me of OS/2 problems and pointed out the origin of them.

 5. YOUR NAME MIGHT BE HERE...

 And, of course, thanks to Almighty God for the inspiration and everything, 
   and all of you, who paid attention to this product and maybe even made use
   of it!


 Appendix C. Known incompatibilities.
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 1. Under Soft-Ice 2.62 and below incorrectly states 386DX to be 386SX. This
    is because Soft-Ice's V86 monitor do not allow to toggle ANY flags in
    CR0 from V86 task. All other CPU identifiers does just such a mistake
    under Soft-Ice. Let's hope Nu-Mega will fix their monitor in future
    versions of this nice debugger so we'll be able to get correct results. :)

 2. Under Windows 3.1 386 chip stepping determination routine crashes DOS
    session due to "invalid instruction". I didn't find out which one is
    offending yet. This routine was originally taken from PharLap TellMe
    utility. BUT this program just do not perform chip step detection if
    running under Windows Enhanced Mode! Seems like there's no other way to
    correct this problem but do not use this routine under Windows... so I
    finally got rid of it if running under Windows.

 3. I was awared that on certain systems this code completely craches the OS.
    The origin of the problem is not figured out yet, so keep an eye on it and
    if the code causes system crash on your PC, please try to find offending
    source and/or environment that forces it to crash.

 4. Take a look at the batches I provided to simplify compile process and
    correct paths and parameters where needed prior to running them. This is
    especially true for MAKEC.BAT and MLIB.BAT, for they contain paths I used
    on my PC to compile C version of code.
