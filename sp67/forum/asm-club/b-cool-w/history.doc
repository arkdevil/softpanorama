        TMIOSDGL(tm) Version 1.14c Companion Document - HISTORY.DOC
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 History of changes.
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 TMIOSDGL(tm) version 1.10d was the first version publicly released.

 Differences between version 1.10d and version 1.11:

 - changed 80287XL determination logic: now this conclusion is made if CPU
   is 80286 and FPU tests as 80387;
 - added IIT (Integrated Information Technology, Inc.) xC87 math coprocessors
   detection;
 - fixed bug in 386 stepping detection routine.

 Differences between versions 1.11 and 1.11b:

 - fixed bug that caused FPU_Type routine to hang on 486s: they don't handle
   IIT bank switching instructions at all, stopping CPU.

 Differences between versions 1.11b and 1.12:

 - distinguish between Cyrix 486SLC and 486DLC made reliable;
 - code distinguishing between 386sx and 386dx that used bug in dx chips 
    deleted (it was commented out in previous versions) - current method is
    absolutely reliable;
 - code slightly optimized to reduce size.

 Differences between versions 1.12 and 1.12b:

 - some slight modifications made to CPUSPEED.ASM module to prevent invalid
   computation of clock frequency for unknown CPUs.

 Differences between versions 1.12b and 1.13:

 - added 386sl detection routine, but wasn't checked yet: at least it doesn't
   hang the PC :); 
 - distinguishing between i486sx and i486dx finally made reliable;
 - code slightly optimized;
 - CPUSPEED.ASM enhanced and recommented to reflect new CPU type addition.

 Differences between versions 1.13 and 1.14:

 - reduced source file size of CPUSPEED.ASM;
 - Test_Buffer routine made reentrant ( at last! :);
 - added newer 386dx and 486dx recognition ( ID flag of EFLAGS is flippable and
   CPUID instruction works on new 386dx's and 486dx's so I took precaution of
   this situation);
 - described method of identifying AMD's 40MHz 386s and a little bit tricky
   method of identifying i486DX2/66 chips;
 - added method of identifying Cyrix M1 (586) chip - was not checked yet;
 - 386SL detection code commented out, but still present - maybe it works on
   some chipsets...

 Differences between versions 1.14 and 1.14b:

 - added hi-level interfaces and sample programs,
   Turbo Pascal 7.0, Turbo C 2.0 and Borland C++ 3.1 were used to compile these
   examples, they appeared to work o.k.;
 - added i487sx detection;
 - corrected Cyrix chips id's - there are also SX and DX chips;
 - added Known Incompatibilities list;
 - wow! this thingie's gettin' really BIG, ain't it..?

 Differences between versions 1.14b and 1.14c:

 Lots o'bugs fixed in this version:

 - fixed bug in hi-level routines that caused Intel 386/33 chips to be
   identified as AMD ones;
 - finally got rid of DOS session crashes under Windoze in assembly-language
   version on 386dx-based systems; also, the code made Windoze-aware in
   time-critical sections so it won't bother me (and you) anymore;
 - added makeX.bat batches to simplify compile process. Of course paths and
   parameters should be adjusted in 'em;
 - finally fixed code for new 386+ chips which handles CPUID instruction -
   this command appeared to destroy some registers I used to hold temp data.
   Too bad I haven't Pentium data sheet :( - this bug could never appear...
 - added new module P5INFO.ASM and two sample programs in Pascal and C demon-
   strating it's usage - Pentium (and predecessors with cpuid enabled) feature
   info lister. This is rough approach - when I have a P5 data sheet I'll add
   more info;
 - fixed OS/2 DOS Session crash problem on 486 systems - that ugly OS doesn't
   allow to flip NE bit of CR0 hanging up the PC;
 - this thing became really BIG now - 36K in ZIP. I think it's time to stop.
   But I'll still develop it if you, users, will tell me I should.
