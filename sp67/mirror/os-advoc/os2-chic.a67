For anyone thinking about the possibility of coding for

Two nights ago IBM demonstrated Warp2 and the IAK to a captive
Vancouver audience.  This is what an attendee to the MSFT
demonstration of Chicago (er...Windows 95) thought after last nights
demo.  He attended both sessions. This is off the Internet:
<-------------------------- cut here--------------------> 
I must concur.....
Vancouver once again shows that it is one of the most OS/2
centric cities in North America (possibly the world)!  I attended the 
afformentioned OS/2 user group meeting together with 300 others, in an
auditorium that holds 225.  All the Internet addons were shown as well
as allthe OS/2 goodies in the two bonus paks.  However, the most
interesting demo was held the next day............

On Thursday September 8th, the Vancouver PC Users Society held a sneak
preview of the Chicago (Windows 95) product.  It started with three
Microsoft employees (complete with three piece suits that made them
look like IBM employees from yesteryear) showing us the latest goods
from Microsoft.

The first demonstration was with Windows for Workgroups 3.11.  However
halfway into the slideshow of future directions of Microsoft products,
the Video display driver started acting up.  After repeated attempts
to rectify the situation, it was apparent that the demo would have to be
aborted due to a software failure (Microsoft reps blamed it on the AST
notebook computers, but no one in the audience bought it, they all
blamed Windows).

So after announcing that the Windows for Workgroups demo was scrapped,
on he went with the Chicago demo.....

This was even more hilarious, when someone in the audience asked him
what kind of computer he was running.  He stated that both the AST
computers were 486 25 Mhz units with 20 megs of ram (the Warp demo was
shown with a thinkpad running 14 megs)! This brought the house down
with howls of laughter because Chicago was touted as being able to run
in 4 megs of ram!

We saw a number of features that brought murmours of "gee that looks
just like OS/2"!  The tool bar thingy at the edge of the screen is
deceptivly like the OS/2 launch pad, and the right mouse button brings
up a dialog box of settings much like the OS/2 popup menu and settings
pages do, although nowhere near as complete.

We saw a demo of the multithreading when he ran two bezier curve demos
in two seperate threads together with an AVI running in a window.  The
AVI lost all but 16 colours when this was done, possibly to do with a
bug in a pallette manager.  

While this was going on another application was run and the
Bezier curve demos slowed to a crawl (try to imagine the dual bezier
demos as a 28800 BPS download and imagine how many data bits will be
dropped out).

He then went on to show us a DOS window on the screen, but when asked
to do this while the App and the dual Bezier curves and the AVI were
running he stated a curt "NO"! (makes one think that Chicago will not
handle many tasks at the same time).

While he was shutting the AVI demo down the entire Chicago desktop
locked up. He then went on to demonstrate how Chicago could recover
from this failure by bringing up a task list and closing the errant task. 
However what occured was a complete lockup that required a hard reboot.
This brought another round of laughter from the audience (at this time 
I felt a bit sorry for the Microsoft rep that did the demo, after all, he
was
trying to do his best with the product he is being paid to sell).

While the machine was rebooting he took some questions from the
audience. After 5 MINS the Chicago finished rebooting, and he went on
with the demo, this time succeeding in showing us a Windows 4.0 dos
screen.

All the time during the demo people could be heard saying "OS/2 does
that but only different and better".  Soon thereafter the demo concluded,
as I suspect 
that the Chicago beta that they showed (August build) was too flakey
to continue.

To Microsoft's credit, prizes of Windows 3.11 were given out with a
couple of sound cards.    All in all it was not a good night for
Chicago with many in attendance (attendance for this demo was
approximatly 100 people, a far cry from the 300 of the night before to
see the WARP II beta) convinced that OS/2 Warp II was a far better
technology, easier to run, and much much more stable.

When speaking to the reps after the show, they did admit that OS/2
warp was a hard show to follow!

So to wrap up this mini report, I would like to state that OS/2
advocates have nothing to worry about in regards to Chicago!  I myself
anticipated a far better showing and I was quite frankly surprised at how
poorly it did.

Just as surprising was the reception it got from the Vancouver PC
Users Society (a long time staunch supporter of Microsoft).  The howls
of laughter when shown this wonderfull new technology from Microsoft,
that all the press is fawning over, finally hit the audience.  When
they finally did see what all the hoopla was all about they discovered it
was all about nothing!

The majority in attendance went away with a new appreciation of Warp
II.

It was fortunate that Vancouver hosted a WARP II sellout demonstration
the day before this preview of Chicago as many who visited the Warp II
demo to see this new OS/2 were also Windows users anticipating a good
showing of Chicago. The fact that they were held on succesive days
allowed direct comparisons.

Chicago was completly blown away, and many new OS/2 users are expected
to attend future OS/2 user group meetings as well as become new OS/2
users.

I might add that the Vancouver OS/2 users group and the Vancouver PC
Users Society, were responsible for the famous Vancouver OS Shootout
that never was.

That was when Microsoft, pulled out of the planned demonstration and
would not show NT against OS/2 2.1.  Now I can also understand why
Microsoft will not show Chicago against OS/2.  Proof of that was seen by
many Thursday night!

PS to the crew at IBM.......  no worries!!!!!  Chicago will not be
ready for at least a year!  Take your time with Warp II and make it
the best 32 bit operating system it can be!  There is nothing to worry
about with Chicago in its present state, and I feel it has more than 2
years to catch up to OS/2.
