In the last decade, participatory approaches to design have gained
adherents around the world. These approaches have at their core the
involvement of users in the design and development of new technologies
and work practices.  CPSR's Third Conference on Participatory Design
will be attended by an international community of researchers and
practitioners, and is being held immediately following aand in the
same location a CSCW.  We encourage those who are using participatory
approaches and those who may be interested in trying these approaches
to attend.
