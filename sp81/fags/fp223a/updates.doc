       How to obtain updates to the shareware version over the net:

If you have FTP access, you can always get the most up-to date version of
F-PROT by anonymous FTP from a number of sites.  Our primary method of
distribution is through SimTel and Garbo, and all "mirrors" of those sites
should always carry an up-to-date version of F-PROT.

The primary locations are

   ftp://garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/virus/fp-xxx.zip
   ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/virus/fp-xxx.zip

   http://www.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/virus/fp-xxx.zip

xxx stands for the version number, for example 222 in version 2.22.

The SimTel archive is mirrored on numerous sites, and in general you
should use the one that is closest to you geographically.

For people in remote corners of the world, without reliable FTP or WWW
access, we offer the "F-PROT by E-mail" service.

To use this service, you MUST be able to handle multiple-part uu-, xx-
or mime-encoded mail messages.  Please do not waste your time by using
this service if you do not already have the software to decode such
messages.

To use this service you send an E-mail message to f-prot-update@complex.is
This is an automated mail server.  No human will see your message, and if
it does not match the format described below, the mail server will just
respond with a standard help message.

For now the following commands are accepted by the mail server. 

Please note that the commands must be in the body of the message, not in
the subject line or the header.

send-as: form
send-part: part_num
send-size: size_in_kilobytes
send-version

The 'send-as' command signifies the encoding that should be used in sending
the file by E-mail.  'form' must be one of: 'uue', 'xxe' or 'mime'.
Please note that this line _must_ be present, unless you use just the 
send-version command.

send-part: requests transmission of a specific part.  You should only use
this command if you are requesting re-transmission of a corrupted part.

send-size: requests that a specific size (in KB) is used for each part.
The size must be between 20 and 60.  

If the 'send-as' command is 'mime', F-PROT will be sent as a MIME message
with Content-Type: message/partial.

send-version is used to check which version is currently available.  Using
"finger f-prot@complex.is" is a better method, however.

Examples:

To get an uuencoded copy of the current version of F-PROT, send a message
containing the following in the body to 'f-prot-update@complex.is' :

send-as: uue

If for some reason, the 6th part of the transmission failed, you could
send another message to 'f-prot-update@complex.is' containing the following
in the body:

send-as: uue
send-part: 6

To change the block size to about 20 Kilobytes, you could send a message
to 'f-prot-update@complex.is' containing the following in the body:

send-as: uue
send-size: 20

And if the 4th part of that transmission is lost, you could send the
following message to 'f-prot-update@complex.is':

send-as: uue
send-size: 20
send-part: 4

Comments about this service should be addressed to: f-prot-request@complex.is
Suggestions for improvements are welcomed.
