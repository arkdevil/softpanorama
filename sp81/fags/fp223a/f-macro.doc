F-MACRO - Scanner and disinfector for MS Word document macro viruses
Copyright (c) 1996 Data Fellows Ltd
 
OVERVIEW
 
F-MACRO is a DOS program which searches Word 6.x and 7.x document
files for known Word macro viruses and disinfects them by disabling
and overwriting the viral macros. F-MACRO is able to parse the complex
OLE2 file structure of Word document files making it very fast and
accurate.
 
TECHNOLOGY
 
This scanning and disinfection technology was developed by Data
Fellows Ltd for the commercial F-PROT Professional package. F-PROT
Professional for Windows, Windows 95, Windows NT and OS/2 as well as
the realtime Windows VxD scanners have these macro scanning features
built in to their normal scanners.
 
If you are running a VxD-based background protection from the F-PROT
Professional suite, you will be notified on infected document files as
soon as you try to open or copy them or when you are receiving such a
document as an e-mail attachment or downloading it from www.
Disinfection can also be done in realtime. A VxD-based solution
provides significantly better protection than antivirus systems
relying on the Word macro language.
 
For more information on the F-PROT Professional suite, see the web
site of Data Fellows at http://www.datafellows.com/ or the web site of
the US publisher, Command Software Systems at
http://www.commandcom.com/.
 
USAGE
 
Give scan path or drive as the first parameter.
 
Options:
 
        /DISINF   disinfect infected documents
        /AUTO     automatic disinfection, no prompting
        /ALL      scan files with any extension
        /NOSUB    do not recurse sub-directories
        /LIST     list all scanned filenames
        /COMPRESS removes unreferenced data from all DOC files
 
Examples:
 
     F-MACRO C:
     F-MACRO C:\DOCS /ALL /DISINF /AUTO
     F-MACRO Z:\USER\INFECTED.DOC /COMPRESS
 
Notes:
 
We recommend you make a backup copy of important document files before
disinfecting them, just to be safe.
 
In order to be able to scan all document files, Word should be closed
down before running F-MACRO: otherwise it will keep NORMAL.DOT and
possibly other files locked. F-MACRO will give a warning message on
such files.
 
If you have document files with non-standard extensions (something
else than DOC or DOT), use the /ALL parameter to check all files.
 
If an another virus scanner still thinks that a document file is
infected after being cleaned by F-MACRO, use the /COMPRESS option
to remove unused slack areas from a DOC file. You can also use
this option if a document has already been disinfected manually
via Tools/Macro but you receiving a false positive from some
scanner. /COMPRESS will compress all scanned files.
 
F-MACRO will turn infected documents back to normal document type,
removing the template attribute added by the viruses.
