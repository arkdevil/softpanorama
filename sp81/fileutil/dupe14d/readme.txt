Dupe V1.4d is a Windows 3 program which you can use to find duplicate files
on your system and clear off unwanted copies.

To install Dupe V1.4d simply copy the files DUPE.EXE and DUPE.HLP
to a directory included in your PATH, such as your utilities or
Windows directory. Use the New Item on the File menu of Program Manager
to place it in a Program Manager group.

The documentation file DUPE.WRI can be read using the Write accessory
included with Windows.

Dupe uses a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) called THREE_D.DLL to enable it to
display its dialogs using a 3D sculpted effect. The program will, however,
function without this library being available (it just doesn't look as
good). If you obtained Dupe from a Bulletin Board then it is possible that
the library will not have been included in the distribution. It may be
available from the same source with the name 3D.ZIP. If you register Dupe
then you will be sent a version which includes the DLL.

Dupe is a shareware program. You may use it for 21 days to decide whether
you wish to register it. If you continue to use it you are expected to
register it (using the form included in the documentation). Registration
costs £15 or $25US (cheques only) and entitles you to free upgrades of
version 1 of Dupe.

You are free to distribute Dupe to friends and to upload it to Bulletin
Boards provided the Help file, the documentation file, and this file are
included and you do not charge for distributing it.

However, shareware vendors should first contact Babbacombe Computers for
permission before distributing Dupe, unless they are ASP or ASA-UK
approved vendors. Disks containing Dupe distributed by shareware vendors
should include THREE_D.DLL, if possible.

If you like Dupe then you may wish to try out another program by the same
author, called Bloat. This is another Windows 3 program which will show you where
all the free space on your disk has gone, and help you to clear out
unwanted files. Bloat registration is normally £15 or $25US but is £10 or
$17US for registered users of Dupe. Both can be registered together for
£25 or $42US.

All prices include VAT where applicable.
