WCompare by Michael J. Mefford

PURPOSE:
         WCompare highlights the differences in two text files.
It also provides full editing and printing capabilities. WCompare is
designed to work with text files only, and is limited to a maximum file
size of 32k.

Usage:
         To install WCompare, simply copy its two program files,
WCOMPARE.EXE and WCOMPARE.HLP to a subdirectory on your hard disk, and
then use Program Manager to add an icon for WCompare to your desktop.
Start WCompare by clicking on its icon.
         Select File|Open to open a text file, then repeat this procedure
to open a second similar text file with which you want to compare the
first. Make sure the cursor is at the top of each file. Select the
Compare|Compare menu item to highlight the first difference between the
files. When you click Compare|Compare again, the next difference between
the files will be highlighted.
         The options for WCompare are set through the Compare|Set Options
dialog box. The options Synchronization Reach and Synchronization
Sensitivity, let you adjust the comparison algorithm to suit your needs.
         When WCompare finds a mismatch, it attempts to find a place in
each file past the mismatch point where the files are synchronized again.
The maximum number of characters WCompare looks ahead for a match is
called the Synchronization Reach. The default value for the Synchro-
nization Reach is 400 characters.
         When WCompare looks ahead and finds a match, it then insists
on a string of consecutive matching characters before it considers the
two files back in sync. This is called the Synchronization Sensitivity,
and defaults to 10 consecutive matching characters (excluding spaces).
