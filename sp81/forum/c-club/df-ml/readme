I couldn't find a df which I found meaningful.

Some would hit floppy disks (even when there were none there).

I didn't use DOS for about 5 years, and now I found out
about extended DOS partitions (and 400 Mbyte Dos disks).
I'm using join (which allows you to map a drive letter to
a path name like the Unix mount command) and I wanted a
utility which would explain my structure to me, where
the "mount points" were, and how much free space I had.

Microsoft stopped releasing join with DOS 6.2, its still
available on ftp.microsoft.com.

With 2 hard disks and extended partitions, I have up to 
10 virtual DOS drives, I needed a tools to help manage
them (I'm using Linux more and more, and that helps
solve the problem).


I originally compiled this on Aztec 4.1d...your mileage may vary.

I'm not really worried about floppy disks (the code for them
doesn't work very well) but I identify them and point out if they're
joined.

I doesn't have many options (I haven't put in the ability to
do:
	df .
or 
	df /some/path
or
	df d:
It doesn't seem necessary...

Floppy sizes are something to ignore.
Sometimes they're useful, sometimes they're not.
I didn't spend a lot of time to understand it (I'm more
concerned about my hard drives).
