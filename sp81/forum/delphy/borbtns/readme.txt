The BORBTNS.PAS unit contains two Delphi components, TBorCheck and TBorRadio
which implement the BWCC style CheckBox and RadioButton.
I loved the BWCC style buttons so I decided to reproduce them in Delphi.
I didn't test them very much, but as far as I know they work properly.
However I've enclosed the source code, so you can modify them as you prefer.
The GroupIndex property in TBorRadio allow you to define groups:
all the buttons which share the same GroupIndex are mutually exclusive.

Freeware, enjoy them!
(and if you're very happy with them, send me a postcard of your city)

All the best
