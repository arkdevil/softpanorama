ALAIS v:2.0  An UPdate on the utility to
create an alias for end-users in the BDE
as install time.  This one is 29k, a little
smaller (6kb or so) and looks better. This
one also uses dialogs instead of WinCRT.
Source code for Delphi. FREEWARE. Use at
your own risk, and make it better if you
can!
