About this manual
------------------

    This document is organized to give step-by-step instructions
on installation and usage of special data-protection driver, namely
the File Defender.  The driver can act as an effective virus-protection
tool, as well as general file security measure.  It does not, however,
eliminate the need for other virus-specific programs, such as scanners,
watchers and disinfectors.

1. Introduction
----------------

    The File Defender is file-level protection driver. It allows
you to selectively protect files from modification, therefore blocking
possible virus infections.  To correctly use it, please read the
following installation and usage notes.

    First, some words about plain DOS file protection. Each file
has set of attributes, which specify how some operations with this
file are performed. Specifically, the Read-Only file attribute
disallows the modification and deletion of file by any program.
This looks like promising way to ensure the integrity of your files:
just set all vital system and executable files to read-only, and
no one can modify them.

    Unfortunately, DOS allows for easy change of read-only
attribute with specific system function. Therefore, any
sophisticated virus can reset the attribute, and then write to the
previously protected program file, implanting itself into it.

    The File Defender changes this. When installed, it enhances
the way how DOS treats read-only attribute of files: now, it can
only be set once, and cannot be removed.  You can easily set
all your executable files to read-only (use DOS ATTRIB command,
for example), and they would be safely protected from viruses.
Actually, you would hear an audible warning sound when a program
tries to remove the protection.

    What if you need to do something with this files?  For
example, you may want to remove some previously protected program,
or run (virus-free) installation utility which modifies the executable
code (poor practice), or want to upgrade to new version of software.
In this case, you can temporarily disable File Defender by pressing
a hot key combination (see below).

    Please note that File Defender by itself does not create
absolute virus protection.  You should also beware of "trojan horse"
programs and boot-sector viruses (for the latter case we recommend
our other program, AVB).  Also, File Defender would warn you
when virus would attack your computer, but does not delete it
from already infected programs - you should use virus scanners for that.
You may receive false alarms, and should be able to distinguish
them.




2. Installation
----------------

    To install File Defender, put the following line into
the beginning of your CONFIG.SYS file:

    DEVICE=[drive:][\][path\]F_DEFEND.SYS

The [drive:][\][path\] parameter specifies the location of the
F_DEFEND.SYS file.

    To ensure proper and safe operation of File Defender, you
should load it as early as possible.  If you install it too late,
or use some non-supported DOS version, it would display an appropriate
message.

    The driver uses about 512 bytes of conventional memory. You can
save the low memory space by loading the driver high using DEVICEHIGH=
(or HIDEVICE=) commands.  To do so, you should load your memory manager
first.

    In rare cases, when you want a "clean" environment, you can suppress
loading of File Defender by depressing and holding the left "Alt" key.
The driver would stop and ask you, do you want to abort installation.
Press Esc to abort, or any other key to continue.




3. Usage Notes
---------------

    When loaded, the driver tracks all DOS calls which change file
attributes.  If the program attempts to clear read-only attribute
of read-only file, it issues a alarm sound and returns error to
the program.  Try this by using the following DOS commands:

	attrib +r c:\command.com
	attrib -r c:\command.com

(You can substitute any executable program file instead of
c:\command.com.)  You would hear alert sound after entering
second command (assuming File Defender is installed).  Now, enter
this command:

	dir /t /a c:\command.com

You would see that read-only attribute remains set.

    Now we suggest that you would protect all your vital executable
files, by commands similar to:

	attrib +r c:\dos\*.exe
	attrib +r c:\dos\*.com

(substitute other executable file directories here).  After that, File
Defender would not allow alter or delete any of these files.  If you
would hear the alarm sound during program startup, or in any
other case when you do not explicitly work with your protected
programs (other than running them), that could mean you have one
of your programs infected and loaded, and virus is active in memory,
trying to infect the protected programs. If so, check what you
have done, and try to find the infected program by virus scanner
(probably, it would be one of that new, recently-installed programs).

    Sometimes, you want to disable protection to allow some operations
with read-only files.  In this case, you should press a hot key
to switch protection off:

		       ┌────╖   ┌────╖
		       │Ctrl║ + │ ~  ║
		       ╘════╝   ╘════╝

    You would hear a low frequency beep.  Press this key combination
once more, and other, high-frequency beep would tell you that protection
is back again.




4. Compatibility
-----------------

    File Defender has been tested and used with many popular programs,
and with most (if not all) DOS versions.  However, there are conflicts
which cannot be resolved easily.  Some programs do not work if they
are read-only (specifically, some programs that use overlays stored
in themselves, configuration programs that write to other programs
they configure, or self-modifying programs).  In these cases,
most often it is sufficient just not protect that one program in
question.  But do not forget to protect system files, command.com
(or other command processor you use), and frequently-used programs
(program shells, utilities, file managers, etc).

    Some programs (program swappers, for example) do not work when
File Defender is active.  In this case, you should just disable
protection temporarily when you run them (by pressing the hotkey).
Do not forget to restore it afterwards!


5. Messages
------------

    Most messages from File Defender are self-explanatory.
Here is a list of them:


*** Installation suspended.  Press ESC to cancel, other key to continue:

	- File Defender waits for you to confirm driver installation.


File Defender: Installation aborted from keyboard.   BEWARE OF VIRUSES!

	- File Defender was not installed due to user request.
	No protection is active.


Successfully Installed.  <HOTKEY> toggles protection state

	- File Defender driver was loaded. Use shown hotkey to
	switch protection on and off.


You must install this driver before any other . . .
or you use incompatible with File Defender DOS version.

	- Either you have some driver intercepting DOS functions
	loaded earlier in config.sys, or your DOS version
	was not supported.  Try to load File Defender as very
	first driver.  If this does not help, please contact us
	for upgrade information.
