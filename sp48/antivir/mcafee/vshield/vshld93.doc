SYNOPSIS 

     VSHIELD is a virus prevention program for IBM PC and 
compatibles.  VSHIELD prevents viruses from infecting your
system.  When VSHIELD first loads it will search the PC for
known computer viruses in memory, the partition table, boot
sector, system files, and itself before installing itself as a
Terminate-and-Stay-Resident (TSR) program.
     VSHIELD checks for viruses by scanning for virus signatures
and/or validation codes added by SCAN as programs load, if any.
All programs are checked before they are allowed to run; if a
virus is found VSHIELD will not allow it to execute.  VSHIELD
also prevents reboots from disks infected by boot-sector viruses.
     VSHIELD optionally checks validation codes added by SCAN
by SCAN to determine if a file has been altered.  VSHIELD has an
option to check for viruses as files are copied or accessed.
     VSHIELD optionally provides access control functions to
reduce the risk of virus infection from unauthorized software.
     Two discreet programs are available.  The first,
VSHIELD.EXE, checks for viruses using virus signatures and
validation codes added by SCAN.  The second, VSHIELD1.EXE,
only checks validation codes added by SCAN.  Both programs
monitor all program loads from all disks unless otherwise
specified.
     The CHKSHLD program checks for VSHIELD in memory for use
in network login scripts.
     VSHIELD will run on any PC with 256Kb and DOS 2.10 or
above.  VSHIELD1 uses 6Kb of memory.  VSHIELD uses 37Kb of base
memory if loaded normally, 3Kb if swapped-to-disk, or 416 bytes
if loaded into upper memory.

AUTHENTICITY 

     VSHIELD is packaged with VALIDATE, a program that ensures
the integrity of VSHIELD, VSHIELD1, and CHKSHLD executables.
The VALIDATE.DOC file describes how to use VALIDATE.
     The validation results for the VSHIELD Version 4.9V93 and
VSHIELD1 Version 0.2 programs should be:

	  FILE NAME:  VSHIELD.EXE   VSHIELD1.EXE   CHKSHLD.EXE
               SIZE:  41,051        11,323         7,839
               DATE:  06-24-1992    2-14-1991      05-06-92
FILE AUTHENTICATION
     Check Method 1:  A2F1          8578           D8CA
     Check Method 2:  0ADB          03CE           12CA

If your copy of VSHIELD differs, it may have been damaged or
have options stored in it with the /SAVE switch.  Run VSHIELD
with only the /SAVE switch to remove any stored options and then
re-run VALIDATE.  Always obtain your copy of VSHIELD from a
known source. The latest version of VSHIELD and validation codes
can be obtained from our BBS at (408) 988-4004.

     Beginning with Version 72, all of McAfee Associates'
VIRUSCAN programs are archived with PKWare's PKZIP Authentic
File Verification.  If you do not see an "-AV" after every file
is unzipped and receive the "Authentic Files Verified! # NWN405
Zip Source: McAFEE ASSOCIATES" message when you unzip the files
then do not use them.  If your version of PKUNZIP does not have
verification ability, then the message may not be displayed. 
Please contact us if you believe tampering has occured to your
.ZIP file.


WHAT'S NEW

     Version 93 replaces Version 91 which generated false
alarms with some of the Vx Virus [Fx] generic strings in files
written with MBP COBOL.  V92 was skipped due to a Trojan Horse
of SCAN that appeared in New York.
     Version 91 adds a /NOREMOVE option to prevent VSHIELD from
being unloaded from memory.
     Detection capability for 52 new viruses was added in this
release, bringing the total number of known viruses to 534, or
counting variants, 1,302.  For more information, please refer to
the VIRUSCAN documentation or the accompanying VIRLIST.TXT file,
or see Patricia Hoffman's Hypertext VSUM.

OVERVIEW 

     VSHIELD is a memory-resident program that prevents virus
infection.  VSHIELD does this by checking programs as they are
loaded by the computer.  VSHIELD will not allow a file to run if
a virus is found, a program does not match its validation code,
or a file is not on the /CERTIFY list--this prevents the virus
from entering your system.  VSHIELD also checks for boot
sector viruses during reboots and optionally checks for viruses
during copy operations or whenever a disk is accessed.
     When VSHIELD is run from the AUTOEXEC.BAT, it is installed
each time the system is turned on or rebooted.  VSHIELD checks
memory, the partition table, boot sector, system files, and
itself for viruses prior to installation as a Terminate-and-
Stay-Resident (TSR) program.  It monitors all program loads
for viruses.
     When a system is booted from an infected disk, VSHIELD will
detect the virus the next time VSHIELD runs since VSHIELD must
be in memory to detect the virus.

VSHIELD has four user-selectable levels of protection:

-    Level I protection, provided by VSHIELD1, checks validation
     codes added by VIRUSCAN's /AV or /AG switches [see
     VIRUSCAN's documentation for more information].  Programs
     failing the validation check will not be allowed to run.
     VSHIELD1 also checks the partition table and boot sector
     validation codes, if present.  Level I provides minimal
     protection only and is not recommended for normal use,
     VSHIELD is recommended instead.

-    Level II protection, provided by VSHIELD, checks programs
     for virus signatures, the pattern of code unique to each
     virus. If a virus is found, VSHIELD will not allow the
     program to run.  VSHIELD will also prevent reboots from
     disks infected with a boot sector viruses.

-    Level III protection, provided by VSHIELD /CV, incorporates
     both Level I and Level II protections.

-    Level IV protection, provided by VSHIELD /CERTIFY,
     incorporates Level III protection with access control,
     specifying which programs can be run.









VSHIELD Version 4.9V93                                 Page 5


Each level of protection has its advantages and disadvantages. 
 
     VSHIELD1 (Level I) requires the least system overhead,
using 6Kb of memory.  It provides only minimal protection.
     VSHIELD (Levels 2-4) requires as much as 37KB of memory;
this may be reduced to 416 bytes by loading into upper memory.

     VSHIELD1 will add an average of one second to each program
load.
     VSHIELD adds an average of one second to program loads and
six seconds to reboots.  Using the /SWAP option adds an
additional second since VSHIELD must re-load itself from disk
prior to checking another file.
     VSHIELD will not degrade the performance of the system once
programs have been loaded, except for programs which load other
programs when the /ACCESS or /COPY options are being used.

NOTE:  VSHIELD and VSHIELD1 should not be used simultaneously.  
       Either one or the other should be used, but not both.

     CHKSHLD is run to see if VSHIELD is in memory.  CHKSHLD can
look for the presence of any version of VSHIELD, or a specific
version (a feature that can be used to update a workstation from
its file server).

OPERATION and OPTIONS


IMPORTANT NOTE:  CREATE A BACKUP DISK BY COPYING VSHIELD TO A
                 BLANK FLOPPY AND WRITE-PROTECT IT 

     To provide optimal protection against viruses VSHIELD (or
VSHIELD1) should normally be placed at the end of the
AUTOEXEC.BAT.  However, if a menu program is run from the
AUTOEXEC.BAT, VSHIELD should be loaded before it.  Popular
menu programs include MS-DOS's DOSSHELL, etc.
     Loading disk cache or network driver programs after
VSHIELD may disable it.  To prevent this from happening, re-run
VSHIELD with the /RECONNECT switch.
     
     CHKSHLD should be run from the network login script.  An
ERRORLEVEL is returned if VSHIELD is in memory.  This can be
used for creating scripts to check and update VSHIELD.


A NOTE ON VSHIELD'S SWITCHES

     VSHIELD is designed to provide a high degree of protection
even when none of the switches below are used.  Placing VSHIELD
in the the AUTOEXEC.BAT file with no options provides sufficient
protection for virtually all environments.  If available memory
is at a premium, the /LH (Load High) or /SWAP (Swap-to-Disk)
options can be used to minimize memory usage.
     Other options should be used only if required due to non-
standard systems or special security needs.  VSHIELD provides
many options for flexibility in meeting the needs of corporate,
network, and secure environments but trade-offs in system
overhead and user restrictions must be carefully evaluated.

     Valid options for VSHIELD are listed below:

VSHIELD /ACCESS /CERTIFY filename /CHKHI /CONTACT message /COPY
        /CV /F pathname /IGNORE d1:...d26: /LH /LOCK /M /NB
        /NODISK /NOBREAK /NOCONT /NOMEM /RECONNECT /SAVE
        /SWAP pathname /WINDOWS /ONLY d1:...d26:

Options are: 

            /ACCESS - Check for virus when files are opened
  /CERTIFY filename - Enable access control (filename is an
                      optional exception list)
	     /CHKHI - Check memory from 0-1088Kb for viruses
   /CONTACT message - Display message when virus is found
	      /COPY - Check for viruses during COPY operations
                /CV - Check validation codes added by SCAN
   /IGNORE d1...d26 - Ignore program loads off drives d1:...d26:
                /LH - Load VSHIELD into upper memory blocks
              /LOCK - Halt system when a virus is found
		 /M - Scan memory for all viruses during install
		      (see restrictions below)
                /NB - Disable boot sector check during install
                      and reboot
           /NOBREAK - Disable Ctrl-C / Ctrl-Brk during install
            /NOCONT - Prevent running of non-certified programs
            /NODISK - Disable boot sector check during install
                      only
	     /NOMEM - Skip memory checking
          /NOREMOVE - Disable /REMOVE switch
     /ONLY d1...d26 - Check program loads from specified drives
         /RECONNECT - Re-link system interrupts after network
                      drivers are loaded
            /REMOVE - Unload VSHIELD from memory
              /SAVE - Save specified switches as new defaults
     /SWAP pathname - Load kernel (3Kb) only; swap rest to disk
        /F pathname - Use with /SWAP for DOS 2.1 systems ONLY
           /WINDOWS - Checks DOS processes under Windows

     The /ACCESS option tells VSHIELD to check for viruses any
time a program is opened for any reason.  The /ACCESS may slow
down programs under Windows or when copying with menu programs.
Using /CV with /ACCESS is not recommended for performance
reasons.  The /ACCESS option cannot be used with the /SWAP or
/COPY options.  The /ACCESS option is for high risk environments
like open university computer labs or software developers.  It
will, for example, prevent a developer from zipping a virus-
infected file into an archive for distribution.





VSHIELD Version 4.9V93                                 Page 8


     The /CERTIFY option prevents files that do not have have
validation codes added to them with the SCAN program from being
run.  This option is for system administrators to prevent users
from running programs that could introduce a computer virus.  An
exception list of "trusted" files can be created to allow use of
programs that do not work correctly with validation codes
attached.  For instructions on creating an exception list, refer
to Appendix A.

NOTE:  Running /CERTIFY without an exception list or validation
       codes will prevent all programs except for DOS internal
       commands from running.

     The /CHKHI option checks memory above 640Kb on 286/386/486
systems for viruses.  This covers Upper Memory Blocks from
640 - 1024K, and the High Memory Area from 1024 - 1088K.  On
PC/XT (8088) PC's with extended memory cards present, the first
64K of RAM is checked twice.  This option cannot be used with
the /NOMEM option.

     The /CONTACT option is used to display a custom message
when a virus is found.  The message can be up to 50 characters
long and contain any character except for a backslash "\".
Messages starting with a hyphen "-" or slash "/" must be placed
into quotation marks.

     The /COPY option checks files for viruses during COPY
operations and checks the floppy drives for boot sector viruses
during COPY and DIR operations.  The /COPY option does not work
with 4DOS or NDOS.  This option cannot be used with the /ACCESS
or /SWAP options.

     The /CV option checks validation codes added by SCAN to
.COM and .EXE files.  If a file has changed it will no longer
match its validation code and VSHIELD reports that the file has
been modified and a viral infection may have occurred.  For
instructions on adding validation codes, refer to VIRUSCAN's
documentation. 

     The /F option is required for using /SWAP under DOS 2.0.
The /F option instructs VSHIELD where to swap from.  The
complete path and file name must be specified after the /F.

     The /IGNORE option tells VSHIELD to ignore program loads
from specified drives.  Ignored drives will NOT be checked for
viruses.  Up to 26 drives may be ignored.  /IGNORE is designed
for use with LAN's that have virus protection and is not
recommended for stand-alone PC's or networks with no anti-viral
features in place.

     The /LH option loads VSHIELD into upper memory.  For /LH to
work, an expanded memory manager such as MS-DOS 5.00's
EMM386.EXE must be used (for 386/486 systems) or QEMM (for 286/
386/486 systems).  This option cannot be used with /SWAP.

     The /LOCK option halts the system if a virus is found so
that infection cannot occur.  It is recommend that the /CONTACT
switch be used to tell the user what to do when the system
halts.



VSHIELD Version 4.9V93                                 Page 9


     The /M option checks base memory for all known memory-
resident viruses before VSHIELD installs in memory.  By default,
VSHIELD only checks memory for critical (stealth) viruses.  If a
critical virus is found during installation, VSHIELD will stop
and advise the user to turn off the PC, boot from a clean
(virus-free) DOS system disk and scan the system for viruses.
For a listing of critical viruses, please refer to the VIRUSCAN
documentation.  This option cannot be used with the /NOMEM
option.

     The /NB option tells VSHIELD to skip the partition table
and boot sector check during installation and reboots.

     The /NOBREAK option prevents Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Brk from
stopping VSHIELD during the installation process.

     The /NOCONT option prevents the user from proceeding after
the "Proceed Anyway? Y/N" message when running non-certified
programs.

     The /NODISK option disables the boot sector and partition
table check during installation.  This option can be used to
load VSHIELD from a network server.

     The /NOMEM option skips the memory check for viruses during
installation.  It should only be used when a PC is known to be
virus-free.  This option cannot be used with the /CHKHI or /M
options.

     The /NOREMOVE option prevents VSHIELD from being unloaded
with the /REMOVE option.  This option cannot be used with the
/REMOVE option.

     The /ONLY option tells VSHIELD to check program loads only
from the specified drives.  All other drives will be ignored.
This option cannot be used with the /IGNORE option.

     The /RECONNECT option is used to restore VSHIELD's link
into DOS after another program has disabled it, such as a
network driver or disk cache.  This eliminates the need to
continually load and unload VSHIELD when logging on to a
network.

     The /REMOVE option unloads VSHIELD from memory.  If other
memory resident programs are loaded after VSHIELD, then VSHIELD
cannot be unloaded.  This option can be disabled by installing
VSHIELD with the /NOREMOVE option.





VSHIELD Version 4.9V93                                 Page 10


     The /SAVE option is used to store VSHIELD options for
subsequent executions of VSHIELD.  Options are stored by
modifying the VSHIELD.EXE executable file.  For example:

     VSHIELD /LH /M /NOBREAK /SAVE

will set the VSHIELD defaults to /LH, /M, and /NOBREAK.  If
VSHIELD is run with just the /SAVE switch, then all options are
removed and VSHIELD executes with its original default settings.

     The /SWAP option tells VSHIELD to install a small (3Kb)
kernel in memory and load itself on demand.  If a path is
specified after /SWAP, VSHIELD will swap from there instead
of the path from which it is being executed.  The /SWAP option
cannot be used with the /COPY or /ACCESS options.

NOTE:  The /SWAP parameter should only be used if limited
       amounts of memory are available for programs.  It is
       recommended that VSHIELD be used without the /SWAP
       option whenever memory permits.

     The /WINDOWS option is used when running Windows 3 to allow
VSHIELD to display messages properly.  This option has no effect
if Windows is not used.


     Valid options for VSHIELD1 are listed below:

VSHIELD1 /NB /REMOVE

Options are: 

          /NB - Disable boot sector checking during install
                and reboot.
      /REMOVE - Unload VSHIELD1 from memory


     The /NB option tells VSHIELD1 to skip the partition table
and boot sector check during installation and reboots.

     The /REMOVE option unloads VSHIELD1 from memory.  If other
memory resident programs are loaded after VSHIELD1, then
VSHIELD1 cannot be unloaded.

     Valid options for CHKSHLD are listed below:

CHKSHLD /DEBUG /Q /V xxxxx /? /H /HELP

Options are:

        /DEBUG - Display version and ERRORLEVEL
            /Q - Quiet mode (no messages displayed)
      /V xxxxx - Check for version 'xxxxx' of VSHIELD in memory
   /? /H /HELP - Display help screen

     The /DEBUG option displays the version of VSHIELD resident
in memory and the DOS ERRORLEVEL on the screen.

     The /Q option stops CHKSHLD from displaying any messages.

     The /V option tells CHKSHLD to look for a specific version
of VSHIELD in memory.  For example, "4.3V84" for VSHIELD 4.3V84.

     The /?, /H, and /HELP options display a help screen.


CHKSHLD's ERRORLEVELS

     CHKSHLD sets the DOS ERRORLEVEL to the following values:

     ERRORLEVEL │ DESCRIPTION
     ───────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────
         0      │ VSHIELD is resident, or if /V is used, the
                │      version specified is resident in memory.
         1      │ VSHIELD is resident  but does not match /V
	 2      │ VSHIELD is NOT resident in memory
	 3      │ Abnormal termination (program error)


OPERATION

     CHKSHLD allows network administrators to check workstations
for VSHIELD before allowing them to log on to a network.
CHKSHLD is not recommended for home or non-network users.

INSTALLATION 

     For optimum protection, place VSHIELD as the last line in
your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  If you are using a menu program, place
VSHIELD before it in the AUTOEXEC.BAT.


A NOTE ON VSHIELD AND NETWORKS

     If network drivers are being used, VSHIELD *MUST* be run
again with the /RECONNECT option AFTER the network drivers are
loaded.  This is because network drivers replace the normal DOS
system interrupts so VSHIELD no longer recognizes program loads.

     It is recommended that VSHIELD be used in non-swap mode if 
free memory permits.  Use of the /SWAP option will slow down the
system and may cause conflicts with programs that fail to
allocate memory properly from the system.  If conflicts occur,
remove the /SWAP option and reboot the system.  If there is not
enough memory to load VSHIELD in non-swap mode, then VSHIELD1
should be used instead.

     Networks other than Micosoft LAN Manager with workstations
running Windows 3.0 and printing to an HPLJ II (or compatible)
printer over the network occasionally have problems with random
blocks of memory being sent to the printer when VSHIELD is
installed.  This is because other network operating systems may
not redirect the printer correctly.  This can be fixed by
changing all occurrences of the text "LPT1:" to "LPT1.PRN:"
while leaving the "LPT1.OS2:" text along in WIN.INI or upgrading
to Windows 3.1.


ERROR LEVELS 

      After VSHIELD has installed itself in memory, it will set
the DOS ERRORLEVEL.  ERRORLEVEL's are used in batch files to
pass along the results of a programs's actions.  The
ERRORLEVEL's returned by VSHIELD are:

      VALUE │ DESCRIPTION
      ──────┼─────────────────────────────────────
        0   │ No viruses found
        1   │ One or more viruses found
        2   │ Abnormal termination (program error)

VIRUS REMOVAL

     What do you do if a virus is found?  You can contact McAfee
Associates for help by BBS, FAX, telephone, Internet, or
CompuServe.  There is no charge for support calls to McAfee
Associates.
     The CLEAN-UP universal virus disinfection program can
disinfect virtually all reported computer viruses.  It is
updated with each release of the SCAN program to remove new
viruses.  CLEAN-UP can be downloaded from McAfee Associates'
BBS, the SIMTEL20 archives on the Internet, the Computer Virus
Help Forum on CompuServe, or from the agents listed in the
the enclosed AGENTS.TXT file.
     It is strongly recommended that you get experienced help in
dealing with viruses if you are unfamilar with anti-virus
software and methods.  This is especially true for 'critcal'
viruses and partition table/boot sector infecting viruses as
improper removal of these viruses can result in the loss of all
data and use of the infected disk(s).  [For a listing of critcal
viruses, please refer to the VIRUSCAN documentation.]
     For qualified assistance in removing a virus, please
contact McAfee Associates directly or any of the Authorized
McAfee Associates Agents in your area.  Agents may charge McAfee
Associates normal support rates for their services.
     If you wish to remove a file-infecting virus manually, you
can run SCAN with the /A and /D switches to erase all infected
files.
     Before removing a boot sector and partition table-infecting
virus, it is recommended that you cold boot the infected PC from
a clean DOS disk and backup any critical data.

APPENDIX A:  Creating an Exception List for the /CERTIFY Option


NOTE:  The /CERTIFY option is for use in environments where a
       significant risk of virus infection from unauthorized
       software exists.  It is not for environments where new
       software is introduced on a continuous basis.

     Exception List data files created with an editor or word
processor must be saved as ASCII text files.  Be sure each line
ends with a CR/LF pair.

       When VSHIELD is used with the /CERTIFY option only files
that have been validated by SCAN are allowed to run.  If
/CERTIFY with an Exception List is used on a system with no
files validated by SCAN then only the files listed in the
Exception List will be allowed to run.

     The Exception List uses the following format:

d:\pathnam1\filenam1.ext
*comment
     .
     .
d:\pathnam1\filenam2.ext
*more comments


Where "d:" is the name of the drive, "\pathnam1\" is the name of
the path, and "filename.ext" is the name of the file, including
the extension.  An Exception List can be up to 1,000 characters
long.   Comment lines are preceded with an asterisk "*" and are
ignored by VSHIELD.

     Running /CERTIFY without an exception list will prevent all
programs other than DOS internal commands from being run.

APPENDIX B:  Miscellaneous Application Notes


SAMPLE NOVELL LOGIN SCRIPT AND .BAT FILE FOR VSHIELD AND CHKSHLD


     The following is a sample system login script for use by
Novell NetWare system administrators.  The login script gets
the ERRORLEVEL from Novell NetWare and then displays the error
 messages on the users' screens.  The script exits the user to
a .BAT file that performs a logoff if there is an internal error
with CHKSHLD, VSHIELD has not been installed, or an older
version of VSHIELD is present when a PC logs on to a network.

     (Start of sample Novell system login script)
#CHKSHLD /V 4.3V84
	IF ERROR_LEVEL = "3" THEN
		FIRE PHASERS 5 TIMES
		WRITE "A CHKSHLD internal error has occurred."
		WRITE "Please contact the Help Desk."
	EXIT "NOLOGIN"
ELSE
	IF ERROR_LEVEL = "2" THEN
		FIRE PHASERS 5 TIMES
		WRITE "VSHIELD has not been installed on your PC."
		WRITE "Access denied.  Please contact the Help Desk."
	EXIT "NOLOGIN"
ELSE
	IF ERROR_LEVEL = "1" THEN
		FIRE PHASERS 5 TIMES
		WRITE "An old version of VSHIELD has been installed."
		WRITE "Access to the network has been denied.  Please"
		WRITE "contact the Help Desk to have a new version
		WRITE "installed."
	EXIT "NOLOGIN"
    END
  END
END
    (End of sample Novell system login script)


    (Start of sample NOLOGIN.BAT file)
ECHO OFF
REM Log the user off of the network
LOGOUT
    (End of sample NOLOGIN.BAT file)

More complex login scripts can be created to send a message to
the supervisor if an error has occurred, update the user's
VSHIELD.EXE as he logs in to the network, etc.
