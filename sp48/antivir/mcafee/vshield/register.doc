                    USE OF McAFEE ASSOCIATES PROGRAMS

     The McAfee Associates  VIRUSCAN  series of programs is distributed
as shareware  for home use only.  It must be  licensed for use within a
business, corporation, or organization, including  government  agencies
and educational institutions.
     If you have or suspect you  have a computer  virus  infection, you
may use the  software,  free of charge,  for a five  (5) day evaluation
period, to isolate and remove the computer virus or suspected  computer
virus.  If necessary, we will provide you with assistance.
     Shareware   distributors  must   obtain   permission  from  McAfee
Associates  before  distributing the software.  Distribution is limited
to the items  listed on the registration  form.   All files must remain
intact, unmodified, and  contain  all  documentation  files  (duplicate
files may be removed). A reasonable disk copying or preparation fee may
be charged.   Buyers must be informed that use of the programs requires
registration or licensing  and purchase of the disk does not constitute
registration.  Updates may be obtained from our BBS or CompuServe.
     BBS sysops running no-charge,  publicly-accessible systems may use
the  software  free-of-charge on their  BBS system -- that's our way of
saying thanks.  All archived files must remain in original .ZIP format.
