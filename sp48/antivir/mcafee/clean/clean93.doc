SYNOPSIS

     CLEAN-UP (CLEAN) is a virus disinfection program for IBM PC
and compatible computers.  CLEAN searches through the partition
table, boot sector, or files of a PC to remove viruses specified
by the user.  In most instances CLEAN repairs infected areas
of the system, restoring them to their pre-infected state. CLEAN
eradicates  all viruses identified by the current version of
VIRUSCAN (SCAN).  CLEAN will also remove unknown (new) viruses
from .COM and .EXE files, the partition table, and boot sector
using recovery information stored by the VIRUSCAN program [See
the VIRUSCAN documentation for more details].
     CLEAN runs on any PC with 320Kb and DOS 2.00 or above.


AUTHENTICITY

     CLEAN performs a self-test when run.  If CLEAN has been
modified in any way, a warning will be displayed.  However,
CLEAN is still able to remove viruses.  If CLEAN reports that
it has been damaged, a new, clean copy should be obtained.
     CLEAN is packaged with VALIDATE, a program that checks
the integrity of the CLEAN.EXE file.  The VALIDATE.DOC file
describes its usage.  The VALIDATE program distributed with
CLEAN may be used to check subsequent versions.

     The validation results for Version 8.6V93 should be:

	      FILE NAME: CLEAN.EXE
                   SIZE: 96,606
                   DATE: 06-24-1992
    FILE AUTHENTICATION
         Check Method 1: C830
         Check Method 2: 06EA

If your copy of CLEAN.EXE differs, it may have been modified. 
Always obtain CLEAN from a known source.  The latest version of
CLEAN and validation data can be obtained from McAfee
Associates' bulletin board system at (408) 988-4004 or from the
Computer Virus Help Forum on CompuServe (GO VIRUSFORUM).
     Beginning with Version 72, all McAfee Associates programs
are archived with PKWare's PKZIP Authentic File Verification.
If you do not see the "-AV" message after every file is unzipped
and receive the "Authentic Files Verified! # NWN405 Zip Source:
McAFEE ASSOCIATES" message when you unzip the files then do not
use them.  If your version of PKUNZIP does not have verification
ability, this message may not be displayed.  Please contact
McAfee Associates if you think the .ZIP file has been damaged.

WHAT'S NEW

     Version 93 replaces Version 91 which generated false
alarms with some of the Vx Virus [Fx] generic strings in files
written with MBP COBOL.  V92 was skipped due to a Trojan horse
of SCAN that appeared in New York.
     Version 91B of CLEAN fixes a bug with cleaning viruses from
network drives, and adds a remover for the Multi-2 virus.
     Version 90 of CLEAN added the 696, 1339 and Troi viruses to
the list of viruses that can be disinfected by CLEAN.
     One new option has been added, the /GRF option.  When CLEAN
is run with this switch it removes nonspecific (new or unknown)
viruses using recovery information stored by VIRUSCAN program in
a separate file.
     Please refer to the enclosed VIRLIST.TXT file for a short
description of the new viruses.  For more detailed descriptions,
please refer to Patricia Hoffman's virus summary listing (VSUM).

			
OVERVIEW

     CLEAN searches the system for viruses to remove.  When an
infected file is found, CLEAN isolates and removes the virus and
in most cases repairs the infected file and restores it to
normal operation.  If the file is infected with an uncommon
virus, CLEAN displays a warning message asking whether to
overwrite and delete the infected file.  Erased files are non-
recoverable.
     Before running CLEAN, verify the infection with VIRUSCAN.
SCAN will locate and identify the virus and provide the I.D.
code used by CLEAN.  The I.D. is displayed inside the square
brackets, "[" and "]."  For example, the I.D. code for the
Jerusalem virus is displayed as "[Jeru]".  This I.D. must
be used with CLEAN to remove the virus.  The square brackets
"[" and "]" MUST be included.
     If SCAN finds an unknown virus in a file that has had
validation or recovery data stored for it, it will warn that an
infection has occurred.  It will not, however,  display an I.D.
code.
     NOTE:  When CLEAN is run with the /GENERIC or /GRF options
            to disinfect files or system areas based on recovery
            information stored by SCAN, no I.D. code should be
            used.

     Please refer to the VIRUSCAN documentation for instructions
in adding recovery information to your system.

*Denotes virus with more than one strain
+Denotes virus which attaches to overlays

AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT .EXE FILES:  Some viruses infecting .EXE
files may not be removed successfully if the .EXE loads itself
as an internal overlay.  Instead of attaching to the end of the
.EXE file, the virus may attach to the beginning of the overlay
area, and corrupt the program.  CLEAN will truncate files
infected in this manner.  If a file no longer runs after being
cleaned, replace it from the manufacturer's original disk or
virus-free backups.

AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT PARTITION TABLE VIRUSES (e.g., Stoned):
Removing a partition table-infecting virus like the Stoned
can cause loss of the partition table on systems partitioned
with programs other than DOS, e.g., Disk Manager or SpeedStor.
As a precaution, back up all critical data before running CLEAN.
Loss of the partition table can result in the LOSS OF ALL DATA
ON THE DISK.

OPERATION and OPTIONS

IMPORTANT NOTE:  TURN OFF YOUR PC AND BOOT FROM A CLEAN DOS
                 SYSTEM-BOOTABLE DISK BEFORE BEGINNING.  RUN
                 CLEAN FROM A WRITE-PROTECTED DISK TO PREVENT
                 INFECTION OF THE CLEAN.EXE PROGRAM FILE.

     Power down the infected system and boot from a clean,
write-protected system-bootable diskette.  This insures that the
virus is not in system memory and prevents reinfection.  After
cleaning, power down the PC, boot from the system disk, and run
VIRUSCAN to ensure the system has been successfully disinfected.
After cleaning the hard disk, copy the SCAN and CLEAN programs
on to it and and check all floppy disks that have been in
contact with the system.

     CLEAN displays the name of infected files or system areas,
the virus found, and reports a "successful" disinfection for
each virus removed.  If a file has multiple infections, CLEAN
will report the virus has been removed successfully for each
infection.

     Select valid options for CLEAN-UP from the list below:

CLEAN d1: ... d26: [virus I.D.] /A /E .xxx .yyy. .zzz /FR
                   /GENERIC /GRF filename /MAINT /MANY /M
                   /NOEXPIRE /NOPAUSE /REPORT d:filename /SP
                   /UNATTEND

Options are:

                   /A - Check all files for viruses
    /E .xxx .yyy .zzz - Clean overlay extensions .xxx .yyy .zzz
		  /FR - Display messages in French
             /GENERIC - Clean unknown viruses
                        (see below for specifics)
         /GRF filename - Clean unknown viruses using recovery
                        data file
               /MAINT - Clean "invalid media" error (damaged)
                        disk
                /MANY - Check multiple floppies
            /NOEXPIRE - Do not display expiration notice
	     /NOPAUSE - Disable screen prompting
     /REPORT filename - Create report of cleaned files
		  /SP - Display messages in Spanish
         d1: ... d26: - indicate drives to be cleaned
         [virus I.D.] - Virus identification code provided by
                        SCAN when a virus is detected (See the
                        VIRLIST.TXT file for a complete list.)

                 NOTE:  The square brackets "[" and "]" are required.

CLEAN-UP Version 8.6V93                                Page 6


     The /A option checks all files on the disk.  This should
be used only if a file-infecting virus is detected.  This option
takes priority over the /E option.

     The /E option allows the user to specify an extension or
set of extensions to clean.  Extensions should include a period
"." and each extension must be separated by a space.  Up to
three extensions may be added with the /E.  If more extensions
are required, use the /A option instead.

     The /FR option tells CLEAN to display all messages in
French.  This option cannot be used with the /SP (Spanish)
option.

     The /GENERIC option is used to clean files or system areas
that have been infected with a new (unknown) virus.  For
/GENERIC to work, recovery information must have been stored
prior to infection by VIRUSCAN's /AG option.  No virus I.D. code
is required when using the /GENERIC switch.

     The /GRF option is used to clean files or system areas that
have been infected by a new (unknown) virus.  For /GRF to work,
recovery data and validation codes must have been saved by
VIRUSCAN's /AF option.  The syntax is /GRF filename, where
"filename" drive, path and name of the recovery file used. When
using the /GRF option, no virus I.D. code is required for CLEAN.

    The /MAINT option is used to clean hard disks partitioned
with MS-DOS 4.0 or above that have been damaged by a boot sector
or partition table virus.  Disks damaged in this manner give an
"invalid media" message whenever accessed.  The /MAINT option
cleans the partition table and boot sector only.

     The /MANY option is used to clean multiple floppy disks.
If you have more than one floppy disk to check for viruses, the
/MANY option allows you to check them without running CLEAN
multiple times.

     The /NOEXPIRE option disables the warning message from
CLEAN displayed after seven months warning that it may no longer
be current with respect to known viruses.

     The /NOPAUSE option disables the "More? (H = Help)" prompt
displayed when CLEAN fills a screen with messages.  This
allows CLEAN to be run on PC's with severe infections sans
operator assistance.

     The /REPORT option saves a list of infected files to
disk in ASCII text format.  If a report exists, it will be
overwritten with the new report.  The syntax is /REPORT filename
where "filename" is the drive, path and name for the report
file.
CLEAN-UP Version 8.6V93                                Page 7


     The /SP option tells CLEAN to display all messages in
Spanish.  This option can not be used with the /FR (French)
option.
