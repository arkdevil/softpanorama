                        -------------------------


MAM is a DOS memory utility for the PC with many uses.  It may
be used to view the state of memory including upper memory (UMB),
expanded (EMS) and extended (XMS) memory.  Various display options
are provided to view TSR's, system memory use, device drivers, etc.
either separately or together.  Interrupt vectors used by each
TSR or memory area are displayed.  MAM will attempt to identify
inconsistent memory setups such as EMS page frames conflicting
with installed ROMS or suspect programs lurking at the top of DOS
memory (as many boot-sector viruses do).

Furthermore MAM may be used to manage memory.  Similar to the
popular MARK and RELEASE programs, it provides facilities to
first mark memory usage and later restore memory usage back.
Unlike most other programs however, MAM attempts to restore the
entire memory configuration including high RAM, device drivers
and expanded memory (EMS).  Each memory mark may be numbered and
used selectively.  Memory marks are written to a hidden file on
the current drive's root and occupy no memory (RAM) space.

MAM also displays the PC hardware state and allows for saving and
restoring the CMOS state on most AT compatible machines.

MAM is provided as shareware and may be copied and distributed
as you like. It is provided as-is and I don't claim it will work
perfectly for all installations.  It was written to provide me
with the diagnostic information I need in my everyday work of
supporting complex DOS installations and in particular 386 PC's
with programs like QEMM and 386MAX.  Although it has been widely
tested I'm sure further bugs are waiting to chew their way out
of the woodwork.  As more and more sophisticated programs are
developed need will arise to supplement the information MAM
provides.  I will endeavour to update MAM as I hear of
requirements or bugs.  I will welcome any correspondence (cheques
even more):

Version History
---------------

Version 1.7 - Now mark/restores XMM handles and memory too.  Supports
              HIMEM.SYS, QEMM XMM manager, etc.  Full support for MS-DOS 5
              added, displays programs loaded with DOS 5's LOADHIGH.
              Works with Windows 3.0 in real, standard and enhanced modes.
              Works with programs using DPMI or VCPI memory interfaces.
              Fixed bug with reporting on serial ports and in particular
              with 16550AN UART chip.  Fixed some small bugs/errors in
              memory displays.

Version 1.6 - First shareware release.  Includes support for QEMM, 386-to-Max,
              QRAM, DESQview, all known EMS managers, etc.
