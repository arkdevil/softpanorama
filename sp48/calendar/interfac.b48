Sponsored by the ACM, Association for Computing Machinery
     ACM SIGCHI - Special Interest Group on Computer & Human Interaction 
     ACM SIGART - Special Interest Group on Artificial Intelligence
In Cooperation with:
     AAAI - American Association for Artificial Intelligence

CoChair's Introduction/Invitation to IWIUI'93

The 1993 International Workshop on Intelligent User Interfaces will explore
ways in which techniques for knowledge representation, inferencing, modeling,
and presentation can provide the adaptability and reasoning capabilities
required for more intelligent human-computer interaction. We aim to stimulate
high quality discussion among participants from different countries and from
disciplines such as cognitive science, human-computer interaction,
computational linguistics and artificial intelligence. The workshop will bring
together researchers and practitioners with an interest in methods,
techniques, tools, and technology for constructing and evaluating intelligent
systems.

We invite you to attend the 1993 International Workshop on Intelligent User
Interfaces to be held at the Buena Vista Palace Hotel, Walt Disney World
Village, Orlando, Florida, U.S.A. The outstanding technical program is
enhanced by social events and opportunities for extensive interaction with
colleagues from different countries and disciplines, allowing participants to
take advantage of the many attractions which have made Orlando the world's
number one vacation destination.

Sponsoring Organizations

The 1993 International Workshop on Intelligent User Interfaces is sponsored by
the Special Interest Group on Computer & Human Interaction (SIGCHI) and the
Special Interest Group on Artificial Intelligence (SIGART) of the Association
for Computing Machinery (ACM). It is being held in cooperation with the
American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and the British HCI
Group, a specialist group of the British Computer Society.

Limited financial support has been made available to support attendance of
deserving students at the Workshop to foster the field and expose students to
a broad base of current research.  We gratefully acknowledge the support of
AAAI in providing this funding.

WORKSHOP OBJECTIVES

Advances in multidisciplinary research are creating a new generation of 
intelligent interfaces that use computers to facilitate the interaction of 
people with information, knowledge, tasks and situations. These interfaces 
rely on advanced computational techniques and cognitive science theories to 
build systems that enhance user performance. Such systems can help users to 
accomplish complex tasks by interpreting ambiguous input, phrasing multimodal 
output in ways sensitive to users' abilities and situations, and providing 
effective advice and assistance. 

This new event stems from a prior successful workshop in 1988 on Architectures
for Intelligent Interfaces (sponsored by AAAI/ACM SIGCHI). The 1993
International Workshop will focus on a diversity of approaches to human-
computer interaction, from those employing advanced computational techniques
to those incorporating cognitive and user models to amplify human cognitive
abilities.

Technical Program

We will begin Monday evening with an invited plenary address, followed by our
welcoming social hour.  The core of the conference is a three-day block of
technical presentations, including papers and poster sessions.  These sessions
are followed by a pair of sessions focused on defining and discussing future
directions for the field.  There will be numerous opportunities for intense
interaction with colleagues throughout the community.

to take advantage of the many theme parks and activities. The WALT 
DISNEY WORLD(R) Resort showcases five theme parks: the MAGIC 
KINGDOM(R) Park; EPCOT(R) Center ("Experimental Prototype Community of 
Tomorrow") featuring Future World pavilions sponsored by major 
American corporations and World Showcase which presents an image of 
life in 11 countries; Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park; Typhoon Lagoon, a 
new water-thrill park; and Pleasure Island, an after-dark park with seven 
kinds of nightclubs.

Other attractions in the area include Universal Studios Florida, Sea World, 
Wet 'n Wild water activities park, and many golf courses, shops, and 
restaurants. Within a short driving distance of Orlando is the Kennedy 
Space Center. For more information, write to the Orlando/Orange County

Workshop Venue

The 1993 International Workshop has selected Orlando because it provides
excellent facilities at very affordable prices. These facilities are located
in an area of mild winter weather with an average January high temperature of
71 degrees F and average low temperatures of about 50 degrees F.

The Buena Vista Palace Hotel, an award-winning deluxe hotel at Walt Disney
World Village in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, has been designated as the
Workshop hotel. The Buena Vista Palace features three swimming pools, three
lighted tennis courts, and is adjacent to the Walt Disney World Village
entertainment and shops. The hotel also offers access to three Walt Disney
World golf courses. The Walt Disney World Shuttle System provides resort
guests with free transportation to destinations within the Walt Disney World
complex, including EPCOT(R) Center, the MAGIC KINGDOM(R) Park, and Disney-MGM
Studios Theme Park.

Workshop participants will be provided a significant discount off the 
regular room rates. The Buena Vista Palace will offer a special rate of $99 
(plus applicable taxes) per room, single or double occupancy. This special 
rate will be applicable three (3) days prior to and three (3) days following 
the Workshop dates, based on room availability. Workshop participants are 
responsible for making reservations directly with the Workshop hotel. 

Orlando is a popular tourist destination and hotel space is at a premium.  We
suggest that you reserve space immediately to avoid problems in obtaining
accommodation. To guarantee a room, a reservation must be accompanied by a
check or money order deposit made payable to the Buena Vista Palace Hotel, or
a valid major credit card number. To assure room availability, reservations
must reach the hotel by December 5, 1992.  Any reservations made after
December 5 will be on a space available rate.
