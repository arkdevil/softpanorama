'doz' (do Z) is a simple LZW coder/decoder example analogous to
well-known UNIX 'compress' program by Joe Orost. It works in a
same fashion under both MS-DOS and UNIX.

Initially this code was derived from 'compress' sources and
modified for usage as a part of portable tar program. Since
portable tar become shareware I had to extract compressor into
separate free-of-charge utility (due to copyright issues).

This program demonstrates technique that differs from compress
into two respects:
 - (de)compression primitives are organized in open/read/write
   fashion and
 - it uses dynamic memory allocation for working arrays.
I believe this difference makes 'doz' parts a useful toolkit for
any programmer need in LZW compressor.

The only need in a main program is to demonstrate the other code
usage. :-) To call the program type at the OS prompt

        doz <options> <input file> <output file>

Valid options are
 -c - compress a file;
 -d - decompress a file;
 -b nn - set bits factor (nn stands for bits factor); valid
     values for bits factor is from 12 to 16, default is 16.
     The greater this value, the better is compression ratio and
     more memory and time compressor will eat.
