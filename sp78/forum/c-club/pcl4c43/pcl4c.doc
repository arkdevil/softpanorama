                        *** SHAREWARE DOCUMENTATION ***


         The Personal Communications Library for the C Language (  PCL4C  )
         is an asynchronous communications library designed for experienced
         software   developers   programming  in  C.   Five  compilers  are
         supported: Microsoft Optimizing C, Microsoft Quick C,  Borland  C,
         Turbo  C,  and  MIX Power C.  An IBM PC/XT/AT or compatible or IBM
         PS/2 is required.  The Personal Communications Library takes  less
         than 8K bytes and features:

          o  SMALL, COMPACT, MEDIUM & LARGE memory models.
          o  37 communication and support functions.
          o  Interrupt driven receiver & (optionally) transmitter.
          o  Supports high performance 16550 UART.
          o  Supports the PC/4 and PC/8 DigiBoard.
          o  Supports the BB1004, BB1008, and BB2016 BOCA boards.
          o  Hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control.
          o  300 baud to 115,200 baud.
          o  COM1 through COM16 defined.
          o  Adjustable receive queues from 8 bytes to 32 KB.
          o  Control-BREAK error exit.
          o  18 communication error conditions trapped.
          o  4 ports can run concurrently (more with multiport boards).
          o  Complete modem control & status.
          o  Written in assembly language for small size & high speed.

         Two example programs ( source code ) are provided along  with  the
         small and large model library makefiles.

         (1)  SIMPLE  is an extremely simple terminal emulator program.  It
         is provided as the smallest and easiest to understand  example  of
         communications programming using PCL4C.

         (2)  TERM  is  a  more  capable terminal emulator than SIMPLE.  It
         functions as a dumb terminal emulator but can exchange files using
         XMODEM (Standard XMODEM, XMODEM-CRC, and XMODEM-1K  )  and  YMODEM
         (Standard  and  YMODEM-G) communication protocols.  TERM will also
         send an initialization string to your Hayes compatible modem. TERM
         is in the PPL4C10.ZIP file.

         The shareware distribution includes the  small  and  large  memory
         model  libraries  PCL4C_S.LIB  and PCL4C_L.LIB and the small model
         MIX library PCL_S.MIX.  All example source code is included.

         For more information, refer to the Personal Communications Library
         Users Manual ( PCL4C.USR )  and  Personal  Communications  Library
         Reference Manual ( PCL4C.REF ).
