Paragraph 1: Object of Agreement

Software Certificate (called "License"). The Licensee gains a 
non-exclusive and non-transferrable license to use the software 
stated in the Software Certificate (called "Software") according 
to the statements in the Software Certificate.

With the License, the Licensee gains the right to use the 
Software for the Licensee's own business, within the bounds of 
the conditions in the Software Certificate. The usufruct of the

third party (called "Others"). The Licensee is not allowed to

support. This support is recompensed by the Licensee according to
conditions to be agreed.

Paragraph 4: Guarantee

Licensor and Licensee agree that, according to the state of 
technology, faults in the Software cannot be made impossible, even 
if taking greatest care. They further agree that faults are 
present exactly in the case if the Software fails within the kind 
of usage that was documented by the Licensor. Provided the case 
that the faults are reproducable and appear in the latest 
unmodified version of the Software, and are furtherly not caused 
by mistakes in usage or faults in the operating system, the extent
of guarantee is that the Licensor tries to remove these faults or 
develops an alternative solution and provides this or a modified 
version to the Licensee. Further rights or claims, especially 
these for compensation (including consequential damages), cannot 
be considered. The guarantee of the Licensor exclusively relates 
to the original version, as delivered to the Licensee.

Pargarph 5: Liability

The Licensor is not liable for direct, nor indirect damages that 
result from using the Software or the documentation of the

in the Software Certificate, independently from the reason. The 
Licensor is not liable for lost profit, missed savings, damages 
out of Others' claims nor other indirect or consequential damages, 
nor for recorded data.

Paragraph 6: Licensing fee, Right of Withdrawal

For the rights given by this agreement, the Licensee has to pay 
the licensing fee, as stated in the Software Certificate, to the 
Licensor. The Licensee has a right of withdrawal within the period 
of testing as stated in the Software Certificate, beginning with 
delivery of the Software. At a withdrawal of the Licensee, any 
documents, i.e. documentation and data media (original and 
back-ups), must be returned. The agreement then becomes invalid. 
The single license fee immediately falls due after invoice date 
and the end of the period of testing. The fees for additional 
works of the Licensor fall due immediately after invouice date.
All fees are without VAT. This is additionally charged according 
to legal requirements.

copyright, or right of property in the Software, except the one 
right to use the Software according to the conditions of this 
agreement.

Paragraph 8: Period of Agreement

This agreement comes into force with the Licensee installing the
Software on his computer system. The period of validity of this
agreement is unlimited. Any Software Certificate is cancellable 
with the period stated there. At cancellation of a Software 
Certificate, the Licensee commits himself to return the documents 
(consisting of documentation and data media) that were delivered 
to him, including all back-up copies, and to pay any due fees.

Paragraph 9: General Conditions
