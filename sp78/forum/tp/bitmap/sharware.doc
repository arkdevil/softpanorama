* What is Shareware? *		(Definition is copr. ASP)
**********************

"Shareware is an exciting marketing method which allows you to try 
top-quality software before you pay the author. With Shareware, you 
cannot be disappointed spending money for a program that's not right
for you. The small fee you pay to Shareware distributors covers only
the duplication and distribution costs and permits you to evaluate
the program.

If you continue to use the program, you must send the author an 
additional payment which may entitle you to technical support, 
bonus programs, and more. Your payment supports authors, allowing
them to continue writing newer and better Shareware software."

Our programming tools are available as simple and as DPMI-capable version.
The latter is - of course - also compilable in real mode. The registered/
licensed versions include COMPLETE SOURCE CODE.

1  The MyMouse Software Package 1.5
-----------------------------------

  - MyMouse is the finest mouse control unit available.  It is NOT such a
    petty interface unit for controlling the mouse driver.  MyMouse provides
    new service routines, which draw the graphics mouse cursor.  So, you
    can define cursors of any size and color.  This produces Windows comfort
    (32 x 32 pixels) in DOS programs -- and still more (100 x 100 is no
    problem at all).  Mouse cursors can be adapted automatically to graphical
    control elements on the screen.  The cursor's hide-and-show flickering
    is largely avoided.  SVGA support, direct support for Microsoft and
    Mouse Systems mice (no driver required), driver-bound support for any
    mouse. The latest features: VESA support (up to 1024x768x256), and
    anti-flickering timing logic.

  - MyFonts is the universal font management unit.  It allows the output of
    VGA BIOS fonts as well as Windows bitmap, Windows vector (scalable) and
    MS DOS codepage-specific fonts in your Pascal programs.  In addition,
    scalable BGI fonts are supported directly.  All fonts are handled in a
    flexible, font-independent and consistent way.  Bold font versions can
    be synthesized, TV markers and character spacing are supported directly,
    Windows text metrics are supported.  SVGA support.

  - VgaMem is the VGA rest memory management unit.  It provides highly-
    optimized copying routines and graphical operations.  VGA rest memory
    (about 100 K at standard resolution) is dynamically allocated and freed,
    graphical images are stored efficiently there.  Further, Graph's PutImage
    routine is replaced by one capable of clipping.  SVGA support.

! The registered version includes the following "small tools" (refer to
  TOOLS.DOC for more information): WinRes, Clipboard, Mouse Animate, Profile.

2  Graphics Vision 2.0
----------------------

	NOTE: There is a program called "Graphic Vision" on some FTP
	      servers, which should not be mixed up with our Graphics
              Vision. (You would notice the difference in the program
	      description.)

  Graphics Vision is an object-oriented class library, which provides an SAA
  graphical user interface with MS Windows look but is *fully compatible*
  with Borland's text mode library Turbo Vision 2.0. That means, existing
  Turbo Vision programs can be made run in graphics with little changes.
  Thus, Graphics Vision is not only the graphic enhancement for your
  Turbo Vision programs but also a real alternative to Windows programming
  and the OW Library.
  
  Graphics Vision is not a simple text-in-graphics emulation of Turbo
  Vision, but an object hierarchy, which bases on Turbo Vision's objects
  and provides a new, full-graphic object hierarchy, whose functionality
  enhances and outperforms Turbo Vision's capabilities.
  
  Graphics Vision is extremely fast through highly-optimized graphical 
  routines and good algorithms. With it, you can have nice and efficient 
  graphical interfaces for your DOS programs. 

  Some of the features are:
  * an intelligent window management,
  * hierarchial pull-down menus, including bitmapped items and check marks,
  * context-sensitive help, including hints and hypertext help,
  * highly-developped graphical dialog elements,
  * SVGA support,
  * input validation,
  * support of Windows bitmapped and scalable fonts,
  * reading Windows dialog/menu templates

  The registered/licensed version of Graphics Vision is shipped together
  with the MetaGraph and the MyMouse Package, both highly-optimized 
  graphics packages, which outperform the BGI in speed and features,
  and which are intensively used by Graphics Vision. 
  Also included are a lot of small tools (refer to
  TOOLS.DOC for more information): WinRes, Clipboard, GvEyes, GvWList,
  Profile, EditDemo, GvWinDlg, GvHelp, GvGauges.

3  MetaGraph  1.0
-----------------

  MetaGraph provides highly-optimized graphical routines, which replace
  the functions of the Graph unit.  It provides efficient 
  directly-implemented graphical operations and SVGA support.  

  The greatest thing: MetaGraph supports the Metafile conception, 
  such that you may record complex graphic operations and play them
  at an enormous speed, which may let your programs up to twice as
  fast!


A p p l i c a t i o n   P r o g r a m s

4  Chemical Molecules 3.0  (German version only)
-------------------------

  Three-dimensional view of chemical molecules, which can easily be 
  built by the user.  Atom radii are stored within the program, such 
  that you only need to specify the element.
  
  Chemical Molecules has a fantastic Windows-like graphical user 
  interface, though running in DOS.  It includes a Multiple Document 
  Interface for several molecules displayed at the same time.  

  Flicker-free, smooze and fast animations of the molecules are 
  provided through an optimized integer arithmetic and optimized 
  graphical routines. These animations provide a perfect view on
  the three-dimensional molecular structure. Atoms, bindings, and
  element symbols can be individually switched on and off. An extra
  feature is the calculation of the sum formula.

5  Formula Editor for DOS 1.00  (German version only)
------------------------------

  This is a nice tool for easily printing well-formed mathematical 
  formulae. Operators and structures can be defined individually.
