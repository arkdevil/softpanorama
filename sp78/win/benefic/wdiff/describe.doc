LONG DESCRIPTION:
 WDiff is a windows application which displays the differences
 between two text files or between two directories or ZIP
 archives. The two text files (or directories) are displayed
 side by side. Common and different sections are clearly 
 marked with separator lines and different colors. The display 
 window is scrollable in all directions. The middle line which 
 separates the two sides can be moved in either direction to
 see more of the left or right side. It is also possible to 
 jump between common and different sections. This utility is
 especially useful for programmers who wants to see the 
 differences between two versions of a source text file or 
 to show the differences between two sets of files, where 
 one or both sets can reside in a ZIP archive. 
 There are various formatting and comparison options 
 available.
