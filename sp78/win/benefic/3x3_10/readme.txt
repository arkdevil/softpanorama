3x3 Labeler is an easy-to-use method of producing labels for 3 1/2"
disks.  The label will contain a list of the files on the disk, as
well as a banner (title) and edge text.

3x3 Labeler is distributed as a .ZIP file, containing 3x3.EXE,
3x3.HLP, THREED.VBX and this file.  Place the .VBX file into your
windows\system directory, and the other files anywhere.

3x3 Labeler requires the Visual Basic 3.0 runtime, named VBRUN300.DLL.
This can be obtained from most BBS's, online services, Microsoft, and
from TANSTAAFL Software with program registration.
