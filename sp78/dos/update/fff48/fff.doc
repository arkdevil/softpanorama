                            HARDWARE SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

        FF2,  FFF,  and  FFD can be run on any DOS based PC having a CGA, MDA,
        EGA, VGA, or HERC monitor.
        The  DOS  operating  system must be 3.1 or greater.  Both program will
        also  operate  correctly  in  the DOS compatibility box of OS/2 1.2 or
        greater.  Token ring networks or Novell networks are also supported.
        DOS  memory  requirements  range  from a low of 160K to a high of 400K
        depending on how the FFF program is configured.

                                      QUICK START
        The  FF2  program  performs  file  search operations and will show the
        results on the screen or the output can be redirected to a file.

        The  FFF  program performs file search operations and will display the
        results on the screen in a scrollable window.  Numerous operations can
        then be performed on user selected files.

        The  FFD program performs directory search operations and will display
        the results on the screen in a scrollable window.

        FF2,  FFF,  and FFD use basically the same format for the command line
        option.    All command line parameters MUST be separated by blanks and
        all options MUST begin with a forward slash /.  The options may appear
        anywhere    on  the  command line.  The format of the command line for
        both programs is:

        FFx [options]  [[drives:] [filespec]] [options]

        If  the  drives parameter is omitted the programs will search all hard
        drives  that  can  be identified.  If the drives parameter is included
        then  only  the  drives  specified  will be searched. (PLEASE NOTE THE
        COLON MUST BE ENTERED AFTER THE DRIVE LETTERS).


                          FileFinder Version 4.7 User Manual           Page-4-


                               PERFORMING A FUZZY SEARCH

        Both  FF2  and FFF can also perform a fuzzy search.  This is useful if
        you  are  trying  to  locate a file but don't know the exact filename.
        The  fuzzy search routine will attempt to locate files that sound like
        the filename entered on the command line.  To indicate that you want a
        fuzzy  search  use  the  /~ command line parameter.  PLEASE NOTE: WHEN
        PERFORMING  A  FUZZY  SEARCH DO NOT INCLUDE A FILE EXTENSION.  See the
        examples below.

        If the colon is entered without any drive letter preceding it then FFF
        and FF2 will only search for files on the current default disk drive.

        For example:

        FFF : *.bat

        This  will search for all files on the current default drive that have
        a file extension of bat.

        Multiple  filespecs  may  be  entered along with multiple drives.  For
        example:

        FF2  *.BAK CD: \UTILITY\*.COM  DE: \TEMP\*.*  C:\JIM\*.*

        This example will:
        1)   Find  all files that have a file extension of BAK that resides on
             any identifiable hard drive.

        2)   Find  all  files that have a file extension of COM in the UTILITY
             directory  or  any sub-directory of the UTILITY directory ONLY ON
             HARD DRIVES C AND D.

        3)   Find  all  files  that  reside  in the TEMP directory or any sub-
             directory of the TEMP directory ONLY ON HARD DRIVES D AND E.

        4)   Find  all  files  that  reside  in  the JIM directory or any sub-
             directory of the JIM directory ONLY ON THE C DRIVE.

        FFF  QRT /~

        Perform  a  fuzzy  search looking for all files that sound like qtr on
        all drives.

        Any  options that appear on the command line are active for all search
        operations.

                CONFIGURING THE FFF.EXE ,FFD.EXE, and FF2.COM PROGRAMS

        The  FF  series  of   programs have numerous configurable options.  To
        configure  the  programs  the configuration program FFFCFG.EXE must be
        run.  Simply enter FFFCFG at the DOS command prompt and the answer the
        questions  as  they appear.  The FFFCFG program will create an FFF.CFG
        file  that  is  used  by  all FF programs.  THE FFF.CFG FILE SHOULD BE
        MOVED INTO A DIRECTORY THAT IS LOCATED IN YOUR DOS PATH.

        When  the  CTRL-ENTER  keys are pressed FFF can execute a user defined
        program  against  the  currently  highlighted  file  based on the file
        extension.   Up to THREE sets of file extensions and program names can
        be defined.

        When prompted for an extension list enter the file extensions you wish
        to  operate  on,  each  extension  MUST  have  a  period preceding the
        extension, i.e.  EXT1=.ZIP.LZH.ZOO

        When prompted for the program to execute, please include the full path
        and  use the ! character to indicate where to substitute the filename,
        i.e.  PGM1=C:UTILITYSHEZ.EXE !

                          MEMORY USAGE IN THE FFF.EXE PROGRAM

        The  FFFCFG  program now allows you set the number of files and unique
        directories  that  the  FFF program can handle.  The FFF program comes
        pre-configured  to  handle  3000 files and 300 unique directory names.
        Under  this  configuration  the FFF program uses approximately 317,000
        bytes  of  memory. If you increase or decrease the number of files FFF
        can  handle  it's  memory usage increases or decreases by 49 bytes for
        each additional file you tell FFF to handle.


        If  you  increase or decrease the number of unique directory names FFF
        can handle its memory usage increases or decreases by 70 bytes.


        To  determine  the  amount  of memory FFF will need, use the following
        formula:

             149300  + (49 * number of files to handle) + (70 * number of dirs
             to handle)


        For  example, the memory requirements for FFF to handle 5000 files and
        400 unique directories would be:

             149300 + (49 * 5000) + (70 * 400) = 422,300

        The  FFF program will automatically use EMS memory if it is available.
        EMS  memory  will  be used to store directory information thus freeing
        conventional memory allowing FFF to handle more file names.

                                      FF2 PROGRAM
        This program will find files on your hard disk.  It as fashioned after
        the whereis program but has more features.

        Format is:

        FF2 [options] [[drives:] [filespec]] [options]

        Where options are:
        /C        comma delimited listing
        /R        raw listing - full path name only
        /S        short listing - filename.ext only
        /B        list in bat file format
        /P        pause when screen is full
        /Q        quite mode
        /I        also look inside archive files
        /A        only look inside archive files
        /G        Greater or Equal to mm-dd-yy
        /L        Less or Equal to mm-dd-yy
        /=        Equal to mm-dd-yy
        /SD       Single Directory search only (do not recurse)
        /1        stop after finding one file
                  errorlevel 1 returned if no files found
                  errorlevel 0 returned if files are found
        /Z[RHSA]  Show files with specified attributes
        /X"cmd"   execute a cmd against all files found
        /@        Prompt for options.
        /NN       No-Network drive search
        /LN       Look for network drives
        /!        Exclude files that match specified pattern
|       /w        Find  files  that  were  created  or  modified on a specific
|                 day(s) of the week.
        /t        Find files that contain a specified text string.
        /F        Create a fixed format listing
        /SL       Find files with size less than or equal to x.
        /SG       Find files with size greater than or equal to x.
        /D        Display compressed filenames being searched.
        /4x       Also search the 4DOS/NDOS descriptions for the text x.
                  (NOTE:  IF  THE  TEXT X HAS EMBEDDED BLANKS YOU MUST ENCLOSE
                  THE  ENTIRE  PARAMETER  IN  QUOTES.    For  Example. "/4grep
                  program"
        /~        Perform a fuzzy search.

        The  filespec's  that  are specified on the command line can include a
        disk  and  directory. If a disk and or directory is specified than the
        search  will be restricted to the specified disk and directory and any
        sub-directories  under  the  specified  directory.   Each filespec can
        contain different starting disks and directories.

        When  specifying  the  file  to  search  for  FF2 has a quick complete
        algorithm.    If you do not include a period in the file extension FF2
        will  expand  the  filespec  using  the  wildcard  character ? for the
        remainder  of  the  filespec.   For example if you entered FF2 AB, FF2
        will  expand  the filespec to AB??????.???.  If you enter FF2 C:\BAT\B
        FF2  will  expand the filespec to C:\BAT\B???????.???.  However if you
        enter  FF2  B.* , FF2 will not alter the filespec since you included a
        period in the filespec.

        FF2 also has an expanded wild card search algorithm. If you include an


                          FileFinder Version 4.7 User Manual           Page-8-

        *  on  both  sides  of  the  filename, FF2 will find all files that
        contain  the  characters  entered  between  the  *'s  anywhere  in the
        filename. For example:

        FF2 *inst*

        This will find all files that contain inst somewhere in the filename.

        I.E. D:\ANY\PINST.BAT
             C:\ONE\PCINSTAL.BAT
             C:\TWO\INSTALL.COM

        To  find  files  with  no  extension  include  the  period but no file
        extension. I.E.  FF2 *me*.

        If  no  disk  or directory is included with the filespec than all hard
        disks will be searched.


                          FileFinder Version 4.7 User Manual           Page-9-

        FF2 now has the capability to automatically identify all hard disks on
        your  system.    You can over-ride this automatic detection by setting
        the environment variable FF to the disk letter your wish the search to
        be performed on. For example.  SET FF=CD tells FF2 to search the C and
        D  drives  if  you  have  not  specified a disk in the filespec on the
        command line.

        All  output  from  FF2  can  be  redirected  or piped by using the DOS
        redirect and pipe characters.

        The  default  output  produced by FF2 file-size, file-date, file-time,
        disk:\directory\filename.file-ext.  This  can  be changed by using the
        following command line options:

        /C   Produces  a comma delimited listing, this listing can be imported
             into most spreadsheet and database programs.

        /R   Produces a raw listing containing disk:\directory\fn.ext only.

        /S   Produces a short listing containing filename.ext only.

        /B   Produces  a listing that can be used as a bat file. The output is
             as follows:
             %1 filename.ext %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9

        /P   Will case a pause when the screen is full.

        /Q   Quite  mode no output produced but results can be tested by using
             the if errorlevel command in a .bat file.

        /I   This  option  tells FF2 to also look inside any archive files for
             the  indicated  files.   The archive files that are supported are
|            ZIP, ARC, ARJ, ZOO, PAK, LZH, SQZ, and RAR files.

        /A   This  option  tells FF2 to ONLY look inside archive files for the
             indicated files.

        /1   This  option  tells  FF2 to stop looking for files after it finds
             the first file that matches the specified pattern.

        /G   This  option  allows  you  to limit the file search to files that

        /Z[RHSA]
             This  option  allows  you  to limit the file search to files that
             have  specific attributes.  For example, specifying /ZA will list
             files  that have the archive attribute, /ZRH will list files that
             have the read-only attribute OR the hidden attribute set.

        /SD  This  option  informs  FF2  to only search the directory that was
             specified  on  the command line and not to search any directories
             that exist under the specified directory.

        /X"cmd"
             This  options  allows  you  to  tell  FF2  to execute a specified
             against all files that are found.
             For Example:

             /X"del &"

             will execute the delete command against all file that were found.
             The  command can be any DOS command or another program.  FF2 will
             insert  the  disk:\dir\fn.fext of the found file into the command
             where you place the & character.

             For example if you specify the following:

             /X"grep any & -s"

             and  FF2  finds  the  file  c:\data\any.doc  it  will execute the
             following command:

             grep any c:\data\any.doc -s

             If  you  do  not  put  the  &  in  then FF2 will insert the found
             filespec at the first blank in the command you specify, or at the
             end of the command if no blanks exist.

        /@   This  options  instructs  FF2  to prompt the user for the command
             line  parameters.  PLEASE NOTE NO OTHER PARAMETERS ARE ALLOWED ON
             THE  COMMAND  LINE  IF THIS OPTION IS SPECIFIED.  The use of this
             option  also  allows  the user to use the DOS redirect feature to
             feed FF2 it's parameters.

             For example:  FF2 /@ < FF2.DAT

             This  instructs  FF2  to  read its parameters from the file names
|       FF2.DAT.

        /NN  This option allows you to bypass the searching of Network drives.
             If  you  configured  FF2 to search for network drives you may use
             this option to temporarily bypass the network drive search.

        /LN  This  option allow you to search for files on Network drives.  If
             you  configured  FF2  to  ignore  network drives you may use this
             options to temporarily look for files on any networked drives.

        /!   This  option  allows  you  to exclude files. Files that match the
             excluded  file  pattern  will  not be listed.  For example if you
             entered the following command:
             FF2  *.c /!f*.c
             This would list all the files with a .C file extension EXCEPT for
             files  that  begin with the letter F and have a file extension of
             .C.

        /Wx  This option allows you to search for files that were created on a
|            specific  day(s)  of  the  week.  Replace  the x with one or more
|            digits  in  the range of 0-6 where 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, 2=Tuesday,
|            etc.
|            Example:  /W123  This would find files creates on Monday, Tue, or
             Wed.

        /Tx  This  option  allows you to find files that contain specific text
|            strings.    Replace the x with the text string you wish to search
|            for.    For example, to find all files that contain the word TIME
|            use the code the parameter as follows:
             /Ttime
             If  the word or phrase you wish to search for has embedded spaces
             you MUST ENCLOSE THE ENTIRE PARAMETER IN QUOTES.  For example, to
             find  all  files that contain the phrase NOW IS THE TIME code the
             parameter as follows:
             "/Tnow is the time"

        /F   The  F option will produce a fixed format listing of found files.
             This listing can be input to a sort program if needed.

        /D   The  D option will display the compressed files that FF2 searches
             through.    This  can  be  helpful for finding damaged compressed
             files.


        /SLx The  SL option allows you to find files that have file sizes Less
        than or Equal to x.  Where x is the number of bytes.

        /SGx The  SG  option  allows  you  to  find files that have file sizes
             Greater than or Equal to x.  When x is the number of bytes.

        /4x  When  searching  for files also search the 4DOS/NDOS descriptions
             and show all files that have the text X in their description.
             (NOTE:  IF  THE  TEXT  X HAS EMBEDDED BLANKS YOU MUST ENCLOSE THE
             ENTIRE PARAMETER IN QUOTES.  For Example. "/4grep program"

        /~   Perform a fuzzy search.

        The  filespec's  that  are specified on the command line can include a
        disk  and  directory. If a disk and or directory is specified than the
        search  will be restricted to the specified disk and directory and any
        sub-directories  under  the  specified  directory.   Each filespec can
        contain different starting disks and directories.

        When  specifying  the  file  to  search  for  FFF has a quick complete
        algorithm.   If you do not include a period and the file extension FFF
        will  expand  the  filespec  using  the  wildcard  character ? for the
        remainder  of  the  filespec.   For example if you entered FFF AB, FFF
        will  expand  the filespec to AB??????.???.  If you enter FFF C:\BAT\B
        FFF  will  expand the filespec to C:\BAT\B???????.???.  However if you
        enter  FFF  B.* , FFF will not alter the filespec since you included a
        period in the filespec.

        FFF also has an expanded wild card search algorithm. If you include an
        *  on  both  sides  of  the  filename, FFF will find all files that
        contain  the  characters  entered  between  the  *'s  anywhere  in the
        filename. For example:

        FFF *inst*

        This will find all files that contain inst somewhere in the filename.
             I.E  D:\ANY\PINST.BAT
                  C:\ONE\PCINSTAL.BAT
                  C:\TWO\INSTALL.COM

        To  find  files  with  no  extension  include  the  period but no file
        extension. I.E.  FFF *me*.

        If  no  disk  or directory is included with the filespec than all hard
        disks will be searched.

        FFF now has the capability to automatically identify all hard disks on
        your  system.    You can over-ride this automatic detection by setting
        the environment variable FF to the disk letter your wish the search to
        be performed on.

        For  example.  SET FF=CD tells FFF to search the C and D drives if you
        have not specified a disk in the filespec on the command line.


        FFF  will  display all the files it found, up to it's internal maximum
        of 3000 files, on the screen in a scrollable list.  You can use the
        cursor  keys,  Pgup,  Pgdn, HOME, END, CTL-HOME, and CTL-END to scroll
        the list.  Pressing the ESC key will exit the program.

        ENTER
             Pressing  the  ENTER will do one of three things depending on how

             1) The ENTER key will do nothing.

             2)  The  ENTER  key will exit the FFF program and will change the
             default  disk  and  directory  to the one  that contains the file
             currently highlighted on the screen.

             3)  The  ENTER  key will invoke the SHEZ program on the currently
             highlighted file.

        CTRL-ENTER

             The  CTRL-ENTER key invokes the SMART LAUNCH feature of FFF.  FFF
             looks at the file extension of the currently highlighted file and
             execute  the program that is associated with that extension.  The
             associations  are  defined  during  the  configuration of the FFF
             program.    Before  the  program is launched, FFF will attempt to
             swap  itself  out  of  memory  if the memory swapping feature was
             selected during program configuration.
             If  no smart launch program has been defined FFF will than launch
             the default BROWSE program.

        G    Pressing  the G key will exit the FFF program and will change the
             default  disk  and  directory  to the one  that contains the file
             currently highlighted on the screen.

                         MODIFYING THE FFF FILE LISTING FORMAT

        When writing out a file list using the ALT-T keys, FFF uses a template
        that  defines the format of the file.  The template contains variables
        that  tells  FFF what information to include in the file listing.  The
        following variables can be used when defining the template:

        VARIABLE  DESCRIPTION              LENGTH
        $FF  =    filename.file-extension       12 characters
        $FN  =    filename            variable
        $FX  =    file-extension           variable
        $N8  =    filename            8 characters
        $X3  =    file-extension           3 characters
        $DN  =    directory-name           variable
        $DF  =    directory-name           80 characters
        $CN  =    full-path-specification       variable
        $SZ  =    file-size                8 characters
        $DT  =    file-date           8 characters
        $TI  =    file-time           8 characters
        $AT  =    file-attributes               4 characters

        The default format when writing out a file listing is:
        $SZ $DT $TI $AT $CN

        Using the ALT-F2 command the format of the listing file can be changed
        while  FFF  is  currently being executed.  When modifying the template
        please  be aware that anything entered on the template line other than
        a  variable  name  will  also  appear  in the file listing file.  THIS
        INCLUDED BLANK CHARACTERS.

        The  default  may  also  be  changed  by  using the FFFCFG program and
        modifying the listing template when then appropriate prompt appears.

                            MODIFYING THE FFF PRINT FORMAT

        When printing out a file list using the ALT-P keys, FFF uses a
        template that defines the format of the file.  The template contains
        variables that tells FFF what information to include in the printer
        listing.  The following variables can be used when defining the
        template:

        VARIABLE  DESCRIPTION              LENGTH
        $FF  =    filename.file-extension       12 characters
        $FN  =    filename            variable
        $FX  =    file-extension           variable
        $N8  =    filename            8 characters
        $X3  =    file-extension           3 characters
        $DN  =    directory-name           variable
        $DF  =    directory-name           80 characters
        $CN  =    full-path-specification       variable
        $SZ  =    file-size                8 characters
        $DT  =    file-date           8 characters
        $TI  =    file-time           8 characters
        $AT  =    file-attributes               4 characters

        The default format when printing out a file listing is two lines per
        file. Their format is as follows.
        $CN
        $SZ $DT $TI $AT

        Using the ALT-F3 and ALT-F4 commands the format of print line one and
        print line two can be changed while FFF is currently being executed.
        If you do not want two print lines produced per file set the second
        print line template to all blanks via the ALT-F4 command or set the
        second print line template to all blanks when using the FFFCFG program
        to configure the FFF program. When modifying the template please be
        aware that anything entered on the template line other than a variable
        name will also appear in the file listing file.  THIS INCLUDED BLANK
        CHARACTERS.

        The default may also be changed by using the FFFCFG program and
        modifying the print line templates when then appropriate prompt
        appears.

        Where options are:
        /2   25 line mode display
        /4   43 line mode display
        /5   50 line mode display
        /G   Greater or Equal to mm-dd-yy
        /=   Equal to mm-dd-yy
        /L   Less or Equal to mm-dd-yy
        /Z[RHSA]
             Show files with specified attributes
        /LN  Look for network drives
        /@   Prompt for options.
        /!   Exclude directories that match specified pattern.

        /G   This  option  allows  you  to limit the file search to files that
             have  a filedate Greater than or Equal to the date specified. The
             format is /Gmm-dd-yy.
             I.E.  /G01-01-90    or    /G1-1-90  will  list  files that have a
        filedate greater than or equal to 1-1-90.
             (Note this option may be combined with the /L option to specify a
        date range)

        /L   This  option  allows  you  to limit the file search to files that
             have  a  filedate  Less  than or Equal to the date specified. The
             format is /Lmm-dd-yy.
             I.E.  /L01-01-90    or    /L1-1-90  will  list  files that have a
             filedate less than or equal to 1-1-90.
             (Note this option may be combined with the /G option to specify a
        date range)

        /=   This  option  allows  you  to limit the file search to files that
             have  a filedate Equal to the date specified. The format is /=mm-
             dd-yy.
             I.E.  /=01-01-90    or    /=1-1-90  will  list  files that have a
             filedate to 1-1-90.

        /Z[RHSA]
             This  option  allows  you  to limit the file search to files that
             have  specific attributes.  For example, specifying /ZA will list
             files  that have the archive attribute, /ZRH will list files that
             have the read-only attribute OR the hidden attribute set.
             **PLEASE NOTE IF YOU SPECIFY THE /A OR /I OPTION THAN THIS OPTION
             IS IGNORED.**

        /LN  This  option allow you to search for files on Network drives.  If
             you  configured  FF2  to  ignore  network drives you may use this
             options to temporarily look for files on any networked drives.

        /!   This  option  allows you to exclude directories. Directories that
             match  the  excluded  pattern will not be listed.  For example if
             you entered the following command:
             FF2  * /!f*
             This would list all the dirs  EXCEPT for dirs that begin with the

        /@   This  options  instructs  FFD  to prompt the user for the command
             line  parameters.  PLEASE NOTE NO OTHER PARAMETERS ARE ALLOWED ON
             THE  COMMAND  LINE  IF THIS OPTION IS SPECIFIED.  The use of this
             option  also  allows  the user to use the DOS redirect feature to
             feed FF2 it's parameters.

             For example:  FFD /@ < FFD.DAT

             This  instructs  FFD  to  read its parameters from the file names
        FFD.DAT.

                                 SMART LAUNCH FEATURE

        The  SMART  LAUNCH feature of FFF allows FFF to execute a user defined
        program based on the file extension of the currently highlighted file.
        The  FFFCFG  program allows you to enter three sets of file extensions
        and three associated programs to launch when the CTRL-ENTER is pressed
        in the FFF program.
        The FFFCFG program will display the following prompts:

        ENTER/EDIT FILE EXTENSION LIST 1:
        EXT->

        AT  this  prompt enter the first list of file extensions that you wish
        the  FFF program to identify.  The list must include the dot extension
        separator  and there may NOT be and spaces in the list.  If you wanted
        FFF  to  identify  the  following file extensions, C, H, CPP, INC, the
        list would be entered as follows:
        .C.H.CPP.INC

        ENTER/EDIT PROGRAM FOR EXTENSION LIST 1:
        PGM->

        At  this  prompt enter the full path name of the program that you want
        FFF  to  launch  if  the highlighted file has a file extension that is
        included in list number 1.

        i.e.  PGM->C:\UTILITY\EDIT.EXE !

        NOTE  THE  !  CHARACTER.   THIS CHARACTER INDICATES TO THE FFF PROGRAM
        WHERE  TO  PLACE THE FILENAME WHEN LAUNCHING THE PROGRAM.  Through the
        use  of this character the user can also place any needed command line
        switches in the PGM specification.


                             MEMORY SWAPPING OPTION IN FFF
        Beginning  with  release  3.3  of  the  FFF program, a memory swapping
        ability  has  been added.  When invoking the Editor, SHEZ, shelling to
        DOS, or invoking another program via the R or CTL-R functions, FFF can
        optionally  swap  90%  of  its  code to either XMS, EMS memory (3.0 or
        4.0),  or  to disk if XMS or EMS memory is not available.  This option
        is  OFF  by  default.    It  can  be  turned  on  by  using the FFFCFG
        configuration  program.    Using  this  option  allows you to run much
        larger  programs from within FFF than would be normally possible.  FFF
        first tries XMS memory than EMS memory.


                                  MONOCHROME MONITORS

        If  you  are using a monochrome monitor and the screen does not appear
        correct set the environment variable MONO to a Y.  I.E. SET MONO=Y.

                                   MISC. INFORMATION

        Both FF2 and FFF are both DesQview aware.
        Beginning  with  version  3.4  both  FF2  and FFF will now also search
        directories  that have hidden or system attributes associated with the

                                   THE SGREP PROGRAM

        The SGREP program, supplied with SHEZ, is used by SHEZ when the ALT-G
        key is pressed, to scan member(s) of a compressed file for words or
        phrases.  It is included in the SHEZ package for those user's that do
        not have the FGREP program written by Chris Dunford.  While the SGREP
        program performs the same function, it is not as fast or as powerful
        as Chris Dunford's FGREP program.  When the ALT-G keys are pressed,
        SHEZ first tries to locate the SGREP.COM program,  if it can not be
        found SHEZ will than try to locate the FGREP.COM program.  Which ever
        program is found will be the one SHEZ users to scan for text.

        The SGREP command line format uses a subset of the FGREP program to
        maintain compatibility with FGREP.  SGREP does allow the user to
        specify two target strings in the search argument.  These two target
        strings are connected with an and, &, or or, '|' separator.  Thus
        allowing the user to search for two different strings, or two strings
        or words contained on the same line.  When the specific string is
        found, the line in the file that contains the string is written to the
        stdout DOS device, which is normally the display.  The output may be
        redirected to a file or a printer using the normal DOS redirection
        symbols.  The format of the SGREP command line is as follows:

        SGREP [options] "target(s)" {file(s)...|@file}

        Where options are:

             -f   display **FILE-NAME for finds only
             -l   line numbers
             -c   case sensitive search
             -x   no logo
             -e   return errorlevel only
             -p   pause when screen is full
             -v   verbose display output
             -r   perform a regular expression search

        @file indicates an ascii file containing a list of file to process.
        This list MUST include the complete file specification.  I.E. The
        disk, directory, filename, and file extension.

        The target string(s) must be enclosed in quotes and special characters
        can be specified as indicated below.

        Hex byte sequences can be used to search for special non-displayable
        characters.  They are specified using a pair of hexadecimal bytes
        preceded by a dollar sign,$.

        EXAMPLES: $23       include is the string #include
                  $252.50   is the string %2.50
                  $23$24$25 is the string #$%

        Two targets may be specified using the & and | characters to search
        for two targets.  If the & is used the lines must contain
        both targets.  If the | is used the lines must contain one of the
        targets.

        Example:  "save|main"    line must have save or main to be listed.
                  "save&main"    line must have save and main to be listed.

        The format of the SGREP command line is presented here for
        documentation purposes only since FFF automatically invokes SGREP
        itself using a predefined set of options.  SGREP may be run from the
        DOS command prompt, or when using the CTRL-G command option of FFF.

                                  REGULAR EXPRESSIONS

        The regular_expression defines the pattern to search for.  Upper- and
        lower-case are always ignored.  Blank lines never match.  The
        expression should be quoted to prevent file-name translation.

        x     An ordinary character (not mentioned below) matches that
             character.
        "\"  The backslash quotes any character.  "\$" matches a dollar-sign.
        "^"  A circumflex at the beginning of an expression matches the
             beginning of a line.
        "$"  A dollar-sign at the end of an expression matches the end of a
             line.
        "."  A period matches any character except "new-line".
        "*"  An expression followed by an asterisk matches zero or more
             occurrences of that expression: "fo*" matches "f", "fo"  "foo",
             etc.
        "+"  An expression followed by a plus sign matches one or more
             occurrences of that expression: "fo+" matches "fo", etc.
        "-"  An expression followed by a minus sign optionally matches the
             expression.

        "[]" A string enclosed in square brackets matches any character in
             that string, but no others.  If the first character in the string
             is a circumflex, the expression matches any character except
             "new-line" and the characters in the string.  For  example,
             "[xyz]" matches "xx" and "zyx", while "[^xyz]"      matches "abc"
             but not "axb".  A range of characters may be specified by two
             characters separated by "-".  Note that, [a-z] matches
             alphabetic, while [z-a] never matches.

                                   REVISION HISTORY


|       v4.8 October  4, 1994 When pressing the Enter key on a directory entry
|            when running the FFD program, no files were displayed, - FIXED;
|            The  FF2 and FFF programs now accept one or more digits in the /W
|            parameter  to  search for files created on particular days of the
|            week.
|            Added  CTRL-ENTER hot key to the FFD program.  Pressing the ENTER
|            key   will  show  all  files  contained  within  the  highlighted
|            directory only.  The CTRL-ENTER key will show all files contained
|            within the highlighted directory and any and all sub directories.
|            Added support for searching inside RAR type compressed files.
|            When  searching for files inside of compressed files, FFF and FF2
|            will  now  take  into  account any and all search criteria.  This
|            includes  filesizes,  filedates,  and  day  of  the  weeks search
|            criteria.

|       v4.7 September  16,  1994  Corrected  problem  when  running a program
|       against a group of tagged files.
             When running a program against a group of tagged files a ~ may be
             used  as  the  first  character  of the program spec. to make FFF
             pause after each execution of the user specified program.
             FF2  and FFF may now be interrupted during the search by pressing
             the ESC key.
             Added  the  /4  command  line  option to tell FF2 and FFF to also
             search the 4DOS/Ndos description text for specified keywords.

             to  be performed.  This will allow users to search for files that
             contain the ~ character.
             The  ENTER  key  action  in FFF can now be configured to view the
             highlighted  file  using  the  configured  file browsing program.
             (This is the default).

        v4.6 5/18/94 Added /F fixed listing option to FF2 program.

             Corrected  read  ZIP  routine  to prevent machine lockup when ZIP
             file is corrupt.
             FF2  and  FFF  will now, by default, also search for files inside
             directories that contain filename extensions.

        v4.5 12/27/93  FFF will use EMS automatically if available for storing
             directory information.

             Corrected screen scrolling problem in FF2.
             FFF,  FF2,  and FFD now use a common external configuration files
             that is created and maintained by the FFFCFG program.
             When  performing  a  search  on  tagged  files  in  FFF a regular
             expression search may now optionally be performed.
             The file viewing program BRZ is now included in the FFF package.
