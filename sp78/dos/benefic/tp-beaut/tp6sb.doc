Introduction
────────────

TP6SB is a useful tool with many options to format Pascal code in a
consistent form. TP6SB uses default values to reformat the source
code, but with the options you can develop some other shape. It
makes your code OPTICALLY beautiful.

TP6SB - if you want - makes keyword conversion (lower, mixed, upper
      case or according to your own pattern).
TP6SB - if you want - structures loops.
TP6SB - if you want - arranges record and object structures.
TP6SB - if you want - sets the length of source code line.
TP6SB - if you want - inserts space characters to make your source
      code better readable.

But TP6SB does not check for syntax errors.

The original source file will be saved as a *.BAK backup file.
You don't use .BAK, .TPU, .EXE, .COM or .OBJ files as input.
If you don't use extension after the input file name, .PAS will 
be added. Standard wildcards may be used.

TP6SB 1.01 recognizes following builtin keywords:
   85 functions
  138 procedures
   62 reserved words
   33 types
  226 variables and constants

Using TP6SB Optionen
────────────────────

Syntax:

TP6SB [options] source[.PAS]
options are:
-a       : about TP6SB
-b:<f|p|r|t|v> : (one of them) show builtin
           functions or procedures or reserved words or types or variables
-c:file  : get options from a file, separators are <CrLf(EoLn), ,EoF>
           all options are allowed except -a, -b:<f|p|r|t|v> and -c:file
-d:n     : n=depth of loops, default=2, max=10, n=0 => no structuring loops
-f:<u|l> : functions in upper or lower case, default is mixed case
-k       : keep source compact
-o:file  : file=collection of own words, length of words 1-20 character(s)
           contents of line from # ignored, builtin words will be overwritten
-p:<u|l> : procedures in upper or lower case, default is mixed case
-r:<u|l> : reserved words in upper or lower case, default is mixed case
-s:m     : m=length of line in the source, default(max)=255, min=40
-t:<u|l> : types in upper or lower case, default is mixed case
-v:<u|l> : variables in upper or lower case, default is mixed case
-w       : no converting builtin keywords
-y:z     : z=position of lines beginning with { or (*, default is structured

The order of arguments is not significant. The arguments are not
case sensitive. If you use -a or -b:<f|p|r|t|v> options, you will
get your information on a standard output and after that the
program terminates also if you use other command options.

Command options followed by : (colon) must have ONE parameter,
which will follow immediatelly after the option with no space.
< > (angle brackets) give you a possible list of option
parameters which must be present.

Comments in { } or in (* *) and strings in ' ' will not alter.

Options:
────────

-a     Gives you a short info about TP6SB.

-b:<f|p|r|t|v>     Puts the builtin keywords to a standard output.
The keyword groups are: f-functions, p-procedures, r-reserved words,
t-types, v-variables and constants. If you will see more than one
keyword group, you may use this option several times.

  TP6SB -b:f -b:p -b:r -b:t -b:v | more

-c:file     Like a configurations file.
You may save the frequently used options in a file. You may use
the options also in several lines. The contents of line ignored
from a # character. The separator of options are the space, end
of line and end of file characters. The options in the file may
be updated by a command line. You may save all options in the
file except -a, -b:<f|p|r|t|v> and -c:file. If file isn't in the
active directory, you should use the complete path.

If myoptions.cfg is:

-d:3 -f:u
#-y:5
-y:6
-r:u

You may use:

  TP6SB -c:myoptions.cfg -y:1 mysource.pas

-d:n     Switch structuring off or set the depth of stuctures.
Allowed values of n are between 0 and 10. Default value of n is 2.
If n is 0, the source code will be not structured, the original
structure will be kept.

  TP6SB -d:3 mysource.pas

-<f|p|r|t|v>:<u|l>     Switch case of builtin keywords.
Default is mixed case: WriteLn. In u-upper case: WRITELN, in l-lower
case writeln.

  TP6SB -r:u -t:l -v:u mysource.pas

-k     keep source compact
If you use this option, the TP6SB will not insert space characters,
will not structure record and object definitions.
If mysource.pas look like:

type
Date=record
D,
M,
Y:Integer;
end;

...

if(a<b)or(c=d)then
begin
writeln((a+b)*c,(d^.e-5)/f[(a+b)*g.h]);
a:=d^.e
end;

Tp6SB will not make:

{TP6SB mysource.pas}
Type
  Date = Record
           D,
           M,
           Y: Integer;
         End;

...

  If (a < b) Or (c = d) Then
  Begin
    WriteLn ( (a + b) * c, (d^. e - 5) / f [ (a + b) * g. h] );
    a := d^. e
  End;

but you will get:

{TP6SB -k mysource.pas}
Type
  Date=Record
    D,
    M,
    Y:Integer;
  End;

...

  If(a<b)Or(c=d)Then
  Begin
    WriteLn((a+b)*c,(d^.e-5)/f[(a+b)*g.h]);
    a:=d^.e
  End;

-o:file  : use collection of own words
You may give the format of your own words (variables, constants,
types, functions, procedures, ...) in your source code. You may
redefinate also the bultin keywords. TP6SB will use this collection
of own words like the builtin keywords. The words in this file
may have characters only from [a..z,_,A..Z]. All other characters
will interpreted as separator of words. If you use one word several
times, the last version will be used. The contents of line of
collection file be will ignored from # character. The own words 
may have a maximal length of 20 characters.

If mywords.txt is:

MyFunction MyCONSTANT
#WRITEln
writeLN, MYvar

You may use:

  TP6SB -o:mywords.txt mysource.pas

-s:m     length of line in the source code
Default (max.) value is 255 characters, the source may not make the
source shorter than 40 characters.

  TP6SB -s:120 mysource.pas

-w     no converting builtin keywords
But you may use your own words and all other functions.

  TP6SB -w mysource.pas

-y:z     position of lines beginning with { or (* character(s)
If line in the source code begins with comment or compiler directive,
you may definate at which column of source this line begins. The 
numbering of columns begins with 1. If you don't use this option, 
the lines beginning with { or (* character(s) will be structured, 
like other lines.

  TP6SB -y:1 mysource.pas
