1     INTRODUCTION --------------------------------------------------------


      RPCXLib is a CLIPPER LIBRARY with GRAPHIC FUNCTIONS.

      Because RPCXLib is fully written in ASSEMBLER its functions are
      VERY FAST !

      RPCXLib is the successor of the shareware function R_ShowPCX(),
      a function to show PCX-files on the screen.

      This function has been CONSIDERABLY IMPROVED and EXTENDED and is
      included in the new RPCXLib library. 

      RPCXLib is a Shareware product :

      You have the opportunity to try the program at no charge to see if
      it meets your needs.
      If you continue to use the program after evaluation,
      please complete the included registration form (RPCXLib.FRM)
      and send it with the applicable registration fee to the author.


      FEATURES :


      *    RShowPCX function to display a PCX graphic file :

           -     very FAST !

           -     of UNLIMITED SIZE

           -     on a SPECIFIC screen location

           -     on EGA/VGA and SUPERVGA screens

           -     up to a resolution of 640 x 480 x 256 (SUPERVGA)

           -     with AUTOMATIC DETECTION and USE of almost all
                 SUPERVGA adapters

           -     with support of the INTERNATIONAL VESA STANDARD

      *    Functions to mix ones own CLIPPER COLOURS
           YOU CAN COMPOSE 262.144 DIFFERENT COLOURS !

      *    Functions to slowly DIM the screen

      *    Functions to determine the GRAPHIC CONFIGURATION of a PC :
           Is there a EGA, VGA, MCGA or SUPERVGA adapter available ?
           When there is a SUPERVGA adapter available you can, in most
           cases, determine the brand

       *   A NORTON GUIDE with a description of all functions in the library



2     GRAPHIC ADAPTERS AND VIDEO MODES ------------------------------------


      The minimum requirements for using RPCXLib is a PC with an EGA card;
      CGA and Hercules adapters are not supported.

      To show PCX-files (using the function R_ShowPCX()) you can use
      EGA, VGA and SuperVGA adapters.

      EGA :
      When you have an EGA adapter you are able to show 16 colour PCX-files
      up to a dimension of 640 x 350 pixels.
      (Maximum resolution: 640 x 350 x 16)

      VGA :
      When you have a STANDARD VGA adapter you are able to show 16 colour
      PCX-files up to a dimension of 640 x 480 and 256 colour files up to
      a dimension of 320 x 200 pixels.
      (Maximum resolution: 640 x 480 x 16 or 320 x 200 x 256)

      SuperVGA :
      When you have a SUPERVGA adapter (which is supported by RPCXLib)
      you are able to show 256 colours PCX-files up to a dimension of
      640 x 480 pixels. Provided that the used adapter supports the
      640 x 480 x 256 video mode.
      (Maximum resolution: 640 x 480 x 256)

      RPCXLib detects and uses the following SuperVGA adapters :

      -    Ahead Systems, type A & B
      -    ATI Wonder Card
      -    Chips & Technologies
      -    Everex VGA
      -    Genoa GVGA
      -    NCR 77C22
      -    Oak Technologies OTI-67
      -    Paradise VGA
      -    Trident 8800
      -    Trident 8900
      -    Tseng Labs ET3000
      -    Tseng Labs ET4000
      -    VESA BIOS Extensions
      -    Video 7

      When your adapter is NOT listed above you probably still can use
      the SuperVGA features of RPCXLib.
      This can be done using the VESA BIOS EXTENSIONS driver.

      VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association) is a standardization
      in the field of graphic adapters.
      For almost any SuperVGA card there is a little (TSR) program that
      emulates the VESA standard. By using this program, RPCXLib will
      work together with your (not listed) SuperVGA adapter.
      The VESA emulation programs mentioned above are often included in
      the software package that comes with the SuperVGA card.
      When this is not the case you can probably find the program in the
      Public Domain / Shareware circuit.



3     EGA/VGA COLOUR PALETTES ----------------------------------------------


      In RPCXLib the are some functions to change the colour palette of your
      EGA/VGA adapter. You can use these functions to compose your own
      Clipper colour palette.

      Clipper uses 16 pre-defined colours. Each Clipper colour is paired with
      a so-called colour register. A colour register contains the "composition"
      of a specific colour. This composition consists of a RED, GREEN and BLUE
      component (values ranging from 0 to 63).
      Some examples (values actually used by Clipper) :

                       ------- Components  -------
                       RED        GREEN       BLUE

      BLACK            0          0           0
      BRIGHT WHITE     63         63          63
      NORMAL WHITE     42         42          42
      GREY             21         21          21
      BRIGHT RED       63         0           0
      RED              42         0           0
      GREEN            0          42          0
      BLUE             0          0           42
      MAGENTA          42         0           42

      The composition of the Clipper colours can be found in the header
      file (RPCXLib.CH).

      Clipper DOESN'T use register numbers 0-15 but :

      Registers #  0 -  7   : normal colours
      Registers # 56 - 63   : bright colours

      All Clipper colours and matching register numbers are listed in
      the header file RPCXLib.CH.

      Example :
      To determine the register number of the Clipper colour MAGENTA you
      can use the pre-defined PL_MAGENTA constant that substitutes the
      correct register number.

      The use of the palette functions is described in the next chapter.
