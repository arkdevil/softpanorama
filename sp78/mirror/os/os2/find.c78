It's certainly not the answer to the world's problems, but then, it's just
a programming language; perhaps the same statement could apply to Pascal,
C or C++?  Yes?  And what's wrong with AREXX, anyway?

It does have its uses and in many cases; yes, it is that easy.

Low-level?  Like assembly?  Man, that's LOW level!  AppleScript is more on
the level of LISP; certainly it's higher level than C or Pascal.  But with
higher level comes a loss; notably of "raw" execution speed.  It more than
makes up for this however; at allowing end users to automate repetitave
tasks.

Fiddly?  Of course it's fiddly, what programming language isn't? :)

Error-prone?  No more so that other languages; and the exception mechanism
is certainly one of the more robust I've encountered.

Suppose, for example, that in the middle of processing I fill up the
disk.  AppleScripts are designed to allow the execution of tasks without
having dialog boxes pop up all over the place, so it won't.  Unless I
script it so.  At best, it won't complete the task in that manner; if a
disk is full, well, the disk is full.  This will happen even with a
commercial backup program.  At least with AppleScript I can catch the
exception and provide for a contingency; such as saving data to yet
another mounted volume.  Or even have it mount a remote volume; then
save.  The possibilities are only limited by your imagination.

Of course, AppleScript _does_ provide a way of communication with programs
at a higher level; that was it's design philosophy; it's very reason for
being! :)  But now you have all these different applications; each with...
wait!  each with almost the _identical_ interface!  Wow!  On further
investigation; the AppleScripter notices that scriptable apps follow the
Apple Event Object Model which defines a uniform interface; and several
standardized event suites that allow scripters to learn only once how to
deal with certain types of data.  Such as the Text suite, the Database
suite, the Graphics suite, etc...

And AppleScript is _much_ more than a simple event-recorder system!  Check
out the book "AppleScript Language Guide English Dialect", available at
many fine bookstores.

Please do read about it; you might be surprised!  If you haven't used it,
how do you know how easy it really is?  I've never developed scripts in
the Bourne Shell, so I have no comment.  For one thing, the control is
really at a high level; and the horde of supporting apps _is_ there!

Don't know, but since I know AppleScript will be; this is rather a moot

Yes, it did what it was designed to do.  Just another choice in this

Yes, I think the same think about other OSes as well, but you seem to not
know about MacOS very much.  On MacOS I _really_ don't have to worry about
whether the system has the tools installed.  And I can _write_ a script to
check if any needed additional extensions are available that the user may
have disabled, and inform them that my script would probably run better if
the re-enabled the desired ones.

One thing the Mac shows, the simple presence of a mouse and windows does
_NOT_ make for a good UI.  The Mac demonstrates by _example_ that many
other components are required; and I'm left wondering why other OSes don't
take the hint!

Of course the mere existence of a scripting mechanism does not make for an
effective method for automating software; this the AppleEvent registry and
standard suites; these _do_!

On an equal size disk with equal amount of data, the Macintosh find utility
will complete considerably faster than the UNIX find (15 seconds for an
exact name match on a Quadra 700 with a 1 GB HD as compared to 50 seconds
on a SGI Indigo with a 1 GB HD).

Also not true. The current version of SimpleText allows you to change
font, fontsize and style (bold, italic, underline etc).

It seems that your experience with the Macintosh is limited to
a Macintosh Plus running System 6?

Never takes more than 5 seconds on my machine, and I have three hard drives
for it to search.

Why is it that people assume that because the Mac doesn't have protected

You think Find File and SimpleText will consume 48 megs of RAM?  What are you
smoking? :)

In what way is it difficult to interpret the results of a find file command?

Yeah, now your 386 with 8 megs of RAM and 200 users has just run out of swap
space, and it locks (technically it hasn't crashed, but it's now unusable for
all practical purposes since the OS is busy scrambling to dump pages; sure
would have been nicer if it had just said "out of memory" and continued to
perform all other tasks at a reasonable speed).  Yes, I have seen this happen
on a friend's 386 Linux box...

Prior to system 7.5, the built in find command in the finder could only search
for one thing at a time.  Under 7.5, Find File can match based on multiple
criteria during a single search; you can match by dates, name,
size, creator/type codes, file locked/unlocked flags, and I'm pretty sure it
will do file contents as well.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


What? Nonsense. The command keeps on going. If you think this then
you're just clueless, at least w.r.t. the Mac.

I just can't believe how many people are willing to defend the unix
'find' utility. It's terrible, face it. The 'find' in System 7.5 is
waaaaaay better, and there's just not much you can do about it.

Even other CLI-based operating systems  at least have things that mean
'this and all subdirectories'. And don't get me started on the dozen or
so ways to escape metacharaters, several of which are in use in the
find command alone.

Yeah, that's it. Try actually running that command with escaped braces,
and when you figure out what's wrong with THAT, try again. (Hint: if
you run that command with escaped braces, you should type something
into stdin.) Of course, this just supports my argument that even
experienced users of 'find' find it difficult, and highly inefficient.

I love it when people spout the merits of 'find' as an example of the
power of unix. Almost always they post some little find command that
has some subtle problem.

What would the output of the above command look like, and why do you
suppose its not very useful?

There is nothing wrong with that find command. If there are problems,
chances are you are running some broken old shell (e.g.  csh).  In the
Bourne shell or GNU Bash, there aren't any problems with the above.
The {} does not need to be escaped.

I guess that does it, then.  All of us unix guys are out, macs are better
than any unix box. (yeah right) What was it Linus said about macs?
Something about them having memory management that would frighten very
small children.  I use the find command and find :) no problems with it,
and dont care to wait the time required, which is not too long generally
(and yes my disks are bigger than a few meg too).

You could be right, the macs might be great at finds.  I hope to never

I believe the problem he refers to is the fact that grep will return
the lines in each file it find, but won't list the file names
anywhere.  Of course this might be what he wanted, but...

find / -name foo -ctime 3 -type f -exec grep -l blah {} \;

is probably what he wanted.  Of course this isn't an error with find
syntax, but with grep syntax...

200 users on a 386 with 8 MB of RAM... even if this reported figure is off by
an order of magnitude, and it's actually 20 users on that system... how can
you complain about such an OS?  I've got $80K worth of superserver sitting
downstairs that's starting to burst at the seams with just shy of 300 users
on it... the OS alone costs nearly $15K more, but I could theoretically
replace it with Linux for... $0!  (yes, yes, I know I'd lose the cost savings
instantly on software purchases & hardware modifications, gimme a break I'm
trying to make a point here).

And forgive me for having clipped too much up there... but wasn't the original
comparison of a single-user MAC box to this hypothetical 200-user Linux box?

That's all I want to say, especially considering how many .advocacy groups
are reading this thread :)

I'd say that the MacOS is a much more embarrasing example of bad programming.
At least "find" is inconspicuous, and it works.

No, actually, some unix guy said that the Mac couldn't handle a search on
a multigigabyte database for records matching three criteria.  I said
that the Mac could do much better than three criteria on a multigigabyte
database, as is easily demonstrated by it's "find" command.

Yes and we all know that, for some folx, whatever Linus says is gold.
Look this guy wasnt saying that macOS is better than unix, merely that
the find features were better.  Frankly, I'm pretty organized and I
havent used either very much.  On the occasions that I've used the find
utility under SGI's X it has been dog slow (mips R4000 100MHz) slower than

Ooooooo.....big guy runs unix and we all cower at his feet.  Get off it man.
Unix isnt the only OS in the world and for lot's of things it's not even
the best.  I use one of the fancier unix graphics workstations and for
anything other than 3d stuff a fast mac will eat it alive.

name contains soliton.h
date modified is after 7/14/95

What's the problem?

Can your find command detect the presences of a custom as opposed to a
non-custom icon?

Drive access time is also a consideration for this analysis. But it is
important to note that in any search the number of records is the relevant
number to be benchmarking with. Do both drives have the same number of files?
(File size and drive size whould not matter for this). Also processor speed
and load are considerations, if either of the machines are running in
multi-user mode.

The only way a Mac could run faster would be if they had a better algorithm to
proform the search with. Since (as we all know) a linear search of elements is
O(n), and this is probly the worst search anyone would implement (unless they
were crazy _and_ stupid). To be more efficent, a find utility would have to
have a pre-existant data structure that enabled faster searches (Binary Search
Tree, Binomial Heap etc...), but since you are ususlly looking for substrings
(like all the .h files or something) these implementations may have mixed
results (fast on some types of searches, slow on others)

Also, unix find is much more powerful in that it can be used to execute
commands on large numbers of files, delete files, or do any number of useful
administrative tasks. (I'm unsure if Mac has the same capability)

The computers were all macs, then?
running what, A/UX? perhaps that particular variant of unix is
comparatively slow - I find that linux is startlingly fast compared
to say, msdos with respect to filesystem operations. I guess we'll
have to wait for macLinux to do a real mac-vs-unix comparison on
identical hardware....

Speed aside, I really like the UNIX find command because it is
able to hand off more processing to other commands via the -exec
option.  This capability alone is worth it whenever I'm on a UNIX
system.  And while I'm developing programs, I can't live without
it.  Notice you're not limited to just grepping stuff, but you
also can delete items, copy them somewhere else, whatever.  If
the Macintosh's find command has an "execute" option, it would be
great!

Finally, a UNIX user who actually wants to know something rather than
claim that his system can do what the mac cannot.

Let me tell you why the mac (System 7.5) has by far the most powerful and
simplest file finding utility bar none!

1. You can search for files based on any combination of the following:
NAME (search for a name that contains, starts with, ends with, is, is not
OR doesn't contain a string)
SIZE (search for smaller than or larger than a given size)
KIND (is or is not an alias, application, clipping file, document, folder,
font, letter, sound or stationary)
LABEL (is or is not one of any of the predefined labels allowed through
the finder)
DATE CREATED (is, is before, is after, is not, is within n days of, is
within n weeks of, is within n months of a certain date)
DATE MODIFIED (same paramaters as above for date created)
VERSION (is or is not a value you type in)
COMMENTS (contain or do not contain the string you type in [for those
unfamiliar, you can add extremely long comments to your files through the
finder])
LOCK ATTRIBUTE (is locked or unlocked)
FOLDER ATTRIBUTE (is or is not empty, shared or mounted)
FILE TYPE (is or is not - The file type created by an application)
CREATOR (is or is not - any application)
CONTENTS (contain or do  not contain any string)
CUSTOM ICON (is present or not present)
or
VISIBILITY (is visible or Invisible)

But wait there's more.  In unix this would require you memorizing a
different switch for each of the above.  On the mac you simply click the
more choices button and choose which attribute you want to add to your
criteria from the pop-up menu.

But wait there's more.  Say you don't know what the creator or file type
code is of your program.  No problem, choose creator or file type and drag
that kind of a file into the search field.  The MAC fills it in for you.
In fact if I had all of the choices above open and dragged a file into the
find dialog all the fields including name, version, etc would
automatically fit in.

But wait, there's more.  Off course you can cut and paste the text in from
any application.

But wait, there's one more for Unix lovers.  In System 7.5, thanks to the
thread manager, not only does find file run in the background, it searches
different volumes (disks) simultaneously.

But wait, there's more.  Not only does it find the files, it presents them
for you in window list in which you can:  Double click on the files to
launch them, drag them onto an application you want to run them, drag them
to the trash or drag them into any folder on your system.  Clicking on a
file will also present you with its location in the bottom part of the
window, of which you can double click on any parent folder to open it in
the finder.

PS, unlike many other claim you see on USENET, I have not exaggerated a
single feature of this fast and easy to use utility.  Have someone who
really knows how to use a mac show it to you sometime. I think its worth
the cost of upgrading to system 7.5 on its own.

hmm, that's it, I'm gonna write a better one for Linux.  TCL/TK would

well not in all cases, I have seen various X based find utilities that
don't require the memorization.

with Unix find you can do a million more things with  "-exec" and the
other shell tools.  Of course, it's not as draggy adn clicky.

Here you go:
from the finder hit command-f or choose find from either the apple menu or
the file menu:
In the top left pop-up menu (probably where it defaluted to "name") click
and choose "date modified" to the right of that choose "is within 1 week
of" and leave today's date as the default.
Then click on more choices and, holding down the option key, in the left
pop-up menu choose "contents" leave contain as the default modifier and
type "soliton.h" in the text field to the right.

Now either click on the find button or hit enter.

Add "Ram Doubler" to the mac, and that's what you'll get.

Well, I seem to be able to do whatever I want to while finding all files
containing 'soliton.h' and accessed within the last seven days, as is
evidenced by the fact that I'm posting this right now, and opened up a
new text editor to do it in.

BTW, you should really try to be more polite when you post. Inconsiderate
language like you used in unquoted portions of your post will really win
you no friends, and fewer converts to your point of view.

Applescript it. Record your file actions once, tack on the execution

The thing is, you have to move and click on them, they can't be piped
to another program, or otherwise handled automatically by the machine.
While you would have to sit at the box waiting for the find to get
done, I could go get my Mt. Dew.  find on most unix platforms does
need a bit of work tho.

I would say without a doubt that the MAC interface is considerably
easier for novice users to use, but most nixes, wether in GUI or CLI
have a bit more power behind them do to easy interoperability of the
various utilities and the shell languages.

No the Macintosh had over 13500 files and 2000 directories while the SGI
had 25700 files+directories (I didn't bother to count them separately).

Since I am all for fair benchmarks I increased the number of files+folders
to 21500 (ran out of disk...) on the Macintosh and the find command took
15-16 seconds to search the disk.

   I know that now that the Mac finally has a scripting mechanism that every
Mac zealot is going to be convinced that it is the answer to the world's
problems, but it isn't that easy.  Us Amigaphiles thought the same way
five or six years ago when AREXX first showed up.  We were wrong.

   Yes, if you can record, edit, and playback system events, you can automate
programs to an extent, but it's a low-level, fiddly, error-prone sort of thing.
Suppose, for example, that in the middle of processing you fill up the
disk, and up pops a "DISK FULL" dialog box.  What will your recorded stream
of events do now?  At best it will stop half-done.  A robust script that
will handle unexpected conditions is next to impossible.

   Or, of course, you can provide a way of communication with programs at
a higher level, the way Arexx does.  Arexx allows you to call application-
defined routines, that have application-defined behaviors.  But now you
have all these different applications, each with its own set of Arexx
commands.  It's a _LOT_ of work learning these interfaces.  What you
need isn't just Arexx-aware apps, but a standard set of Arexx commands,
so that saving a file has the same syntax in every application.  But
even with the lack of standardization among Arexx interfaces, you're
still way ahead of a simple event-recorder system.

   Now, I don't know much about AppleScript.  But from what I do know,
it makes things possible, it doesn't make things easy.  I'd be astounded
if it was as easy to develop quality scripts as it is in Bourne Shell.
For one thing, the control is at too low a level, and for another, the
horde of supporting apps isn't there.

   As a simple example, how do you, on the Mac, configure a script to
execute every morning at 3:00?  Does it require a third-party or share-ware
utility?  How many such utilities are there?  How many Mac's have them
running?  Have you ever used one?  Are you certain that the one you've
configured will still be running to start that job next February 13th,
even if you've forgotten that it was there?

   I've seen cron-like utilities for Windows, OS/2, the Amiga, etc., by
the dozen,  It's only on Unix that I know that there will always be one
there, and that it will always be running.  Similarly, I know that any
of dozens or hundreds of special-purpose utilities will be there, be it
the bc calculator, or the m4 text-preprocessor, or cut, frm, whatever.
I can just throw together a script on Unix and know that there is this
rich set of resources to take advantage of.  On any other OS, I have
to worry about whether the system has the tools installed.  Sure, _I_
always add awk, grep, etc., to a DOS machine, but I can't write a script
that assumes they are available, unless I provide them myself, which
gets into distribution size, licensing issues, and no end of hassles.


    One thing the Mac shows, the simple presence of a mouse and windows
does _NOT_ make for a good UI.  There is a lot of work that went into
the Mac's interface beyond mouse-drivers and windowing functions.  Similarly,
the mere existence of a scripting mechanism does not make for an effective
method for automating software.  MsDOS .BAT files should prove that,
Apple has made a necessary start, but it doesn't match Unix, or even the
Amiga, by a long shot.

The file command is useful for typing untyped files, but it does not
replace a good typed filesystem:

indigo 13% echo "GIF files don't look like this" > bar
indigo 15% file bar
bar:            GIF image  (0x656c x 0x2073)

Magic indeed! ;-)

You don't have to, just run that test yourself. I find that an SGI computer

No. But I just search for all files modified since yesterday, and it ran
in 14 seconds on a Macintosh Quadra with 21500 files and directories.
You can easily do a similar find on (part of) your favourite UNIX
filesystem.

find has a rather un-unixy way of handling its command line parameters
(especially the -exec one seems like a bit of a kludge). As to what is
wrong.... there is a "-l /dev/null" missing between the "grep" and the "{}".
It still is a very inefficient way of doing stuff (starting up "grep" for
every single file). Not to mention that the "-ctime" argument should be
qulified with "-3" or "+3" (don't remember what actually was asked for).
So better would be

find / -name foo -ctime +3 -type f -print | xargs grep -l /dev/null

>As to your claim about '10 times faster than the Mac:

With my version, it most probably is. Not exactly because the find command
is superior, but unix' disk handling in general tends to be faster.

It all makes some kind of sense.... sure, it doesn't have nice buttons and
checkboxes, but it doesn't require you to mess around with a mouse, either.
And it's always easy to write a GUI frontend to a CLI command, and pretty
hard the other way around.

It's functionality, however, is great.

It's certainly not the answer to the world's problems, but then, it's just
a programming language; perhaps the same statement could apply to Pascal,
C or C++?  Yes?  And what's wrong with AREXX, anyway?

It does have its uses and in many cases; yes, it is that easy.

Low-level?  Like assembly?  Man, that's LOW level!  AppleScript is more on
the level of LISP; certainly it's higher level than C or Pascal.  But with
higher level comes a loss; notably of "raw" execution speed.  It more than
makes up for this however; at allowing end users to automate repetitave
tasks.

Fiddly?  Of course it's fiddly, what programming language isn't? :)

Error-prone?  No more so that other languages; and the exception mechanism
is certainly one of the more robust I've encountered.

Suppose, for example, that in the middle of processing I fill up the
disk.  AppleScripts are designed to allow the execution of tasks without
having dialog boxes pop up all over the place, so it won't.  Unless I
script it so.  At best, it won't complete the task in that manner; if a
disk is full, well, the disk is full.  This will happen even with a
commercial backup program.  At least with AppleScript I can catch the
exception and provide for a contingency; such as saving data to yet
another mounted volume.  Or even have it mount a remote volume; then
save.  The possibilities are only limited by your imagination.

Of course, AppleScript _does_ provide a way of communication with programs
at a higher level; that was it's design philosophy; it's very reason for
being! :)  But now you have all these different applications; each with...
wait!  each with almost the _identical_ interface!  Wow!  On further
investigation; the AppleScripter notices that scriptable apps follow the
Apple Event Object Model which defines a uniform interface; and several
standardized event suites that allow scripters to learn only once how to
deal with certain types of data.  Such as the Text suite, the Database
suite, the Graphics suite, etc...

And AppleScript is _much_ more than a simple event-recorder system!  Check
out the book "AppleScript Language Guide English Dialect", available at
many fine bookstores.

Please do read about it; you might be surprised!  If you haven't used it,
how do you know how easy it really is?  I've never developed scripts in
the Bourne Shell, so I have no comment.  For one thing, the control is
really at a high level; and the horde of supporting apps _is_ there!

Yes, I think the same think about other OSes as well, but you seem to not
know about MacOS very much.  On MacOS I _really_ don't have to worry about
whether the system has the tools installed.  And I can _write_ a script to
check if any needed additional extensions are available that the user may
have disabled, and inform them that my script would probably run better if
the re-enabled the desired ones.

One thing the Mac shows, the simple presence of a mouse and windows does
_NOT_ make for a good UI.  The Mac demonstrates by _example_ that many
other components are required; and I'm left wondering why other OSes don't
take the hint!

Of course the mere existence of a scripting mechanism does not make for an
effective method for automating software; this the AppleEvent registry and
standard suites; these _do_!

Please check out your facts before posting.

On an equal size disk with equal amount of data, the Macintosh find utility
will complete considerably faster than the UNIX find (15 seconds for an
exact name match on a Quadra 700 with a 1 GB HD as compared to 50 seconds
on a SGI Indigo with a 1 GB HD).

Also not true. The current version of SimpleText allows you to change
font, fontsize and style (bold, italic, underline etc).

It seems that your experience with the Macintosh is limited to
a Macintosh Plus running System 6?

Never takes more than 5 seconds on my machine, and I have three hard drives

You think Find File and SimpleText will consume 48 megs of RAM?  What are you
smoking? :)

In what way is it difficult to interpret the results of a find file command?

Yeah, now your 386 with 8 megs of RAM and 200 users has just run out of swap
space, and it locks (technically it hasn't crashed, but it's now unusable for
all practical purposes since the OS is busy scrambling to dump pages; sure
would have been nicer if it had just said "out of memory" and continued to
perform all other tasks at a reasonable speed).  Yes, I have seen this happen
on a friend's 386 Linux box...

Prior to system 7.5, the built in find command in the finder could only search
for one thing at a time.  Under 7.5, Find File can match based on multiple
criteria during a single search; you can match by dates, name,
size, creator/type codes, file locked/unlocked flags, and I'm pretty sure it
will do file contents as well.

What? Nonsense. The command keeps on going. If you think this then
you're just clueless, at least w.r.t. the Mac.

I just can't believe how many people are willing to defend the unix
'find' utility. It's terrible, face it. The 'find' in System 7.5 is
waaaaaay better, and there's just not much you can do about it.

Even other CLI-based operating systems  at least have things that mean
'this and all subdirectories'. And don't get me started on the dozen or
so ways to escape metacharaters, several of which are in use in the
find command alone.

Yeah, that's it. Try actually running that command with escaped braces,
and when you figure out what's wrong with THAT, try again. (Hint: if
you run that command with escaped braces, you should type something
into stdin.) Of course, this just supports my argument that even
experienced users of 'find' find it difficult, and highly inefficient.

I love it when people spout the merits of 'find' as an example of the
power of unix. Almost always they post some little find command that
has some subtle problem.

What would the output of the above command look like, and why do you
suppose its not very useful?

There is nothing wrong with that find command. If there are problems,
chances are you are running some broken old shell (e.g.  csh).  In the
Bourne shell or GNU Bash, there aren't any problems with the above.
The {} does not need to be escaped.

I guess that does it, then.  All of us unix guys are out, macs are better
than any unix box. (yeah right) What was it Linus said about macs?
Something about them having memory management that would frighten very
small children.  I use the find command and find :) no problems with it,
and dont care to wait the time required, which is not too long generally
(and yes my disks are bigger than a few meg too).

You could be right, the macs might be great at finds.  I hope to never
know though.

I believe the problem he refers to is the fact that grep will return
the lines in each file it find, but won't list the file names
anywhere.  Of course this might be what he wanted, but...

find / -name foo -ctime 3 -type f -exec grep -l blah {} \;

is probably what he wanted.  Of course this isn't an error with find
syntax, but with grep syntax...

200 users on a 386 with 8 MB of RAM... even if this reported figure is off by
an order of magnitude, and it's actually 20 users on that system... how can
you complain about such an OS?  I've got $80K worth of superserver sitting
downstairs that's starting to burst at the seams with just shy of 300 users
on it... the OS alone costs nearly $15K more, but I could theoretically
replace it with Linux for... $0!  (yes, yes, I know I'd lose the cost savings
instantly on software purchases & hardware modifications, gimme a break I'm
trying to make a point here).

And forgive me for having clipped too much up there... but wasn't the original
comparison of a single-user MAC box to this hypothetical 200-user Linux box?

That's all I want to say, especially considering how many .advocacy groups
are reading this thread :)

I'd say that the MacOS is a much more embarrasing example of bad programming.
At least "find" is inconspicuous, and it works.

No, actually, some unix guy said that the Mac couldn't handle a search on
a multigigabyte database for records matching three criteria.  I said
that the Mac could do much better than three criteria on a multigigabyte
database, as is easily demonstrated by it's "find" command.

And how is the MacOS's "find" an example of bad programming?  Perhaps too

sys7.5's find on my Quadra (MC68LC040 25MHz)(both have about the same

Ooooooo.....big guy runs unix and we all cower at his feet.  Get off it man.
Unix isnt the only OS in the world and for lot's of things it's not even
the best.  I use one of the fancier unix graphics workstations and for
anything other than 3d stuff a fast mac will eat it alive.

What's the problem?

Can your find command detect the presences of a custom as opposed to a

Drive access time is also a consideration for this analysis. But it is
important to note that in any search the number of records is the relevant
number to be benchmarking with. Do both drives have the same number of files?
(File size and drive size whould not matter for this). Also processor speed
and load are considerations, if either of the machines are running in
multi-user mode.

The only way a Mac could run faster would be if they had a better algorithm to
proform the search with. Since (as we all know) a linear search of elements is
O(n), and this is probly the worst search anyone would implement (unless they
were crazy _and_ stupid). To be more efficent, a find utility would have to
have a pre-existant data structure that enabled faster searches (Binary Search
Tree, Binomial Heap etc...), but since you are ususlly looking for substrings
(like all the .h files or something) these implementations may have mixed
results (fast on some types of searches, slow on others)

Also, unix find is much more powerful in that it can be used to execute
commands on large numbers of files, delete files, or do any number of useful
administrative tasks. (I'm unsure if Mac has the same capability)

The computers were all macs, then?
running what, A/UX? perhaps that particular variant of unix is
comparatively slow - I find that linux is startlingly fast compared
to say, msdos with respect to filesystem operations. I guess we'll
have to wait for macLinux to do a real mac-vs-unix comparison on
identical hardware....

Speed aside, I really like the UNIX find command because it is
able to hand off more processing to other commands via the -exec
option.  This capability alone is worth it whenever I'm on a UNIX
system.  And while I'm developing programs, I can't live without
it.  Notice you're not limited to just grepping stuff, but you
also can delete items, copy them somewhere else, whatever.  If
the Macintosh's find command has an "execute" option, it would be
great!

Finally, a UNIX user who actually wants to know something rather than
claim that his system can do what the mac cannot.

Let me tell you why the mac (System 7.5) has by far the most powerful and
simplest file finding utility bar none!

1. You can search for files based on any combination of the following:
NAME (search for a name that contains, starts with, ends with, is, is not
OR doesn't contain a string)
SIZE (search for smaller than or larger than a given size)
KIND (is or is not an alias, application, clipping file, document, folder,
font, letter, sound or stationary)
LABEL (is or is not one of any of the predefined labels allowed through
the finder)
DATE CREATED (is, is before, is after, is not, is within n days of, is
within n weeks of, is within n months of a certain date)
DATE MODIFIED (same paramaters as above for date created)
VERSION (is or is not a value you type in)
COMMENTS (contain or do not contain the string you type in [for those
unfamiliar, you can add extremely long comments to your files through the
finder])
LOCK ATTRIBUTE (is locked or unlocked)
FOLDER ATTRIBUTE (is or is not empty, shared or mounted)
FILE TYPE (is or is not - The file type created by an application)
CREATOR (is or is not - any application)
CONTENTS (contain or do  not contain any string)
CUSTOM ICON (is present or not present)
or
VISIBILITY (is visible or Invisible)

But wait there's more.  In unix this would require you memorizing a
different switch for each of the above.  On the mac you simply click the
more choices button and choose which attribute you want to add to your
criteria from the pop-up menu.

But wait there's more.  Say you don't know what the creator or file type
code is of your program.  No problem, choose creator or file type and drag
that kind of a file into the search field.  The MAC fills it in for you.
In fact if I had all of the choices above open and dragged a file into the
find dialog all the fields including name, version, etc would
automatically fit in.

But wait, there's more.  Off course you can cut and paste the text in from
any application.

But wait, there's one more for Unix lovers.  In System 7.5, thanks to the
thread manager, not only does find file run in the background, it searches
different volumes (disks) simultaneously.

But wait, there's more.  Not only does it find the files, it presents them
for you in window list in which you can:  Double click on the files to
launch them, drag them onto an application you want to run them, drag them
to the trash or drag them into any folder on your system.  Clicking on a
file will also present you with its location in the bottom part of the
window, of which you can double click on any parent folder to open it in
the finder.

PS, unlike many other claim you see on USENET, I have not exaggerated a
single feature of this fast and easy to use utility.  Have someone who
really knows how to use a mac show it to you sometime. I think its worth
the cost of upgrading to system 7.5 on its own.

with Unix find you can do a million more things with  "-exec" and the
other shell tools.  Of course, it's not as draggy adn clicky.

Here you go:
from the finder hit command-f or choose find from either the apple menu or
the file menu:
In the top left pop-up menu (probably where it defaluted to "name") click
and choose "date modified" to the right of that choose "is within 1 week
of" and leave today's date as the default.
Then click on more choices and, holding down the option key, in the left
pop-up menu choose "contents" leave contain as the default modifier and
type "soliton.h" in the text field to the right.

Now either click on the find button or hit enter.

Well, I seem to be able to do whatever I want to while finding all files
containing 'soliton.h' and accessed within the last seven days, as is
evidenced by the fact that I'm posting this right now, and opened up a
new text editor to do it in.

BTW, you should really try to be more polite when you post. Inconsiderate
language like you used in unquoted portions of your post will really win
you no friends, and fewer converts to your point of view.

The thing is, you have to move and click on them, they can't be piped
to another program, or otherwise handled automatically by the machine.
While you would have to sit at the box waiting for the find to get
done, I could go get my Mt. Dew.  find on most unix platforms does
need a bit of work tho.

I would say without a doubt that the MAC interface is considerably
easier for novice users to use, but most nixes, wether in GUI or CLI
have a bit more power behind them do to easy interoperability of the
various utilities and the shell languages.

No the Macintosh had over 13500 files and 2000 directories while the SGI
had 25700 files+directories (I didn't bother to count them separately).

Since I am all for fair benchmarks I increased the number of files+folders
to 21500 (ran out of disk...) on the Macintosh and the find command took
15-16 seconds to search the disk.

Yes it has.

:
: Applescript it. Record your file actions once, tack on the execution
: time, and save the applet.

   I know that now that the Mac finally has a scripting mechanism that every
Mac zealot is going to be convinced that it is the answer to the world's
problems, but it isn't that easy.  Us Amigaphiles thought the same way
five or six years ago when AREXX first showed up.  We were wrong.

   Yes, if you can record, edit, and playback system events, you can automate
programs to an extent, but it's a low-level, fiddly, error-prone sort of thing.
Suppose, for example, that in the middle of processing you fill up the
disk, and up pops a "DISK FULL" dialog box.  What will your recorded stream
of events do now?  At best it will stop half-done.  A robust script that
will handle unexpected conditions is next to impossible.

   Or, of course, you can provide a way of communication with programs at
a higher level, the way Arexx does.  Arexx allows you to call application-
defined routines, that have application-defined behaviors.  But now you
have all these different applications, each with its own set of Arexx
commands.  It's a _LOT_ of work learning these interfaces.  What you
need isn't just Arexx-aware apps, but a standard set of Arexx commands,
so that saving a file has the same syntax in every application.  But
even with the lack of standardization among Arexx interfaces, you're
still way ahead of a simple event-recorder system.

   Now, I don't know much about AppleScript.  But from what I do know,
it makes things possible, it doesn't make things easy.  I'd be astounded
if it was as easy to develop quality scripts as it is in Bourne Shell.
For one thing, the control is at too low a level, and for another, the
horde of supporting apps isn't there.

   As a simple example, how do you, on the Mac, configure a script to
execute every morning at 3:00?  Does it require a third-party or share-ware
utility?  How many such utilities are there?  How many Mac's have them
running?  Have you ever used one?  Are you certain that the one you've
configured will still be running to start that job next February 13th,
even if you've forgotten that it was there?

   I've seen cron-like utilities for Windows, OS/2, the Amiga, etc., by
the dozen,  It's only on Unix that I know that there will always be one
there, and that it will always be running.  Similarly, I know that any
of dozens or hundreds of special-purpose utilities will be there, be it
the bc calculator, or the m4 text-preprocessor, or cut, frm, whatever.
I can just throw together a script on Unix and know that there is this
rich set of resources to take advantage of.  On any other OS, I have
to worry about whether the system has the tools installed.  Sure, _I_
always add awk, grep, etc., to a DOS machine, but I can't write a script
that assumes they are available, unless I provide them myself, which
gets into distribution size, licensing issues, and no end of hassles.


    One thing the Mac shows, the simple presence of a mouse and windows
does _NOT_ make for a good UI.  There is a lot of work that went into
the Mac's interface beyond mouse-drivers and windowing functions.  Similarly,
the mere existence of a scripting mechanism does not make for an effective
method for automating software.  MsDOS .BAT files should prove that,
Apple has made a necessary start, but it doesn't match Unix, or even the
Amiga, by a long shot.

The file command is useful for typing untyped files, but it does not
replace a good typed filesystem:

indigo 13% echo "GIF files don't look like this" > bar
indigo 15% file bar
bar:            GIF image  (0x656c x 0x2073)

Magic indeed! ;-)

You don't have to, just run that test yourself. I find that an SGI computer
with faster HDs takes slightly more than three times longer to complete the
find command.

No. But I just search for all files modified since yesterday, and it ran
in 14 seconds on a Macintosh Quadra with 21500 files and directories.
You can easily do a similar find on (part of) your favourite UNIX
filesystem.

find has a rather un-unixy way of handling its command line parameters
(especially the -exec one seems like a bit of a kludge). As to what is
wrong.... there is a "-l /dev/null" missing between the "grep" and the "{}".
It still is a very inefficient way of doing stuff (starting up "grep" for
every single file). Not to mention that the "-ctime" argument should be
qulified with "-3" or "+3" (don't remember what actually was asked for).
So better would be

find / -name foo -ctime +3 -type f -print | xargs grep -l /dev/null

>As to your claim about '10 times faster than the Mac:

With my version, it most probably is. Not exactly because the find command
is superior, but unix' disk handling in general tends to be faster.

It all makes some kind of sense.... sure, it doesn't have nice buttons and
checkboxes, but it doesn't require you to mess around with a mouse, either.
And it's always easy to write a GUI frontend to a CLI command, and pretty
hard the other way around.

It's functionality, however, is great.
