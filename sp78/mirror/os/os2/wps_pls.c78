 Here we go. What's your definition of a better dos? One with true pre-emptive
capabilities, even tho it's missing some gadgets, or one with lots of gadgets, that
really messes up the tasker if it's fired up.

 Why get rid of the one system everyone here is sure is going to work? Don't blame
windows on dos. Don't blame bloated MM systems on dos. Don't blame lack of apps
on dos, and by all means, don't blame dos for limitations. If someone improved on
dos' threading capabilities, and improved it's 32 bit capabilities, then I'm sure that
dos would be around for alot longer than windows9* with everything built in. Since
the requirements for dos apps are minimal(HW) in comparison, why not concentrate on
doing something more with the best system going right now. BTW, as warp continues
to run dos apps, and is able to link them under the gui, who can complain about the
lack of apps for os/2? Not windows apps, either, but dos apps themselves, which are
inherintly alot more stable.
>

 The point I'm trying to make is, who want's a MAc copy? Or an NT copy? I'd rather
use a system that will task anything I feed it, but hate gui's and Icon's and pretty
little frilly dealies that get me really pissed! That's why there are shell replacements
in Os/2, and if you think Ii run the wps, you're nuts. I'd gladly trade every single PM
app I have for a decent text based version of said same. They use less mem, and are
faster and more stable than any type of giu interface I've ever used. Pine could be ported
to os/2, instead of this I've got loads of features IBM IAK thing, and so could lynx. You
want fast and lean WWW. Go text mode, and it'll cook. I also run dos apps, and thee's no
problems at all with the tasker. I've even got references in the redbook to prove it. Alot
more can be done with os/2 and current apps than win95, mac, or any other system will,
and runs unix apps too, if they're ported to it. So there. I've said it. I'm out.

The 'trash can' and OS/2's undelete perform similar but differnt functions.

OS/2's undelete provides a fixed sized directory to store deleted files and
removes them in a fifo order. A large (10-20MB) undelete directory can be
a 'lifesaver'. You can often recover a file even after months have gone by.

The 'trash can' is just another folder that you move files to before you
delete them. The same effect can be done in OS/2 by creating a template
of a folder labeled 'trash' with a trash can icon. All you have to then is to:

1) Drag of a new 'trash can' and put files in it you want to be deleted.

2) When you want to empty the trash you just delete the 'trash can'.

3) You can either drag off another 'trash can' or write a REXX script to
   automaticly create you another one.

Remember, though, that Windows (whether 3.1.1 or '95) is just a shell sit-
ting on top of DOS, and that the "real" file names are still 8+3.  I believe
that when you enter in a long name from Windows, the name is hashed in some
way to a 8+3 name (truncated, I'd guess, maybe with some characters changed
if there's a conflict between two 8+3 names.)  A kludge, IMO.

This is the "Clipping Extension" thing.  Rather convenient, certainly more
so than the Mac Clipboard (which only holds one thing.)

According to the PC World paean^H^H^H^H^Hreview, if you move the original
item, a Windows "Shortcut" will get lost.  Real stupid--aliases on the Mac
don't usually get lost.

Would this be anything like the "Wizards" in Micro$loth apps like "Chart-
Wizard"?  If so, the idea is OK, but should be very, very optional.  Walk-
ing through umpteen dialog boxes is not my way of doing things.

I should mention a few things (quoted from PC World:)
Size of WordPad - 1.4 meg (cf. Write at 282 K.)  I'm sure that MacWrite is
ten times as functional as WordPad, and at the same size.
Size of HyperTerminal - 512 K
Size of Paint - 1.3 meg.
Bloat, bloat, bloat.
Is there anything here which isn't in ClarisWorks, even a braindead version
like 2.1?  Not really.  ClarisWorks comes with Performas, if I'm not mis-
taken; it should come with all Macs.

I do _not_ like this.  In the case of Word 6 (which I've had to endure on
public Macs), this gives an excuse for Micro$loth to pack excess (and I mean
_excess_) dialogs into one window, by means of tabbed cards.  Wading through
half-a-dozen dialog windows just to change one thing is horribly inefficient.
(Features and customizability are nice, but M$ just doesn't know where to
stop.  It's like having a typewriter with a thousand keys.)

Win '95 got rid of two methods of scripting/recording macros; now, if I
understand correctly, one must needs resort to writing DOS batch files.  ??
This doesn't make any sense to me at all--wasn't the whole idea to _hide_
DOS?
My brother, who gravitated towards PeeCees as I gravitated towards Macs
(we're still on speaking terms :), once said to me, "The problem with M$
is that they never admit that they made a mistake.  So they're hiding DOS,
burying it deep and dark, but it wouldn't ever cross their minds to get
_rid_ of it."

As I see it, except for speed, compactness, and originality, Micro$oft's
copy of MacOS is nearly perfect.

Men you have got to be kidding me. It looks like you are hooked on this so
called PC WORLDS stupid test. This is nothing but a bunch of BS. If you think
this is true then you are mistaking. Sorry i don't think so. This all sounds
to me like you have not seen/used W95. You just believe what these OS/2
moron's and magazine says.
FYI when you create a shortcut, You can rename the actual file and rename the
directory and to make things even worse move that the entire directory where
executable is to another directory and GUESS what W95 will find the actuall
file and run it. Thank you. Do the test and apologize to this news group. I
don't recall OS/2 crap being able to do this.

How is HyperAccess Lite "much better" than HyperTerminal?  As far as I
can tell, they both suck, with HyperAccess Lite sucking the most, because
of its mediocre VT-100 emulation.

For OS/2, on the other hand, it catches all your deletes.  Win95 only catches
deletes that you do from the GUI.

   Actually, Shadows and Aliases are the stronger of the two while Shortcuts
are the weak.  The main weakness in a shortcut is that if you rename the
executable it points to, he shortcut no longer works.
   You're thinking of Shadows in OS/2 as week is a misjudgement, in my opinion.
Shadows are simply "shortcuts" to a real icon - nothing more or less.  It acts
just like the icon it points to, and takes up little to no harddrive space.  If you
need something similiar but more powerful, you can create a new icon for the
item instead of a shadow -- change all the properties you want for it, etc.

    This is stupid for them to have in the Top35. Windows 95 comes with less
than Windows/DOS did.  Hover replaces Hearts/Solitaire/Minesweeper, the
Wordpad replaces Write/Notepad, etc.   I'd say their about eqal (since many
of the apps equal to several of the apps taht came with Windows/Dos), and
thus being nothing more than the same, its stupid to have it in the Top35.

486-66 w/2X CDROM about 15 seconds to come up with the autoplay screen after

   This is also silly.  Right now, I'd say that NT has a slight advantage in
crash protection over OS/2 (multiple messaging Q's -- OS/2 should have this
in its next upgrade)... And, compared to OS/2 or NT, Win95's crash protection
is far lacking.  Silly that MS could develop so good a crash protection (NT) and
then put out so poor of one (95).

   There is a similiar feature in OS/2, though the exact name of it escapes me.
It puts up "thumbnails" of your objects in a folder -- its in the Bonus Pack.
(Correct me if I'm wrong on this -- I experimented with this feature on the

  Wrong.  Have you even used Windows 95?   For your information, I have it on
my system.  It is not a beta.  It is not a build.  It is "the" Windows 95 that will
be in stores on Aug 24th.

   I created a shortcut.  I renamed the filename through DOS.  I tried to run
the shortcut.  Win95 couldn't find the file.
   I then, through DOS, renamed it back to original.  The shortcut worked.
   Then, through Windows Explorer, I renamed the filename.
   The shortcut did not work.

   Thus:  You, sir, are very wrong.  The only way this would work would
be moving a file to another directory (not renaming the filename) and the
other directory being in the Path statement.  Under those circumstances, you could
"move" the file.

I think this is an unfair dig at Win95.  The wizards are actualy only a few
steps most of the time and are very, very similar to the upcoming Apple Assist
thingie on Copland.  They are completely integrated with the hlep system and
for the average user more of a learning tool than an obfuscation.  IMHO that
this is a realy handy feature, and well worth having or Mac and Windows both
wouldn't be palanning to do it.

I think you missed the point of this post here.  The guy is being very fair

Again, you are missing the point in favour of a blanket OS/2 advertisement.
The point is the way this information is organized and accessible through the

This is why the original poster does not talk about Connect so much, becaue
tyou are totaly wrong to say the price is the same.  Warp Connect is closer to
Windows NT in price than it is to Win95.  You can order a copy of Win95 today

I would like to point out that OS/2's "find" command requires the user know
someting about "dos wild-card" characters, as opposed to Win95 or Mac where
you can either use wildcards, or simply type a reasonable facimile of the word
or phrase you are searching for and get an itemised "hit-sensitive" list.
IMHO that this is much more robust than OS/2's way.

Again, I would like to point out that Win95's help system is more interactive
than Apple Guide, sort of like what Apple Guide will be in it's next
incarnation as "Apple Assist" in the Copland system.  The difference is that
Win95 is here today.

Win95.

around at work looking for goodies in the trash (Yuk!) although I occaisionaly
go into the recycle bin and take paper out to re-use it.

Lets see. Its 7:04am in the morning and i just logged on to See if any one
read the message and ofcourse you did.
  FYI i tried what you said and guess what it worked FINE. I even went
to DOS and renamed the *.exe file and ran the Shortcut and Guess what. It
found it and ran it.
  Just to let you know i used a 32-bit graphic software called Polyview.
I put it in a directory called "graphic software". I opend up a dos section
and renamed it it to "p.exe". went into Windows and cliked on the shortcut
icon and it found it and ran.

  This leads me to believe that you don't even have W95 that you claim
you have. You just want to spread another FUD.

Nope. You got this one wrong. The "real file name" you mentioned is only
available to the old applications which does not support long file name.
For all other Windows 95 applications, the file name is indeed 255 characters

But Wizard is NOT for people like you. It is for the real novices. Those

Oh, but don't you see the beauty of this?

You see, once you become used to the new approach (or if a new computer
user, this is the only way you know) then all other interfaces seem
strange and awkward.  If you try something else (OS/2 or Mac) you will
immediately give up and declare the interface "awkward" and never
leave Windows again.

Brilliant...

Hi Jeremy:

I don't think he 'missed the point' or that he flooded every point with 'OS/2
propoganda'.  Some of the things he may have gone a bit far with, but it
wasn't *that* excessive.  If you think any of it was overly excessive, please
do try to remember that this is OS2.ADVOCACY.  A lot of M$ people are very
quick to forget this rather "trivial" point: this is not comp.os.totally.
unbiased.reviews.of.every.operating.system.in.the.entire.world.

His point was that microsoft didn't add some great new capability that hadn't
existed before - anybody can add any item to virtually any system list/menu.
All M$ did was make this more apparent than to the typical OS/2 user.  IBM
seems to think that people will take the time to learn every facet of their
OS, as though they were being taught as part of their job training, or some-
thing, while M$ chooses to throw it in your face, and/or force you to use it.

Which is the worse evil; 'hiding' (not making totally apparent without actually
having to learn) informtaion, or forcing you do use something, with no
alternatives or choices?

I have to agree here.  OS/2's 'system' folder can be cumbersome or awkward,
especially compared to the Mac.

Agreed.  OS/2 really doesn't have this ability built-in.  If you send a bunch
of jobs to your printer (or other device) you can use the media viewer to see
what it'll look like, as well as some other formats, but there really isn't a
'generic' one ... persoanlly, I'd just like to have a 'list' type clone.

Shadow is weak because it doesn't work across network, and it is only a

OS/2 shadow), embedded link in a mail, pointer to a file in a network, pointer
to a file in MSN (which also automatically call MSN for you if you click on it),

Now I wonder whether you really use Windows 95. Hearts/Solitaire/Minesweeper

Not true. This is always a case, whenever a feature implemented on Windows 95
which does not exists for OS/2 - it is NOT important. This feature is more
important to many people than, say the ability to customize folder's color.
The point is: you don't have to install CD software. Don't have to type that
stupid "setup" or "run" or figure where is the CD-ROM drive. It just run.
You are not the only power user. We have many software engineers too who uses
OS from Windows to UNIX and we agreed it is cool.

I know you missed the point!!!!  The writer of this was a mac user who also

Neither does Windows 3.1.  Make the comparison between like products.  All

This is flatly false.  I have program objects whose executable files and
directories are on a network -- they can be shadowed just like any other
program object.  You may have been thinking of file objects, but if so
you are still totally incorrect, since file and directory objects that
refer to network files and directories can also be shadowed,
just as a rational person would expect.

Let's see. I'm looking at the file PARSE.EXE in My Computer now, using Windows
95 Build 490. Right click on it and select Properties. Wow! Look at that! I
see a Create Time&Date, A Modified Time&Date, and an Accessed Time&Date! I
didn't think Win95 could do that! :-)

I will grant you that HPFS is superior to VFAT. But VFAT is backwards
compatible and it does a great job at providing many of the features of HPFS,
like long file names and all those great time&date things.

   Wrong and a little right.  Notepad is still there, but Hearts/Sol and Minesweeper
are not.  I have actual Windows 95, not a beta.  I installed to Win32 directory,
not windows directory (Still keep my DOS+Windows compatability).  The
files for Solitaire, Hearts, Minesweeper are not there.  There is not install for them
in the Add/Remove.  As I said, they are left out.  As I also said, Hover more than
makes up for them (though I think Hover is stupid and actually, sometimes, played
Hearts).

     You make me laugh.  Saying that I detest it simply because OS/2 doesn't have
it.  That's stupid.  I think its stupid that OS/2 doesn't come with a "file manager"
type file manager -- I hate the folders opening into other folders style (though
much easier for beginners).  I realize that FM/2 is out there that does this, but
I'd like OS/2 to COME with it.
     I don't pick on a point just to advocate any operating system.  I'm about to
buy another harddrive for the sole reason of being able to run BOTH OS/2 and
Win95 now that I have the *real* thing with both.
     I don't like Autoplay -- it slows me down.  I also like shortcut keys, which
speed me up -- and there are more of them in Windows than OS/2 (that i've
found for OS/2, at least).   I already noted that Autoplay is nice for some people,
but for people who want to quickly do what they are doing, it can be annoying.

And I have build 347.  What Win-95 looks for is the filename.  If that
is changed, it can't find the file, even if that file is in the same
directory.  This might have something to do with the FAT system...the
Mac file system is more robust in this area.  I have no working
knowlege of HPFS and will not discuss it.

I tried the same test, and it did work, but in my earlier post, using
a simple data file (test.txt ->  tset.doc)  did not.

Just a quick comment here.  I find it amusing to hear people debate about
the merit of bundled apps.  Do you know the real reason they were included?

Tools to test the basic functionality of the OS for tech support.  "Word
Perfect 6 won't print?  Let's try it in Write."  "Procomm won't recognize
your modem?  Let's open terminal.."  It amazes me how many people try to
use paintbrush for graphics work..

Well, at this point, the Mac *is* my favorite of the three, although it's
closer than you might think. But I don't see how that precludes me from trying
to use each OS to the best of its abilities and then discussing that. That's
what my post attempted to do. Further, I answered you in another post, and
explaned that I am, in fact, aware of what you pointed out. I still don't
think it's as good as going to a single item (either Apple or Start).

As I said in my original post, it doesn't matter to me who came up with a
feature first. Why is that so important? In terms of a GUI, the Mac came up
with most of these first. And yet many (most?) of these ideas were "borrowed"
from others, so it could be (and has been) claimed that even the Mac didn't
have them first. It matters not one whit to me. I'm concerned with what's
there now, not where it came from.

And your remarks are not biased Thye Chean? In another post you posted false
information claiming OS/2 Shadows didn't work across networks. Why would you
post that information unless you were sure ? The only reason I can think of
is to pass FUD. Under VFAT the "real file name" is still 8.3, anyway FAT is
a horrendous file system and Microsoft should have buried it.

Ok, I think we need to get this solved once and for all.  Please, all
you Win95 users out there try this and reply what happens on your
system.  Everybody seems to have differing opinions about what is
supposed to happen.  Take any file, in any directory and make a
shortcut to it.  Open up a dos window, and rename the file.  Move the
file to another directory on the same drive, and then rename the file
to another name.  Go back to the shortcut and see if it is still
attached.  If it isn't, does it "find" the new file.  Please try this
by changing just the filename, just the extention, and both.  Does it
do the same thing for all three tests?  Under OS/2, it works perfectly
fine.  It works even if you use a DOS window, OS/2 window or using the
WPS.  It also works with DOS directory programs such as X-Tree.  So,
try it out, and reply with your findings, I would like to know on how
many people's computers it works or doesn't work on.  Please state
your build version, and any other pertinent information.  I hope this
will put an end to this debate once and for all.

Chill, dude.  He got them backwards is all.

I'm doing this from an article I read some time ago, since I haven't yet
played with shortcuts on Win95.

As I recall, all files on a Win95 hard drive have a stamp within them
which contains the precise millisecond of their creation.  A shortcut
refers not to a filename, but to that timestamp.  Thus, the original
can move and be renamed all you want, with no troubles.  I hope they've
tested the results of two objects having an identical timestamp, but the
odds of that are vanishingly small.

On the Mac, the alias refers to the full path name.  (Same with UNIX links.
I think that shadows on OS/2 also do this.)  Thus, moving the original
breaks the alias.  There are shareware utilities that make this easier
to fix, and there is a "Find Original" button in the Get Info box which
can be useful, but the Mac method has obvious weaknesses compared to
the Win95 version.  Of course, I've had very few problems with the Mac
method, and have been using it for years, but that does not mean that
the Mac method is as good.  In this case, it's not.

    Care to explain how a "Direct cable connexion" (tm) :-} is faster than
a two-node Localtalk network?
    AFAIK, AppleTalk has a theoretical throughput of 230KBits/sec, whereas
a modem port (which I assume will be used by this feature) is only
57.6KBits/sec.

    Also, why wouldn't a "Direct cable connexion" not be a (albeit crude)
network?

Nope. Who cares. In the Windows 95, whenever you are in the GUI or command

is non-relevant.

Hey, this attitude is bad. If my other post is wrong, please correct me. I

bias shows again.

What happens when you duplicate a file, or option-drag a file to copy it
instead of moving it?  Is the creation timestamp the same on the copies,
or not?  If it is the same, the odds of an identical creation timestamp
can be quite large.

Baloney.  Stick to what you know.  Every Macintosh file can be given a
unique file ID that sticks to the file even when it is moved to other
locations on disk.  Macintosh aliases primarily use this file ID
mechanism, although they also store information about the file's path,
volume, folder etc to track down the appropriate file in case the original
file has been deleted.

If you've *ever* worked with aliases on the Mac, you'd know that moving
the original file does *not* break the alias.  Neither does renaming any
folder in the file's path, renaming the volume, moving any folder in the
file's path, etc.  In addition, the MacOS will also find the appropriate
file if you duplicate the original, delete the original, and then rename
the copy to the same name as the original.

Jeremy, what is it about Apple Guide that you think is less interactive
than Win '95s help system?  Apple Guide gives you the ability to quickly
search for help in several different ways, including some ways not
provided by most Windows programs.  In addition, Apple Guide can step you
through procedures, actually "showing" you what to do.  In addition, Apple
Guide can automatically *do* those procedures for you.  How much more
interactive can you get?

Not all apps take advantage of all these features of AppleGuide; then
again, not all Windows apps take advantage of all the features of the
current WinHelp, so we'll probably have a long wait for these forms of
interaction to be generally supported in Win '95 Help as well.

I'm not sure where the poster received that impression.  What

Amen.  The point is:  If you've never used a multi-button mouse before
Macintosh, you won't miss it, and it will be easier to use.
The last thing in the world Apple will ever do is add a multiple-button
mouse.  Mac people don't *care*.

Properly-implemented preemptive multitasking is great.  No one denys that.
What makes you think you'll have it in Windoze '95?  And we can perform
other tasks while programming (and !compiling!) under Macintosh >and< OS/2.
I realize you can't do that under Windoze 3.1 because of the instability,
but you shouldn't assume that stable background tasks require preemption.

You don't quite get it, though:  Windoze 95 is less perfect than Macintosh
or OS/2.  If you have to use a PC, get OS/2.  If you have a choice, go
Macintosh.  Either one will serve your needs better than Windoze 95.  And
still be more reliable.

The main differences here relate to the OO support. Whereas moving an object
from one volume to another in Win95 will break any shortcuts to that object,
in OS/2 the shadows remain linked. This is a trivial example of an important
difference between the two. OS/2's object support is at least 2 years
ahead of anyting Microsoft has to offer (who *knows* what will be in Cairo....).

Shortcuts are more like crippled shadows......they are only valid on the one disk.

  Go ahead, run them.  They aren't going to be able to do
anything.  Win95 (in the GUI or out of it in SAM mode) will stop any disk
application from directly writing to the disk without using the proper
methods (ie: Win95s built in APIs or whatever for doing this kind of thing).

I don't know, Nathan!  I use AIX and OS/2 at work and MacOS at home.
I don't have enough experience with Win95 to tell you.  (I hope that
they retain the creation stamp no matter where it's copied, or their
shortcuts would presumably break.)

I know for a fact that if I change the name of my hard drive, every alias
except the one for the Control Panels folder is going to break.  I know
this because it is exactly what happened when I upgraded my Mac and changed
the name of the external drive.  I was running a 7.5 beta at the time, so
unless aliases were broken in the beta (didn't seem to be from daily use)
or were improved upon in 7.5.1, then there are still ways to lose the
link between alias and original on the Mac.

You are correct in the last sentence.  However, I have had many aliases
break on the Mac from moving and renaming files.  I wrote an AppleScript
when I upgraded my machine in order to change the path name stored in
every alias on my hard drive so that I didn't have to search for all the
aliases and change them manually.  Before I did that, they were broken.

I have a great respect for your knowledge of the Mac, after reading your
posts for some time, and I hope you responded so strongly because you
are having a bad day.  Further, I'll do some tests this weekend and see if
you are correct.  But please spare me the highhandedness.  I'd imagine
I've been working with Macs long enough to get the simple stuff right.

I was under the impression that internally, all new programs also use the
8.3 filenames.  They just display the new filenames in dialogs, and hash
them when they're typed in.

Of course, I could be wrong.

You are correct that most of the time it won't matter.  It'll matter a
lot in there is a problem with your disk that corrupts the extended
filename info, and your scripts depend on the extended filename info.

Nope. All new program uses the long file names. Your idea is just the
reverse. VFAT support long file names. But old program will not recognize
them. Thus a need for the old MS-DOS name (called alias I believe) for

Actually, WIn95 will protect itself from these programs. When you go
into SAM mode (or in a DOS window), if it detects an attempt to directly
access the disk, it will inform you that this is not allowed, and you
must type "LOCK" in order to allow the direct disk access, after warning
you that you could be wiping out all the LFNs.  So you will have to try
fairly hard to wipe out the LFNs - simply starting an old program won't
do it.

Also, there is a little application which can be used to change all the
LFNs to 8.3, and save the changes to a file, which can then be restored,
so if you just had to do something which would screw up all the LFNs,
you could use this utility to save a lot of headaches.

Note that if you go to install NT from in Win95, you must lock the drive
or the setup won't run - which is how I discovered all this.

Maybe it's a language barrier but in your other posts where you disagree with
someone do not sound very polite. Yes I have a bias against FAT and therefore
VFAT, it started years ago when a FAT table(yes I know it's redundant) imploded
on my drive and I lost all my data. I can't think of one redeeming feature
of this *rotten* file system. It should be dead and buried not hacked on to
increase it's life span.

OK, boys and girls. Get out this month's PC World, turn to pp. 90-91 and
follow along with me. We are going to review the "35 Top Features" of Windows
95 and compare them to the Mac and OS/2. This post is rather long, and is
*not* meant to start a flame war. I run Mac OS and OS/2 at home, and Windows
NT and OS/2 at work. Further, I run Windows For Workgroups at both locations.

Personally, I've looked forward to Win95 and am just interested in discussing
the "final" product's features, now that it's here (OK, OK, it's not actually
here yet, but MS has started their media campaign proclaiming 8/24 as the date
it will be available, so I think it's a done deal).

Before I continue, I thought I'd post a few notes, so you know the "rules"
under which I'm playing:

* I don't worship at the OS "out of the box" alter. That is, I'm not above
adding 3rd party software (free/shareware and commercial) to make my OS better
for me. I rate an OS as much by the apps for it as anything else, that goes
for utilities, too. This is why I have Now Utilities on my Mac, QwikSwitch on
my OS/2 box, and Norton Desktop on my WfW setup, along with many others.

* I'm running OS/2 Warp for Windows at work, with the FixPack 5 installed.
Also TCP/IP 2.0 with CSD and Netware Client 2.11. Internet access is through
the LAN. At home, I run Warp FullPack with the Internet Access Kit through a
local provider.

* I'm running System 7.1.2 on my Mac. For those of you who don't know, this is
the last release of 7.1 before 7.5 became available last October. Some of the
features I am now getting with 3rd-party utilities come standard on 7.5. I've
just never bothered to upgrade.

* I have *not* use Win95 extensively. I have read extensively on the subject,
however, and have had some "hands on" time on a friend's box. If I get
something wrong about Win95 (or the Mac and OS/2, for that matter) please
correct me, but don't flame (I just ignore flames).

* Because the Top 35 is a Windows 95 list, this discussion is probably
"biased" towards Win95. But I had to start somewhere. Besides, as you'll see,
many of the features are in all three OS'es.

* Finally, everything expressed below is IMHO. Any omissions are by mistake.
It is *not* my intention to decide which OS is "best", but rather to briefly
discuss each OS'es features, starting with the "35 Top Features" of Win95 as
proclaimed by PC World. I don't care who came up with a feature first,
except to the extent that I can claim to have used it and know whether it's
beneficial _for_me_ or not.

Let's get started with the Top 35:

1) Start Button: Mac users will recognize this as the Apple menu. Always
available, very customizable, I consider it a great feature of the Mac OS. I
look forward to having it on my Windows box. OS/2 has the Launchpad, which
isn't quite the same (it's biggest drawback is that it's not heirarchical) but
is also very good.

2) The Desktop: The Mac and OS/2 already have this. Again, it will be great to
have this on my Windows box.

3) Taskbar: This is very nice feature. It's customizable enough that just
about everyone can make it useful for them. Mac users can get an idea of what
it's like by running the Desktop Control Strip with any number of modules that
show an icon for every running app (which is what I do). OS/2 users could run
the Launchpad with small icons and place it at the bottom of the screen so
it's always visible to get some of the same effect (in conjunction with some
other options, OS/2 is very flexibile in this regard). The Taskbar can also
appraise the user of various status conditions, and control the environment
(sound volume, etc.). Again, on the Mac, the control strip does this. OS/2's
Launchpad does not.

4) My Computer: To be honest, I'm not sure *what* to make of this. It's at
once both good and bad, IMO. It lets you browse thorugh your directories, but
also contains info on your installed hardware. To that end, the Mac and OS/2
don't have anything like it. OS/2 could probably use it, but the Mac isn't as
hardware intensive (no IRQ's, DMA's, etc.) and probably doesn't need it.

5) Explorer: A "new" File Manager, it lets you browse heirarchically through
your directory tree (double-click folders to open them, etc.). You can click a
name and type to rename it. For Mac and OS/2 users, this is old hat. But
again, I'm glad to have it on Windows.

6) Find: A pretty robust Find command. IMO, all three OS'es now have very good
methods of finding files. This is good, as it's one of the last things I've
found a CLI better at. Not any more.

7) Help: It's hard for me to get worked up about this. The best help system
I've seen is AppleGuide when done right. Unfortunately, most manufacturers
don't do it right, so it remains to be seen how effective this new help will
be. It looks good, though.

8) Close, Minimize, Maximize: A separate button for each of these now. Mac
users have always had a single-click to close, so it's no big deal. My biggest
problem with the Close button is that it's on the right-hand side of the
window. This is a problem not only because I may accidentally click it instead
of Min or Max, but also because all these years of GUI'ing have taught me to
move the mouse to the left-hand corner to close. It's going to be hard to
unlearn that habit. OS/2 has the best "minimize" features, in that I can
choose to actually minimize the app, or minimize it to a viewer app, or I can
hide it altogether. The Mac doesn't min/max, rather, it "hides" an
application. What I like is that I have my Mac set to hide an application
automatically when I switch to another one. This way, I don't have to perform
two actions, just one.

9) Plug & Play: We all know this. The Mac's got it, Win95 will have it for new
hardware, and OS/2 doesn't yet.

10) Folders: Nothing new to the Mac or OS/2. Glad to see it in Windows.

11) Long File Names: Again, the Mac and OS/2 have this. But the Mac is limited
to 31 characters, while Win95 (and OS/2?) have a limit of 255. Time will tell
whether this 255 character limit will prove useful (I've never used that many
for OS/2). Still, the fewer restrictions, the better, so I'll give the nod to
both OS/2 and Win95 for extending the possibilities here.

12) Microsoft Exchange: This sounds similar to PowerTalk under System 7.5 on
the Mac. I don't know of anything in OS/2 like it.

13) The Microsoft Network: Their very own online service. Apple has eWorld,
which is very ho-hum. I expect MSN to be a lot better. One very nice thing
about MSN is its tight integration into the OS. You can create shortcuts to
places online. I think this is pretty cool. For OS/2, they don't have their
own online service, but their IAK gives great (and easy) internet access.
Their Web browser lets you drag-n-drop URL's, which is also pretty cool. I
think Netscape for Win95 will also allow this.

14) Drag And Drop: All three OS'es have this. The Mac's going so far as to let
me drag apps, files, or folders up to special menus on the menubar for
dropping. I can routinely move a file from the top level of the heirarchy down
to, say, the tenth without opening a single window!

15) Scraps: As desribed, this is identical to a feature on the Mac's System
7.5 whose name escapes me (Mac users chime in). I don't know of anything like
it in OS/2.

16) Shortcuts: Sounds like Aliases on the Mac and Shadows under OS/2. IMO,
OS/2 shadows are the weakest, in that they are strictly WPS items. On the Mac,
an alias is recognized *everywhere*, not just in the finder. For example, I
have a folder on my Mac and OS/2 desktops containing aliases/shadows to my
most commonly used directores. This makes it easy to get to them or copy/move
files there. However, I can also use the Mac's folder when in an application's
Open/Save dialog box, since the aliases are recognized. In OS/2 however, the
shadows do not appear anywhere but in the WPS. One advantage of Shadows,
however, is they are not files, but references in the OS/2 INI files. As such,
they take up no disk space whatsoever. I believe Win95's Shortcuts are more
like Aliases than Shadows. I hope so.

17) Right Mouse Button: Context sensitive menus when you right-click on an
object. I *love* this. It's one of the Mac OS'es biggest mistakes not
to adapt this eminently useful feature.

18) Properties: Gives you information on an object, much of which can be
changed. OS/2 has this as well. The closest thing the Mac has is the Get Info
command, which doesn't tell you enough, IMO. I use Get More Info, myself,
which helps quite a bit.

19) System Properties: According to PC World, this is where you "can display,
diagnose, and configure your system. You may find yourself digging around in
here more than you'd fancy." The Mac's Plug and Play generally makes such
"digging around" unnecessary. But OS/2 could probably use such a beast. It
appears to be one of those features you'll love when you need it, but hope
you'll never need it.

20) Registry: This is where all system and applications settings are kept
(i.e., no more INI files). Windows NT has this and I'm not sure whether I like
it better than text-based INI files or not.

21) Wizards: Special dialogs to walk you through the hard stuff. I think
they're kind of neat, myself. If only because they help bring a little ease to
the otherwise difficult (for most people) task of installing new hardware. It
remains to be seen whether they are helpful enough to make a difference (i.e.,
will someone who couldn't install something before be able to do so now?).
Still, I appreciate the effort thay made and genuinely hope it works.

22) New Utilities: A new Write (WordPad), Terminal (HyperTerminal) and Notepad
app. OS/2 comes with the BonusPack, though, and IBMWORKS and HyperAccess Lite
are much better than WordPad and HyperTerminal. The Mac comes with nothing to
speak of. The verdict: If your needs are relatively light, you can get by
with OS/2's BonusPack. For the Mac and Win 95, you'll need more than what's
included. Personally, I think third-party applications are in your future
for any of the three.

23) Recycle Bin: A very stupid name for what is essentially the Mac's Trash.
Place files there but they aren't actually deleted until you empty it. For
OS/2, you must turn on the undelete function to get files back you've deleted.
But this makes deleting files S-L-O-W!.

24) Briefcase: Allows synching of files, like between a portable and a desktop
machine. OS/2 doesn't come with anything like it. Mac PowerBooks include a
file synchor (sp?).

25) Network Neighborhood: A graphical way to browse and connect to servers on
the network. OS/2 also lets me connect via a nice graphical method. The Mac's
Chooser, by contrast, is weak.

26) Direct Cable Connection: This is between two computers. To my knowledge,
there is third-party software that will let you do this for both Macs and
OS/2. It means nothing to me having it built-in to the OS, but it might to
you.

27) Internet Connectivity: For Win95, this means only TCP/IP and Winsock. For
the Mac, this also means TCP/IP. In both bases, you must supply the apps. For
OS/2, however, this means not only TCP/IP, but a very nice set of apps. The
IAK is really a great thing, IMO, and the best part of the BonusPack.

28) Peer-To-Peer Networking: Actually, Windows has had this since WfW, so it
really isn't new. The Mac has had it even longer, since the original System 7
four (?) years ago. OS/2 has it now in Warp Connect, but that is more
expensive than the other two OS/2 "flavors".

29) Autoplay: For audio CD's, just pop it in and it plays. I have this on my
Mac and OS/2 as well. For non-Audio CD's, it might install itself or
automatically run the program. Non-audio CD's must be written to take
advantage of this, however. I don't know of such a feature on the Mac or OS/2.

30) Tab Dialogs: I'm not sure why this is touted as a Win95 feature. Many
Windows apps already have this. OS/2 has it as well. And so do some Mac
apps. It does help to condese the number of items one needs to open to get at
a feature, however, so it's nice that Win95 will use it system-wide. On the
Mac, it would probably help to cut down the number of separate control panels
needed, which would be useful.

31) Crash Protection: Hey, didn't IBM copyright that term? :-)  This of course
refers to the ever-popular and much bally-hooed Memory Protection. All kidding
aside, it's a great feature to have. My beta of America Online crashes pretty
frequently, but OS/2 just ignores it and moves on, It's great! The Mac doesn't
have this at all, and I can't wait for it to appear. As for Win95, it appears
that all apps (even 32-bit ones) will still share some core memory. It remains
to be seen whether this will really compromise its crash protection or not. I
remain hopeful that it will be quite good, but doubt it can be as good as
OS/2's.

32) Preemptive Multitasking: OS/2's is marvelous. Win95's really needs all
32-bit apps to shine, but is much better than the current Windows. The Mac
doesn't have it. Many Mac users think they don't need it, but I disagree. You
really have to have this feature for a while to appreciate it.

33) Quick View: A built-in file viewer. I like this feature, as it lets you
easily view files if you don't have the app, or maybe you do have the app but
don't want to wait for it to launch. It could use a few more viewers
(something I'm sure third-parties will rush in to supply). I don't know of a
general file viewer for OS/2. Mac users would be best served with Can Opener.

34) Resolution Switching: Lets you change video resolutions (screen size and
number of colors) "on the fly" (no need to reboot). The Mac can do this as
well. For OS/2, you have to reboot.

35) A Better DOS: New commands are available, such as start (like OS/2's?).
I'm sure DOS mavens will notice the difference, but I confess not to. I'm not
much of a command-line kind of guy. In OS/2, I use Yet Another OS/2 Shell and
am quite happy with it. On the Mac, I use a couple of different command lines
just to prove I can do it, but its not as practical there, given the longer
directory names (even with name completion).

Well, that's it. Please comment on anything you like.
