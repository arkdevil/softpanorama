It seems to me that all these claims of superior stability by Win95 beta testers
(not users - there are no users yet) is due to it being specifically designed to
run all the old crap programs with all the old brain-dead drivers on all the current
crap hardware.  A real operating system would reveal the sad marginal hardware
designs out there today.  If stuff were really designed to the standards it is
supposed to conform to, then any OS should have very little trouble with it.
Microsoft probably realises that the majority of users will not truly appreciate
having a real 32bit protected OS because it may refuse to run on their system
that was designed on the cheapest edge of compatibility with DOS/Win3.1.
Thus, Win95 is founded on a rehash of the DOS/Win combo for compatibility.
If it runs on more machines (it will) than OS/2, then by the new twisted logic,
everyone seems to believe this makes it a "better" OS.  This seems to redefine
"better".

Again, probably the most abused judgement of which one is "better".  I'm not
implying that finding it easier to use is wrong, but I find that many people
come away from the eye candy as if they were hypnotized and then say Win95
is better just because it "looks better".  They then typically spout a list of
"amazing" things that Win95 does, and every one of those things OS/2 has had
for a long time (long file names, more memory for DOS apps, etc.).

I agree.  Encarta looks impressive, but was hard to use and crashed before
I really got to do anything.

I also worry about the effect of the endless coverage of Win95 during its
development.  All those early promises were well reported and even if they
don't make it into the final release, many will not realize it.  Win95 wouldn't
have to do anything at this point except be just like Win3.1 but look a little
different for masses of people, led on by the promises, will run out and buy it.
The user count will skyrocket in mere months.  This will make developers drool
at such an expanding user base.  Nevermind if it takes a few months for most
of these people to figure out they got suckered, by then Microsoft will be claiming
victory and everyone will just accept that they will have to live with it just
like they do with Win3.1.

Again, this does not make it better.  I may make it "better" in the Win95
dictionary.

>>The fact is that the amount of windows 95 software will far exceed all
>>the OS/2 software :)
This will be initially because they will count all the Win3.1 apps as Win95
apps and say they have more than OS/2.  When at first they will really have
the same amount of apps.  Yes, there are many apps poised ad ready for release
as soon as Win95 ships.  This is becase developers won't give OS/2 a chance
since it does not have the market share that Windows has.  They refuse to
develop for OS/2 until there are more users, and the consumers refuse to
become users until the developers create more apps.  How the hell did we ever
get Windows apps then? How did we ever get DOS apps?  CP/M apps?  Hell,
why did anyone bother to write the first application ever if there weren't any
users?

Okay, rant mode off - sheilds up!

First, DIVE is more than comparable to WinG (whatever version),
it's superior.

And if you want to compare beta stuff (MS GDK 2.0), it's only
fair to compare to other beta stuff, like (IBM's GDK).  And since
both are not fully released yet, talking about them is a waste of
time.

Less of a problem compared to selling it to a non-existant user
base.  SDS found that selling OS/2 games is quite easy, they are
making more to be released this fall.

And people continue to do business with Microsquish, it's amazing.  Here is
a company practiving the melectronic equiv of "ethnic cleansing" and people
continue to throw money at them.  Here's a hint: If you continue to support
microsoft, they will continue to screw you at every opportunity.

My Hard drive is Micro-soft free, is yours?

That's interesting, I haven't run across an update from Dos 6.2 to dos 6.22
for under $45 dollars, certainly not on the net (not that I've looked
either).  Upgrading windows 3.0 to 3.1 was a $89 pricetag at the time, I
don't know if that upgrade is now free or not.

Hell, upgrading friom Dos 3.3 to Dos 5 (er 5.1 er 5.11 er 5.2) was not
free.

Microsoft pioneered the concept of charging you to make their software work
like they told you it would work inthe first place.

Yes....quite!  It's the same old FUD from Dale that som many of us got tired of
in FidoNet.  I and many others had enough and put him in the twit list....most
fitting I think.  Thankfully, my reader will allow it here as well.

Oh, and people are not allowed to read?  So, I new user doesn't know
the rules surrounding the STANDARD way of using wildcards.  (I call it
the standard if DOS/UNIX/WIN 3.1/OS/2 is using it)   Press the help
key, and click on name, and it explains how to use * and ?.  It's not
THAT complicated.  Plus, it gives you more control over what and where
to look for.

Ever heard of Galactic Civilizations for OS/2?  It is written solely
for OS/2, and it sold around 200,000 copies.  Also, I have seen DIVE
games (Doom) and WinG games (SimTower and ClockWerkx)  The two WinG
games are SOOOO slow.  In CLockWerkx all it moves is clock hands, and
it is jerky, and slugish.  The sound does not even match what is
happening on screen. But with Doom for OS/2 it runs just about full
screen in a window of 320x200(240?)

provided no crash protection in the instance when the machine required a

   Well, MS was the one who advertised (or didn't deny trade press reports)
about Win95 features. If, to have all said features, you need a "Plus! pack"
and have to pay for it, you're not getting your full OS when you buy it.
Maybe had an OS is too much, how about 85% of an OS :-) The last 15% of
the features when you buy the Plus! pack :-)

   So now, features that won't make it into the release but will be
included only in the Plus! pack were never intended to be in a final
release. But some of these features were supposed to be in the final
product, according to magazines at the time.

You mean you aren't?

About the Microsoft testing: The testing lab may be nice, but you can do
tests in a lot of different ways, and you can create self-fulfilling
prophecies by doing tests in certain ways. Unfortunately there's not that
much research (at least little I know of) on the subject of user-friendlyness
done in independent institutions.

User-friendlyness is an extremely subjective matter. One cannot expect
any two people to agree on an issue like this. And please reread my post:
I haven't said Windows 95 is less user-friendly, only that it expects a
lower IQ from the user. That is a polite way of saying that it's an
interface for dummies.

Because you have a hard time distinguishing opinion from fact, I'll say
here that this is all strictly MHO.

>1) Most product, even OS/2 ship with bugs, "known" bugs.

If these are bugs that cannot (or hardly) be fixed, for example because they
have to do with a certain piece of broken hardware, it's okay for me. Most
OS/2 bugs that were known at releasetime fit into that category. We aren't
talking about that kind of bugs, because Microsoft wouldn't be able to
announce a fixpack to fix them now.

If there are bugs in OS/2 that were known at releasetime and deliberately
left unfixed, that is the Wrong Thing, and it doesn't make it legitimate
for Microsoft to do the same with Windows 95.

>2) It is virtualy impossible to be completely "bug-free"

True. But you should always try your best. Microsoft doesn't do that.

>3) Most software, including OS's needs periodic updates and bug-fixes which
>are usualy made abvailable when necessary for free.

True again. But they are necessary only because new information is gained
after release. Release has not yet token place for Windows 95, but Microsoft
seems to already have information based on which a fixpack is necessary.
That MS has found shortcomings already means that:

- there are things that Microsoft knows of, that can be fixed, but won't
get fixed in the release version.
- Windows 95 is a bad product. The real test of a product comes only
after release, but Microsoft knows about some problems already. The
list will get much longer after release, because most problems will be
found only then.
- Based on the previous point, the fixpack for Windows 95 will probably
be very large.

Maintenance releases, yes. This is not all that uncommon. But why was this
hyped so much? Microsoft created its own trap; by hyping a fixpack,
it seemed as if they wanted to apologize for the poor quality of Windows 95.
Just prior to release of a new product, there should be much more
interesting things to hype for Microsoft.

This should be self-evident. That Microsoft hypes it shows that it's
not self-evident for Microsoft, i.e. that MS has done differently in
the past. Whether they will do better now remains to be seen; MS hype
is usually not worth the paper it's printed on.

Also, why do they change their strategy right now? Could it be that they
have to do it, because Windows 95 is too full of bugs to do otherwise?

Which is a good thing by itself. But the stuff surrounding it makes me
extremely suspicious. Call me paranoid if you wish, but based on
Microsoft's previous track records, I still think I have a *reason*
to be paranoid.

PMJI, but Joris uses English a hell of a lot more effectively (and usually
more grammatically) than 98% of the native English and American speakers
in this forum.

Don't criticise his use of English, unless you can use Dutch better than
he does! :-)

On a more serious note, "evil" is one of the few *adult* words I know of.
Children do not understand evil. And few enough adults.

Anyone doubting that last statement should reflect on the unbelieving
acceptance by the so-called civilized world of what is happening in
the former Yugoslavia. Just like the time before, and the time before
that...

Quite a few holocaust victims managed to escape the Nazi death camps and
told their stories to a skeptical America. And what happened? Nothing.
Failure of the imagination is a very serious illness: it can get people
killed.

It has.

To put a lighter spin on this downer post, I assume that most of the
Gentle Readers have seen Polanski's classic "Chinatown". The detective,
J.J. Gittes, had a failure of imagination as regards Noah Cross; some
posters in this forum seem to me to suffer from a similar failure with
respect to a certain large software firm in the Great Northwest of the
United States.

Do you really know what Plus Pack is all about? Plus Pack is just more
extension to the full Windows 95. More utilities. More themes. Make Windows
95 more fun. Saying the Plus Pack is 15% of the OS is as stupid as claiming
that IBMWorks is part of OS/2 warp.

Becauase MS doesn't encourage copying of their API?

I wonder if one of the few commerical Win32s apps, MathCad, is uses the newest
win32s API that does not run under WARP.  Last time I checked they were selling
mathcad to WARP users.

I wasn't really criticising his English, at least not his grammar, until
this moment I was not aware that he does not speak English as a native
language since his posts are always very grammaticaly correct.  I was
questioning his usage of the term "evil" only, which is a valid comment.
"Evil" is a fantasy word that means irretrievably bad or inherently bad,
usualy without cause.  It presupposes an unreal situation, ie- that Microsoft
does what it does out of pure malice and simply to cause pain and suffering,
or to srew people up, which is not only demonstarbly untrue it is childish to
say so.  The user of such a phrase is showing more "evil" themselves in it's
use than they are demonstrating the presence of any "evil".

>On a more serious note, "evil" is one of the few *adult* words I know of.
>Children do not understand evil. And few enough adults.

There is no such a thing as "evil" it is an abstract absolute concept that
exists only in fairy stories, thus it is more "childish" than adult.

This is not only off topic it is total bullshit.  Lots "happened" the whole
world knows what happened in the death camps and will never forget it.  Most
of the people responsigble, and many who wer not wer punished for their
actions.  Many of the survivors lived on to do similar things to other ethnic
groups as was done to them in the death camps.

   In OS/2's bonus pack, there's no extensions to the OS, only applications.
(Some might argue that the IAK is an OS extension, but you still have to
add it yourself on may OSes).

   The Plus! pack contains utilitites, etc. But you said it yourself, it's
an extension to the OS. Thus, making the base OS incomplete. It adds
features to the base OS !

So, then, we cannot use the word "evil" to describe the Third Reich, Adolf
Hitler, Pol Pot, or the Khmyr Rouge, eh?

Frankly, I consider this attitiute to be condescending, insulting, and
frankly, dangerous. "Evil" is NOT a "childish" word. It is real. It exists.
To deny it is to bury your head in the sand like an ostrich, and this, in
turn, allows evil to flourish in the world.

This is getting farther and farther away from the original point.

The original point, as I understand, is that the Plus! pack
contains things that MS has originally promised/said will be
bundled with Win95, not sold separately.

The thing I remember is around the time Warp is released and
people start to brag about the Bonus pak and IAK in Warp, what
Win advocates countered was that Win95 will have similar stuffs
bundled.  It appears not to be the case now.

The main reason I agreed with your doubts about the word 'evil' was that
I had received a similar comment by mail a few earlier. The sender warned
me that use of the word 'evil' could label me as a dangerous fanatic. I
have tried to find a different word that was strong enough, yet didn't
have these connotations. The only words I found which *could* be a
suitable replacement were 'malicious' and 'vicious', but I have no idea
of the stronger connotations of these words, so I won't change anything
for now. Especially 'malicious' is probably not that good a replacement,
since it might imply Microsoft is only trying to do wrong - the same
problem Jeremy has with 'evil'.

The problem is that I need/want a *strong* word, and strong words can
quickly become too strong.

>It presupposes an unreal situation, ie- that Microsoft

Without delving too deep into the psychology of Bill Gates, a line from
the book 'Hard Drive' (IMHO) very well denotes the problem with Gates:
'Bill doesn't want to win, he wants to crush the competition.' There
is, IMHO, evidence that Bill Gates is motivated more by destructive
than constructive 'forces' - in which case 'evil' is not such a bad word
after all.

>The user of such a phrase is showing more "evil" themselves in it's
>use than they are demonstrating the presence of any "evil".

This implies that evil, with the meaning the word has according to
Jeremy, does not exist in real life, something to which I disagree
totally. David's examples of Nazi-Germany and present-day Bosnia
are two very good examples of 'evil'.

>>On a more serious note, "evil" is one of the few *adult* words I know of.
>>Children do not understand evil. And few enough adults.

>There is no such a thing as "evil" it is an abstract absolute concept that

I have the uneasy feeling you prove David's statement about few
people understanding the meaning of 'evil'.. Jeremy, a person, or even
a society based on hatred is not something limited to fairytales, or to
Orwell's 1984. It happens in real life.

>>Anyone doubting that last statement should reflect on the unbelieving

>>that...

>Stupidity, yes.  Obsession, hatered, egomania, yes.  Evil...?

Yes - at least if my current understanding of the meaning of the word
'evil' is correct. What happens in the former Yugoslavia is so incredibly
bad that the word 'evil' certainly isn't too strong.

I have no idea how the media coverage of what happens in Bosnia is in
America - it might not get enough attention in the USA due to the
distance, the OJ Simpson trial, and the isolationistic tendencies in the
USA. Media coverage here is very good, (I could add 'too good' but
something as bad as this deserves all the attention it can get)
partially because the UNPROFOR troops in Srebrenica were Dutch. Based
on what I see on TV, I think it's safe to say that what happens in
the former Yugoslavia is comparable to what happened in Nazi-Germany,
except that it happens on a smaller scale. The fact that it happens
so close to home (less than 2000 km from where I write this) makes it
all the more frightening.

You think so. Too many people are already forgetting it, and an even
larger number cannot grasp what the numbers and pictures mean in real
life.

The only reason we are forced to accept the stories of the survivors
as true is the sheer amount of evidence that supports it. I'm quite sure
most people, even anti-Nazi, wouldn't believe in the Holocaust if things
weren't so obvious. When survivors returned to the Netherlands in 1945,
people didn't believe their stories. My senses know what has happened,
but my emotions can't grasp what it means. It's just too atrocious to
imagine.

With that last sentence you mean Israel and the Palestinians, right?
The Jewish survivors of World War II formed a large group of people,
and included their share of wrongdoers, like any sufficiently large
group of people. If you look at present-day Israel you'll see that the
Jewish extremists form a very small group.

Your first sentence is just completely wrong. I don't know any exact
numbers, but I'm sure that an overwhelming majority of those responsible
were never punished for their deeds.

You probably do not realize the scale of your error. Evil is not an
abstract and unreal concept. Do you think Nazi-Germany, the Pol Pot regime,
or the situation in former Yugoslavia, are anything less than evil? Which
words would you use to describe these examples?

Evil is *not* an abstract concept. If you disagree, read some world
history.

Apparently Hamilton College has a problem with it's faculty.

If you're publishing in mathematics, statistics and even mathamatically
oriented Ecology, TEX is the proper tool for doing the manuscript.  The
Math Society even adopted their own TEX standard.  Some publications
REQUIRE TEX documents or will favor publication of documents in that
format.  There is no better tool for creating technical documents.

Nor do we have any sense of loss over a German Professor's ignorant
musings on topics for which he has no knowledge or interest.

They will not "accelerate" games.  They are simply API's.  You need

No.  But Jeremy has problems understanding that distinction.  he wishes

MicroSoft BOB is a prime example of just how unimportant MS's opinion's
are about it's own software.  Gina Smith has a story on the BOB fiasco
and it's readable on ZIFF's WWW under personalities.  BOB apparently
was at the right place at the right time.  MS feared losing new users
and BOB was in a prototype stage and got the go ahead.   Or so she
reports.  Many inside MS thought BOB was dumb.

PCCompute thinks most bgeinngers will have major problems with
explorer.  Their ad hoc testing shows WIN95' UI to require major
retraining.  I found it easier to pick up than my Win Developer
housemate who does not like it still.  It's a cheesy Ripoff of some of

I'm not trying to make a subjective argument about UI's.  The objective
evaluation of win95's UI is that a win3.1 user will be at a disadvantge
in front of win95.

The problem is that MS is not building on it's UI look and feel people
learned in win3.1 (IBM did with the WPS imporvementnts in WARPthat
enhanced the UI functionality).  MS is changing the UI and that will of
course hurt win95's establishemnt as a win3.1 IMPROVEMENT.

People are trained to use win3.1.  When you put them in front of win95
they are lost.  Many do not like explorer even when shown how to use
it.  MS is not building on the customer base and when MS does move them
to Win95 a customer will be more likely to accept the WPS as a UI since
the two are more similar.

  As long as you can remember what all those key are you are
supposed to be using to do these manipulations.  Everyday I am at Windows
3.1, Win NT, Solaris/Openwindows, Windows95, OS/2, and Linux desktops.  I
don't want to remember those keys.  Win95 is simple.  Use left mouse button
does the default action on a drag.  Use right mouse button gives a menu of
choices.

  Another keyboard/mouse combination.  Do you suppose my parents
(who aren't particularily computer literate) could figure this out
without being told, or going to a manual?  No, of course not, it is not
discoverable.  In Win95 it is.

  The taskbar offers more than just launching of programs, which is
all the launchpad does.  Also, it can be configured to be off of the
screen until you push against the edge of the screen and it will pop up.
In that configuration, it takes up no screen space.  Also, it can be
put on any edge of the screen, (top, bottom, or either side). Do you suppose
clicking both mouse buttons (as OS/2 does it) is discoverable?  The whole
reason for the taskbar was stop people from opening more than one copy of an
application.  In testing MS found that alot of users would open more than
one copy of something because they didnt know where it went when they
minimized it (stupid users, yes, I agree).  When you minimize in Win95,
the title bar shrinks to a spot on the taskbar, visually showing the user
where the applicaiton went.  Do you suppose novice computer users are
going to immediately go for the "minimized programs" folder, or by
instinct, click both mouse buttons in OS/2?  No, I didn't think so.

WARP imposes a new paradigm but unlike win95 it also carries that

Fact.  Maybe you should read about user's feedback and ISM's comments
about retraining costs.  MS's clean break with WIn3.1 is a liability.

False.  The users todate are not typical windows users but people who
wanted to run a BETA.  PCCompute tried Win95 on new users and the
results are not good.  It's got a steep learning curve.

WARP's never claimed to have the advantage of Win3.1's userbase as you
folks like to assume win3.1 will provide Win95 with a instant 40
million users in one year.  WARP's new UI (actually out since 1992) is
not a barrier to users who want a better win3.1 but are getting a whole
new UI!

What you are saying is that Win95 will have the same slow accpetance
WARP had.  I agree.

Not yet.  I don't see MS selling it at all so you have nothing of
substance to say here.  The preview of novice users shows very high
learning curves and ISM's are saying they will wait out the buggy 1st
release.  Both indicate a typiclly slow acceptance of Win95.

>But we'll see on Aug. 24.

We'll see by Feb 96.  Wait until XMAS ends.  MS will do best with home
buyers and win95 should outsell OS/2 WARP 10:1 on new systems if MS's
plans are going to take hold.

I suspect MS will get BAD PR for a buggy release that is already
admitted to be incompatible wioth some sound cards and has defective
applets.  MS shipped a buggy WORD 6.0 MAC and lost a huge amount of
momentum to WP on the MAC.  MS'S 1ST releases are buggy and this one
has such a pressure dead;line that I cannot see MS doing it right at
all.

But a win3.x user is really no less lost when sat down for the first
time in front of a Warp box than (s)he is when presented with win95.
I've used both WPS and win95's shell, and both were about as confusing
to me when I first saw them; WPS may have been slightly more confusing.

Once I learned both, I couldn't really tell if one or the other was
any easier or harder to use. I like both, actually. WPS and win95 UI's
both have their advantages.
And it took me about the same time to learn both; not really too long
of a time.

This is more .advocacy than anything, I'm afraid. Judging by what native
win95 stuff I'v seen (which isn't too much, admittedly) there isn't a
massive loss of consistency between apps and the shell in win95.

Fact. just about all of the 200 former win3.x users here at work agree that
win95 is MUCH better than win3.x; those that don't think it's MUCH better
agree that it's considerably better. The os/2 users are aware than win95
is a good deal faster than os/2, but they don't tend to think it's better.

I get direct user feedback daily, and most of it confirms my suspicion that
win95 is significantly better than win3.x.
A few of us bemoan some of the problems with it, but _none_ wants to go back
to win3.x.

True. The (former) win3.x users I work with every day are nearly all typical
win3.x users; they all agree that win95 is considerably better than win3.x;
most think it's MUCH better.

200 former win3.x users where I work use win95 build 490 all day every day
and the results are _very_ good, especially in client-server situations.
NOONE here thinks win95 is worse than win3.x.

Well, again, I'm not projecting 40 million users of win95 in one year. Heh.
I seriously doubt it will do that.. I think many will wait before upgrading,
becuase either they won't want to get 4 more megs of ram, or they are happy
with what they have. Others will go with other solutions, like NT or os/2
or something else. There is a lot of inertia there.
My hunch is that it will probably sell pretty well; the preorders seem to
be piling up fairly quickly (although my research on that has been pretty
minimal). We'll just have to see how it goes.

>
>What you are saying is that Win95 will have the same slow accpetance
>WARP had.  I agree.

Again, I'm not going to speculate; win95 may indeed be accepted slowly.
I certainly don't think it will sell 20 million before the year's end.
You may be right, it may go really slow; we'll have to just wait and see.

All I'm saying is that Warp is equally matched with win95 as far as
win3.x-user-initial-mystification is concerned. I don't think WPS is
going to be any easier to learn than win95's shell for a typical
win3.x user. IMO, both are very nice shells.

>

This is true. And for that reason, I am making no substantive claims;
I'm really just speculating, so take it for what that is worth.

>learning curves and ISM's are saying they will wait out the buggy 1st
>release.  Both indicate a typiclly slow acceptance of Win95.

Maybe. Maybe not.
But, as I've said all along, win95 will very likely be Good Enough for
the great unwashed. Warts and all, it really is better than win3.x; there's
no question about that. That's all it really needs to be: an upgrade to
win3.x.

Again, we'll just have to wait and see. My hunch is that a lot of win3.x
users are going to go for it, but we won't really know for some time.

Out of the list of Operating Systems that you have used, I can't see
Windows 95 as being one of them.  This leads me to believe that you
are trying to burn an operating system that you haven't even tried.
First use Windows 95, and then let your busy fingers type out this
crap.

Oh, but how Windows 95 is stable... extremly stable.  Much more stable
than OS/2 Warp (which I used for six months before switching to
Windows 95)

Then you have definitely NOT used Windows 95 before or at least have
never installed it.  Installation for me occured without a single
problem (NOT even ONE)  and I had numerous errors installing OS/2
Warp.

I was just talking to someone on IRC and he said that every single one
of the 200+ computers in their company had switched their operating
systems to Windows 95 from either Windows 3.1, Windows NT, Windows
3.11, or OS/2 Warp.  The reason they switched from OS/2 Warp (as he
said it) was that "Windows 95 simply runs faster than OS/2 and is
easier to use)

>   For now, OS/2 has many, many more apps available than Win95.

No it doesn't... All major application companies (Corel, Norton,
Lotus, Microsoft (obviously), and a hell of a lot of games companies
are or have come out with Windows 95 versions of their software.
(Ever heard of Corel Draw 6.0 for Windows 95, Norton Anti-Virus for
Windows 95, Qmodem Pro for Windows 95, Norton Utilities for Windows
95, Doom II for Windows 95, Netscape 1.2 for Windows 95, Office 95,
etc. etc. etc.?)

Okay, let's do a poll among the general population and see how many people
know his name.  Whaddya say?  :) Let's see what the dictionary says:
"household word: a common word, saying, name, or thing that is familiar to
nearly everyone".

Hmmm, I guess he fails that test by a considerable margin.  But I am sure
he can keep working on it.

   The settings in OS/2 are accessed in the same fashion as in Win95, by
right clicking.  This is a feature that was particular to OS/2 until MS
decided to copy it.  I have never had any reason to go digging around in
any *.ini file.  I don't know where you get off implying that it is necessary.
I have also never had to use the Rexx scripting language.  The fact that it
is available though is a major bonus because, if you wanted to take the time
to learn it, you can do some pretty powerful things with it.  A lot of the
shareware programs for OS/2 that I use have their installation routines
written entirely in Rexx.

   Finally, the final statement implies that people who like programming in
DOS will like OS/2.  True.  However, by no means does this mean that people
who do not enjoy programming will not enjoy OS/2.  The statement is strictly
one way.  I love OS/2 but have never used Rexx.  I like the fact that it's
there though because, unlike "stupid" shells like WINxx(.xx), OS/2 provides
its users with a lot of room to grow if they so choose.
