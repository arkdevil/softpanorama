   Here is a collection of some great Visual Basic tools, utilities,
   sample code and VBXs that we have come across on our travels of the
   Net. They can be downloaded from here right now or direct by anonymous
   ftp from ftp.exe.co.uk within the /pub/vbstuff directory.
   
   
   
   If you have created something really useful (can't live without it) in
   Visual Basic or a VB utility/DLL/add-on that you'd like to submit into
   this section please email me at [1]cliffs@exe.co.uk with details (no
   code please!). Anyone who appears in the Spot will receive a free

     * [2]copystop.zip (11 KB)
       COPYSTOP is a utility which may be called by any Visual Basic 2.0
       or 3.0 application using the SHELL keyword. COPYSTOP will return a
       two digit code to indicate whether the application is running on
       the machine on which it was first installed. The programmer may
       then take any chosen action if it is discovered that the
       application has been copied on to a different machine. The aim is
       to provide the Visual Basic developer with a ready means of
       discouraging wholesale copying of his/her products.
       
   
   
     * [3]cswsk10a.zip (191 KB)
       The SocketWrench/VB custom control provides network communication
       services for your Visual Basic application using a third-party
       TCP/IP protocol stack and compatible Windows Sockets library.
       Instead of using API calls, virtually all socket functions can be
       performed by setting control properties and responding to events.
       For those developers who are not familiar with the details of
       socket programming, SocketWrench can also insulate them from many
       of the common pitfalls, without sacrificing functionality or
       flexibility.

       Integra VDB for Visual Basic is a great tool for creating database
       Apps in Visual Basic. The only problem is, the only way to get a
       CIFD control onto a form is to let Integra build the form for you.
       'When I started using TAB/PRO VBX ,' explains the author, 'I
       couldn't let Integra generate my forms because I wanted my
       controls to be on different tabs / pages. Faced with the option of
       typing all the binding information by hand, and doing without a
       CIFD, or letting Integra generate my form and then deleteing all
       the controls, only to create them again, I decided to write a
       utility to insert a CIFD into any form.'
       
   
   
     * [5]manyth31.zip (100 KB)
       Screen saver written in VB - Now implementing password protection!
       There is also a new ShootHoles saver, some minor changes of
       kaliedescope savers, and the line drawing color selection has been
       improved for 256 color displays so that greys are rejected. Also,
       it is now possible to change the frequency of individual savers,
       or even disabling certain savers by adding lines to "Control.ini".
       Also there is a color cycling saver that works with DIB and GIF-
       87a (non-interlaced) format files with both 256 color and Hi-Color
       displays. The slide show routine now also works with GIF-87a
       (non-interlaced) format files which are usually much smaller than
       BMP format files

       Use instead of Visual Basic manuals to view Visual Basic icon,
       bitmap or metafile collection (60 at a time). Will allow you to
       view all your ICO, BMP and WMF files. Determine path and name of
       desired icon, bitmap or metafile or send the info to a Visual
       Basic Load Dialog. Allows 10,000 pictures in your directory

     * [7]qcard2.zip (81 KB)
       QCard.DLL is a dynamic link library that simplifies the creation
       of card games for the Windows 3.x environment. It grew out of the
       author's desire to write his own card games which were as good in
       quality as the Windows solitaire game.
       
   
   
     * [8]sizer.zip (16 KB)
       You can use the Size Master Control (Sizer) to limit the minimum
       and maximum size and shape for any of your forms. The control has
       properties for minimum and maximum tracking size, and maximized
       window size and position. For example, by fixing the minimum
       tracking width, a user will be unable to resize the form smaller
       than the specified limit. When installed on the form, the Sizer
       enforces its limits on the window size during both run and design
       mode.

       (floppy, harddisk, cd-rom, network drive); drive fat-type
       (filesystem type); free diskspace and total diskspace; sectors per
       cluster, bytes per sector for a drive, free clusters and total
       clusters; file-attributes (even hides or unhides subdirectories);

     * [11]vbit120.zip (175 KB)
       VBIT is a library of useful and timesaving routines which makes
       life easier for any Visual Basic programmer. The library offers
       simple, but very powerful routines for string-manipulation; an
       extensively simplified reading/writing of INI-files compared to
       API-calls and routines for reading system-information, i.e.
       available disk space, memory, screen resolution etc. It also
       provides dynamic one/two-dimensional tables (arrays) with smart
       sorting, seek, read files, write to file, linking to spreadsheets;
       encryption algorithms (with no "back-door") and an elegant method
       for copy protection of software and applications.

       access to the Winsock dynamic link library, presenting a set of
       properties to the program.
