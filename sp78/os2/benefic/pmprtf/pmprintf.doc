   Introduction
   """"""""""""
   o   Would you like to use the C standard function 'printf' in your PM
       programs for debugging, occasional error messages, etc.?  

   o   Do you have existing subroutines, that use printf, that you'd like
       to use in PM programs?

   If you answer yes to either of these, you may find the PMprintf tool
   useful.  PMprintf comprises two parts: 

   printf.obj: 
       an object file, compiled with IBM C Set/2, which you link in with
       your PM program just like any other subroutine.  This provides the
       printf service to that program.  You write printf calls in your C
       program in the usual way; the printf subroutine buffers the data
       (on a per-thread basis in multi-thread programs) and adds each
       completed line to a message queue.  For example, the following
       printf call will write a line to the PMprintf application and
       sound the Alert (bell): 

          printf("This seems to work\a\n");

       Sample source (in C) is provided for the printf function.

   pmprintf.exe: 
       a PM application which sets up the queue used by printf and then
       "catches" and displays incoming printf lines.  It is a kind of
       'monitor' or 'virtual console' which will accept lines from any
       number of processes that use printf.  PMprintf offers a number of
       options, including the ability to log the incoming lines to a
       file.  See below for a short description of the options.  

       If PMprintf has been started then it will display the incoming
       lines from printf calls in other processes.  If it has not been
       started, then printf calls are quietly ignored (they return 0, not
       an error).  PMprintf can be started or stopped at any time, and
       printf calls will then become active or be ignored as appropriate.

   Sample source for printf (printf.c) is included in the package; this
   offers certain customization options (for example, you can cause a
   prefix to be added to the start of each line so that different
   applications can have unique output lines, or cause lines to be broken
   at a certain length).  There are also some usage hints, notes, and
   minor restrictions, documented in the header of printf.c.  


   pmprintf.exe
   """"""""""""
   pmprintf.exe, the program that "catches" printf lines, is a standard
   PM application that can be started in any of the usual ways (from a
   window, from a program object, from startup.cmd, etc.).  It presents a
   standard PM window with an action bar and a list box.  The list box is
   used for displaying and scrolling the most recent 300 lines received
   from printf calls in the same or other processes.  You can change the
   font used in the list box by dragging a font from the OS/2 font
   palette and dropping it on the list box.

   The menu bar offers selections for controlling the logging of the
   printf lines to a file called the "LogFile", along with other options.
   The choices are as follows: 


   ----- 'File': control logging to file -----

   'Write all old lines to LogFile': 
       All lines in the list are immediately written to the LogFile.  The
       lines are not erased from the list, are not timestamped, and will
       be truncated if longer than 500 characters.  

   'Log new lines to LogFile': 
       If checked, all incoming lines are written (logged) to the
       LogFile.  The LogFile is opened when logging is activated, and
       closed when de-activated.  

   'Timestamp new lines to LogFile': 
       If checked, all new lines written to the LogFile are prefixed with
       the date and time that the line was sent by the printf subroutine
       (this could be some time earlier than the time of display by
       PMprintf, especially if Pause was used).  The timestamps could
       show the wrong local time if you do not set the TZ environment
       variable (see notes in printf.c for more details).  

   'LogFile name...': 
       Allows alteration of the name of the LogFile.  The default name is
       'c:\pmprintf.log'.  Any previous LogFile in use is closed.  If the
       new LogFile already exists, printf lines will be appended at the
       end of the file.  The dialog box for changing the name also offers
       a 'Log new lines' checkbox, for convenience.  

   'Erase LogFile': 
       Erases ('resets') the current LogFile.  No confirmation is
       requested.  

   'Close': 
       Closes PMprintf (same as selecting Close in the System menu).

   Once changed, the LogFile name, logging state, and timestamp state are
   preserved in OS2.INI, and become the default when PMprintf is next
   started.

   To look at an 'active' LogFile, use a program or command that allows
   shared reading of files.  TYPE is one such command; its output may be
   redirected to a file to take a snapshot copy of the LogFile.  For
   example: 

      type c:\pmprintf.log > snapshot.log


   ----- 'Options': miscellaneous options -----

   'Erase lines': 
       Discards all previously displayed lines.  Use this to clear the
       PMprintf screen and recover the storage used for displaying "old"
       lines in which you have no further interest.  This does not affect
       the LogFile.  

       The 'Esc' key may also be used to clear the PMprintf screen, and
       has the same effects.  

   'Beep on arrival': 
       If checked, PMprintf will beep to alert you when a new line
       arrives from a printf call.  

   'Save window position': 
       Saves the current window position and state (in OS2.INI).  This is
       used when PMprintf next starts, and is also saved automatically if
       PMprintf is Closed or OS/2 is shut down.  

   'Self test': 
       If checked, PMprintf will call printf itself to display a line on
       screen, and then allow selection of lines in the display: each
       selection causes a new line to be added.  This is used to check
       that printf and the queuing mechanism are working.


   ----- 'Pause', 'Restart', and 'Help': -----

   'Pause': 
       Used to stop new printf lines scrolling the screen.  Selecting
       Pause will cause incoming lines to be queued; the 'Pause' choice
       is then replaced by a 'Restart' choice -- no incoming lines will
       be displayed (added to the listbox and displayed) until 'Restart'
       is selected.  

   'Restart': 
       Restarts the displaying of printf files, after 'Pause' has been
       selected (see above).  

   'Help': 
       Displays the program information and Copyright notice, and refers
       to this document.


   Installation
   """"""""""""
   Unpack (unzip) the files from PMPRTF.ZIP into any directory.  To check
   the program works, "start pmprintf" and then select the "Self Test"
   item under "Options".  You should see a line appear in the PMprintf
   window: this was created by the 'printf' subroutine being called by
   PMprintf.   


   Using printf in application programs
   """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
   You can use printf calls in application programs with PM applications
   or not.  The printf subroutine uses sprintf() to do its formatting, so
   output should be identical.

   printf.obj is linked with your main program, just like any other
   subroutine.  If you have problems linking (such as duplicate symbols,
   etc.), try recompiling printf.c with the same options that you use for
   your main program.  You may also need to recompile if you wish to
   change any of the compile-time settings in print.c (such as the
   maximum line length).

   Note that the '\n' newline character is expected (indeed, required)
   before a line is deemed complete and is sent to the catcher
   application (PMprintf) -- see the example in the Introduction to this
   document.  However, once sent, the line is in a public queue and
   should appear even if the sending application then terminates
   abnormally.  See printf.c for more notes and details.   


   Named Queues
   """"""""""""
   By default, the public queue for PMprintf is named "PRINTF32" for the
   32-bit version of PMprintf.  If required, you can set up multiple
   PMprintf sessions with different queue names, by specifying a
   different name as a parameter (up to eight characters) following the
   keyword 'QUEUE' when starting PMprintf.  For example, if started with: 

      start pmprintf queue Fred

   then PMprintf will use the public queue name '\QUEUES\FRED', and the
   name "Fred" will be shown in the title of the PMprintf window.  Note
   that the Self Test function is not available when a named queue is
   used.

   Early versions (1.xx) of PMprintf were 16-bit.  Do not send 32-bit
   printf() output to a 16-bit catcher, or vice versa.
