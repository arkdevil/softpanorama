CHANGES SINCE LAST POSTING

As most of the last 12 months postings never reached comp.lang.c++, or 
the rtfm.mit.edu archive, there have been many changes. Future issues will
summarise the changes here.

---------------------------------------------------------

Here is the latest draft of a list of available C++ libraries I am 
compiling. I intend to post this once a month or so (unless there are any
complaints). Sorry about the long gap since the last posting.

It is also submited to news.answers, and is available for public ftp
(along with all the other Usenet FAQ lists) at rtfm.mit.edu (18.70.0.209), 
in pub/usenet-by-group/comp.lang.c++/C++_FAQ/libraries.

Rtfm.mit.edu also has a mail server - send a mail message containing 
"usenet-by-group/comp.answers/C++-faq/libraries" to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu.
If you want to find out more about the mail server, send a message to it
containing "help". 

Marshall Cline's C++ FAQ is also available from rtfm - the files are
called _posting_#1_4, _posting_#2_4, _posting_#3_4 and _posting_#4_4, and
they are in the same directory. 

I have not included a credits list, because it would be nearly as large as
the rest of the file! Many thanks to all those who contributed, and I 
hope you won't be offended that I haven't mentioned you. 

Entries are in the order I received them, i.e. totally random. Some future
version might have the entries in alphabetical order, but don't hold your 
breath :-)

If your library isn't mentioned, or you wish to update your entry in this 
list, feel free to mail me the new entry.  Please note that entries will 
be restricted to a couple of paragraphs - if you send me a 100k text file 
giving minute details, I will have to summarise it. It is much easier for 
me if you just send me an entry which is the right size to start with.

Suggested points to include in your entry are ...

Name of package.
Brief summary of purpose.
Short list of features.
Supported compilers, operating systems etc.
Licence restrictions. Vendors may care to give an idea of prices.
E-mail addresses for more details.
Ftp site(s).
Postal address/telephone/FAX numbers.

Please mail comments, criticisms, additions and amendments to me at
cpplibs@trmphrst.demon.co.uk. However, please DO NOT mail me with requests
for assistance in finding files mentioned in the list. I am unable to 
provide such a service. Definite information such as "file xyz is no 
longer at site xxx" IS welcome - even better if you can tell me an 
alternative site where it can be found. If you are new to the Internet, 
try to find out about tools such as archie, whois, www, gopher etc. I 
recommend the newsgroups "news.announce.newusers" and "news.answers" 
for starters.

*** *** *** *** *** NOTE TO VENDORS *** *** *** *** ***
This FAQ contains details of both free and commercial libraries. Vendors
who have sent me details of their libraries for inclusion in the FAQ have
been pleasantly surprised by the level of interest generated. Please
remember, I only allow 2 or 3 paragraphs describing the product, and no
advertising hype !

CBMT - Collaborative BioMolecular Tools

	CBMT provides a number of easy-to-use fundamental classes for
biologists, chemists and crystallographers.  They include:  Molecular
Structure, Sequence, Standard Formats (PDB, CIF, GCG, etc), Geometry,
Statistics, TextParsing, and a single container class (a dynamic 
Array).  All documentation is in HTML, and member functions have *.c
examples.  I hope that the system can be extended as a communal effort and
am piloting this idea in the C++ course at the Globewide Network Academy
(http://info.desy.de/gna/html/cc/index.html)
	Version 1.3 will be posted shortly including an experimental
script language (generated automatically from the *.h files) providing
support for persistent objects manipulatable by other languages such as
tcl or csh. 

Free, but not resellable.

Objtran and Objdce

Objtran is a set of C++ class libraries that provide a higher-level
abstraction for programmers developing applications using OSF's DCE
and Transarc's Encina. Objtran actually consists of two separate
libraries -- Objdce and Objtran.

Objdce makes it easier to write DCE applications by abstracting some
of the more complex aspects of DCE. A class is included that can
manage an RPC server, interacting with the DCE Name Service and
Security Service as desired. Another class manages a client's binding
to a server and encapsulates Name Service lookups.  Other classes
allow the programmer to use threads and various forms of
mutual-exclusion locks, report errors consistently, utilize Access
Control Lists, handle timestamps from the DCE Time Service, and
perform UUID manipulation.

Objtran is built on top of Objdce, and adds support for the Encina
distributed transaction service. It is intended to be used with C++
programs instead of the "Transactional C" macro package. It fully
encapsulates the Encina TRAN and TRPC facilities with a few
easy-to-use classes. It also provides an efficient recovery service
for proper control of distributed transactions, and has support for
the TM/XA service, allowing interoperability with XA-compliant
databases. Support for the Encina Monitor is being implemented so
programs may, with very few code changes, use either the smaller and
more efficient bare Objtran environment or the more sophisticated
Monitor.

RTTI library

Till RTTI becomes a part of regular compilers (BC 4.0 is the sole implementor
I think) these RTTI libraries provide an excellent tool for the same purpose. 

The library is claimed to be portable. No licence restrictions.

Aisearch - a package to make writing problem solving programs easier.

Offers the programmer a set of search algorithms that may be used to
solve all kind of different problems. The following search algorithms
have been implemented: 

    - depth-first tree and graph search.
    - breadth-first tree and graph search.
    - uniform-cost tree and graph search.
    - best-first search.
    - bidirectional depth-first tree and graph search.
    - bidirectional breadth-first tree and graph search.
    - AND/OR depth tree search.
    - AND/OR breadth tree search.

Although this package is meant as a tool for developing problem solving 
software it is not meant exclusively for programmers that are familiar with
the concept of problem representation and search techniques. The document
accompanying this package first describes (though condensed) the theory of
problem solving in AI and next explains how the search class library must be
used. Furthermore, as the source code is richly commented and as also some
demo programs are included the package should also prove useful to people that
want to get acquainted with the subject.

DOSTmUit - DOS Text Mode User Interface Toolkit

Enables C++ programmers to add a CUA-compliant user interface to their
DOS programs without getting involved in screen coordinates and other
messy details. The programmer merely states which interface objects are
required, and how they are to be placed on the screen in relation to each
other. Those familiar with the ET++ toolkit for the X windows system
under Unix will get the general idea. 

Includes a class documentation facility (DocClass) which will generate a
large text file from the source code giving details of every class,
structure, enum and extern in the toolkit. This program will also work on
your own C++ source code. Source is provided. 

Supported compilers are Zortech C++ 3.0r4, Borland C++ 3.1.

The toolkit is free for non-commercial use. Commercial licences may be 
obtained from the author.

Texas Persistant Store

Paul R. Wilson and Sheetal V. Kakkad
Object-Oriented Programming Systems research group (oops@cs.utexas.edu)
Computer Sciences Dept., University of Texas at Austin

Texas is a free persistent store that can be used with standard C++ compilers,
and works efficiently with very little modification to most C++ programs.
It runs on several varieties of UNIX and should be very easy to port to most
modern operating systems, such as OS/2, Windows NT, Mach, Windows 4.0, etc.
(If things we hear are correct, Linux will provide the necessary virtual
memory features soon, too, and Texas will be ported about fifteen minutes 
later. :-)

Texas uses "pointer swizzling at page fault time", an address translation
techique that converts pointers from an abstract format to actual virtual
memory addresses when pages are first touched and brought into memory.
(A similar technique, invented independently, is used in the market-leading
persistent store/OODB, ObjectStore from Object Design Inc.)  This allows
Texas to be highly portable, avoiding any assumptions about where a page
of data will be an a process' virtual memory address space; it can also
support very large addresses spaces efficiently on stock 32-bit hardware.
(It could also be used to efficiently provide shared address spaces across
networked heterogenous machines with different hardware address sizes, e.g.,
across 32- and 64-bit machines.)

Lily (LIsp LibrarY) C++ class library which gives C++ programmers the
capability to write LISP-style code. 

I think Lily will be useful in academia for instructors who
want to teach artificial intelligence techniques with C++.  The
garbage collection mechanism employed by Lily is slow which will make it
unattractive for commercial use.

Documentation is minimal.  The "Lily User's Guide" (in file lily.txt) provides
a good overview of the architecture of Lily -- the document is unfinished.  
All of the example programs are from Winston's book "LISP Second Edition" so
you will be much better off if you have a copy.  Steele's "Common LISP" 
describes the behavior of the LISP functions.  

Lily uses the GNU Library General Public License.

Lily works well with GNU g++ version 2.4.5 (and probably earlier releases).

Lily works with Turbo C++ for Windows but not with Turbo C++ (though the
current version hasn't been tested with Turbo C++ for Windows).

Lily does *not* work with AT&T's cfront because cfront does not handle 
temporary objects very well.

DiamondBase is a library of C++ routines and utilities that allow you 
to add Relational Database functionality to your C++ programs. It
is written entirely in C++, and great pains have been taken to
ensure it compiles under a variety of compilers including gcc,
cfront and Borland's C++ compiler for OS/2. It runs on a wide
variety of Unix platforms and OS/2. There are no plans to support
DOS or Windows at the moment. It comes with a 47 page manual.

GINA++ - An O-O application framework for C++, X11R5, and OSF/Motif

Requires:  AT&T 3.0 based C++ compiler (Sun C++ 2.0.1), X11R5, Motif 1.2
Platforms supported:    Sun Sparc, HP

GINA++ (The Generic INteractive Application for C++) is an object-
oriented application framework that facilitates the development of
applications with a graphical user interface. It is written in C++ and
uses OSF/Motif and X for the user interface parts. GINA++ comes as a
library of C++ classes, 10 small to medium demo applications, and it is
fully documented. 

Components of GINA++ are: (1) A C++ encapsulation of OSF/Motif providing
easy-to-use mechanisms for deriving new widget classes completely in C++,
(2) Support for object-oriented graphics (rectangles, arrows, circle,
etc), (3) An unlimited undo/redo history mechanism, (4) supporting
classes for data structures (list, arrays, etc), run-time type
information, and a notification mechanism. 

The classes of GINA++ constitute an executable program - the generic
application - which possesses the basic functionality and the user
interface components common to all interactive graphical applications,
but lacks any application-specific behavior. The predefined functionality
and behavior is inherited by deriving subclasses from the existing GINA++
classes. Application specific behavior is implemented by adding new
classes and member functions. Differences to the standard application are
coded by refining virtual member functions inherited from GINA++.

OATH (Object-oriented Abstract Type Hierarchy) was designed
as an experiment in increasing object-oriented reuse.
It has a fairly high learning curve, but potentially 
higher gains if you are looking for a more flexible and
robust abstraction.  It is completely unsupported.

NIHCL (National Institute of Health's C++ Library) is
essentially a mapping of part of Smalltalk's library
into C++.  It lies somewhere between OATH and COOL.
It is a little better supported and there is a textbook
by the author, Keith Gorlen, that is fairly good documentation.
However, the Smalltalk hierarchy is not completely 
consistent (IMO) with the C++ strong typing nature.
It is weakly supported.

excellent examples of multiple inheritance used profitably. I understand
that InterViews development will not continue past the current version;
author Mark Linton is concentrating his efforts on the X Consortium
Fresco project, which should show up in X11R6.

from Germany. It is available for educatioal purposes but its NOT in the
public domain. 

Provides basic data-types like lists, stacks, queues, trees, sets,
partitions, priority queues and a few others. These are parameterizable
classes, you may add your own datatype and have a priority queue ...
An important datatype is a graph, these are also parameterizable and there
are useful algorithms for them like shortest path, transitive closure,
matching, maximum flow, spanning tree and others, we have implemented a few
algorithms for dealing with perfect graphs, but these ar not part of the
standard library. The latest part deals with computational geometry.

It can be used with C++ compilers which understand templates, such as 
cfront 3.0 and g++ 2.4.5.

A couple of functions that ought to be in the standard
C++ environment;
- Updated G++ class File that allows now for the file name to
  include pipes, say,
    File in_file("zcat aaa.Z |","r");
- Resource facility, or managing global "private" parameters
  that specify various program "options". It helps keep

The SPLASH c++ class library

(Small Perl-like List And String Handling class library)

SPLASH is a c++ class library that implements many of the Perl
constructs and data types, including extensive regex regular expression 
pattern matching.

For those not familiar with Perl, it is an excellent scripting language
by Larry Wall and is available for most platforms.

This Class library provides List, String, Regular Expression, and text
manipulation handling capabilities based on those provided in Perl.

This is available as a compressed tar file, shar file, .zoo or .zip format
with MSDOS compatible names.

OSE is a collection of programming tools and class libraries for C++. The
core of the environment is the C++ class libraries, of which three are
provided. These are:

  OTCLIB - A library of generic components, including support for error
  handling, error message logging, error recovery, program debugging,
  memory management, resource management, generic collections, text
  manipulation, operating system interfacing and event driven systems.

  OUXLIB - A library of components which primarily extends classes in the
  OTCLIB library to support features specific to the UNIX operating
  system.

  OTKLIB - A library of components which builds on the OTCLIB and OUXLIB
  libraries to allow integration of the TCL/TK library into applications
  using the event driven systems framework provided by the OTCLIB
  library.

The C++ libraries are portable to a wide range of C++ compilers on the UNIX
platform. Supported C++ compilers include those from USL (CFRONT), DEC, HP,
IBM, Lucid, SGI, SUN, CenterLine and ObjectStore, as well as the freely
available GNU C++ compiler. If your C++ compiler does not support
templates, it is possible to use a template preprocessor which is supplied
with OSE. Portability to all the major variants of UNIX has been achieved.
Supported platforms include BSD, HPUX, IRIX, Linux, OSF, SCO, Solaris,
SunOS, SYSV and Ultrix. In addition to being available under UNIX, the
OTCLIB library is portable to DOS and OS/2 using Borland and Watcom C++
compilers.

OSE was winner of CODA'94, the ComputerWorld Object Developer Awards which
is held in conjunction with ObjectWorld in Sydney, Australia. The category
in which OSE was a winner was "Best implementation of a reusable development
environment for company deployment".

PDBlib is a class library written in C++ for modeling a macromolecular
structure at the level of detail (excluding symmetry information) found
in a Protein Data Back (PDB) file. A class is supplied to read a PDB file
into a PDBlib representation. This class is independent of the actual
representation and other forms of input, for example from a relational
database like SESAM, are possible. 

The library is made extensible by a close coupling between intrinsic and
external classes. By writing only to the external classes you will remain
compliant with future versions of the library. 

You don't get source code. This is a temporary situation while we attempt
to centralize bug fixes and additions to the library. If you find this
situation unworkable source code is available by signing a copyright
agreement which is available with the distribution.

PARODY : C++ DATABASE LIBRARY

Al Stevens has written a book on the subject called
`Database programming in C++' or something. An article
on the subject was printed in Doctor Dobbs Journal
some time ago.

The nice thing is that Stevens also wrote a C++ library
adding persistence to C++, and the source is available.
The library is called PARODY and compiles under most
DOS-based C++ compilers. A slight rewrite of the GUI-
routines has to be done to make it compile under GNU C.

This is an initial release and people should *expect* to have to do some
work to get it running on their system. If you have gcc-2.3.3, libg++-2.
3[.1], Gnu make and makedepend you shouldn't have too much difficulty
however. The code is unsupported, and is distributed under the terms of

C++SIM 1.0  - a simulation package written in C++. 

C++SIM provides discrete process based simulation similar to that
provided by the simulation class and libraries of SIMULA. The linked list
manipulation facilities provided by SIMSET are also included in the
package. 

The simulation package requires the use of a threads package and
currently only works with Sun's lightweight process library or the Gnu
thread package (which *is* included in the distribution). The package has
been used on Sun workstations, and, with the exception of the thread
library requirement, contains no system specific code which should make
porting to other systems relatively easy. The code has been compiled
with Cfront 2.1 and Cfront 3.0.1 and g++ 2.3.3

ADAPTIVE Communication Environment (ACE) C++ IPC wrappers (C++Wrapper).

This release contains contains the source code, documentation, and
example test drivers for a number of C++ wrapper libraries and higher-
level distributed application frameworks developed as part of the
ADAPTIVE project at the University of Calfornia, Irvine. 

The C++ wrappers encapsulate many of the user-level BSD and System V
Release 4 IPC facilities such as sockets, TLI, select and poll, named
pipes and STREAM pipes, the mmap family of memory-mapped file commands,
System V IPC (i.e., shared memory, semaphores, message queues), and
explicit dynamic linking (e.g., dlopen/dlsym/dlclose) using type-secure,
object-oriented interfaces. 

The higher-level distributed application frameworks integrate and enhance
the lower-level C++ wrappers to support the configuration of concurrent
network daemons composed of monolithic and/or stackable services 

A relatively complete set of documentation and extensive examples are
included in the release. A mailing list is available for discussing bug
fixes, enhancements, and porting issues regarding ACE. Please send mail
to ace-users-request@ics.uci.edu if you'd like to become part of the
mailing list.

CB++ (CommonBase Database Access Library for C/C++)

This library was written in 1989 as a basis for storing C++ objects in
a relational database. The development of such a system was stopped in
1990 because of problems with the MS-DOS environment used in this time.
My involvement in various user interface projects here in the institute
and otherwhere made it sleep until last week.

Okay, here is it. It is only the database access layer of the projected
object storage system but it has some useful features which are provided
by commercial tools out there:

* Builds on the C language interface of a database, there is no need
  for a precompiler (like embedded SQL - which is totally unusable in
  combination with C++, at least it was three years ago...)
* Very simple to use. Unlike the native C interfaces of the databases
  it is as simple as embedded SQL or some 4th generation languages.
* Makes applications portable among different SQL databases. The library
  itself is relatively easy to port as the database vendor specific code

DCE++: A C++ API for Programming Distributed Systems

William Leddy, Arjun Khanna (arjun@hal.com)
HaL Computer Systems, Austin, Texas.

DCE++ is a set of ANSI C++ classes that enable the rapid prototyping of
distributed programs. The goal of DCE++ is to provide a platform
independent C++ API to the significant components used in distributed
computing. Namely: RPC, threads, Security and Naming across the widely
used distributed computing platforms such as DCE, ONC and WNT. 

It is expected that by encapsulating platform dependencies inherent in
setting up rpcs, security etc. in DCE++ base classes, program development
time can be drastically reduced. Moreover, a foundation can be provided
for developing *portable* distributed program development tools. 

The second *evaluation* version of DCE++, version 0.4, has been released
on Dec 2'93. The release includes C++ bindings for remote procedure calls
over DCE and ONC. A C++ threads api for programming DCE threads. A C++
threads api for programming DCE distributed Time Service. The release is
available free of charge upon signing a very liberal license agreement. 

The license agreement is obtainable by anonymous ftp from hal.com. It is
in the directory dce++. The same directory also contains the release
notes for the 0.4 version and plans for 0.5 features. To obtain the code,
please send the signed license agreement to:

WinSockets++ 1.1: A C++ class library for WinSockets.

The poster sent me the following paragraph. It has a little too much hype 
for my taste. (S)he also included a complete copy of the Programmers Guide
- I am afraid I don't have time to read and summarise it here.

This is more than just a wrapper for the WinSockets calls. It provides
higher-level functions that make reading/writing to sockets very easy.
Additionally, the Async aspect of the library makes using the
asynchronous functionality of WinSockets *very* easy and your code *very*
clean. 

It costs $50 which includes full source.

Distinct TCP/IP for Windows Software Development Kit

C++ Class Libraries for FTP, Telnet and Windows Sockets.

Allows developers to develop TCP/IP applications without making calls
directly to a C Dynamic Link Library (DLL). Applications are created
using the Distinct C++ Class Libraries, which take care of establishing
the connection between the client and server side of the application. All
functionality normally associated with calling a TCP/IP application is
taken care of by setting data members and by handling upcall events.
Applications are notified of errors, connection changes and incoming data
by an upcall posted by the library to the applications window, by
providing a callback function to the library or by making polling calls
to the library at frequent intervals. 

Supported compilers: Microsoft C++ version 7 and Visual C++ 1.0 and 1.5.

Standard Edition:$495.00
Professional Edition:$695.00

Generic++

Class library with container classes and basic data types for the 
development of portable, object-oriented applications

This C++ library is completely new. It is aimed at commercial users 
and implements a generous selection of application-independent 
basic classes. Its use frees the user from error-prone and time-con-
suming specific tasks (e.g. main memory management). 
All libraries previously available on the market are targeted more or 
less specifically on a particular system environment. However, it is 
becoming more and more urgent to make as many application mod-
ules as possible independent of a specific target platform. What 
gives Generic++ its competitive edge is the portability of its com-
ponents and the way it takes account of other software engineering 
aspects.

Advantages: * Implementation of the most important application-
independent basic classes * Availability on all standard operating 
systems and platforms * Accommodation of the latest C++ exten-
sions such as templates and exception handling * Co-existence with 
other libraries * High degree of runtime efficiency and low resource 
consumption * Integrated debugging support * Template-based, 
typesafe container classes with interchangeable implementation 
data structures * Suitability for use in the development of client/
server applications in heterogeneous networks.

DiaViews++

Class library for the development of graphical user interfaces 
(GUI) in OSF/Motif and C++

This library combines the power of the OSF/Motif toolkit with the 
advantages of the C++ language by means of completely encapsu-
lating the Motif objects (widgets/gadgets). This means there is a 
C++ class for every Motif object. 
DiaViews supports the structured, object-oriented development of 
Motif interfaces. 
C++ features such as rigorous type checks and virtual functions, etc. 
enhance the efficiency of the development process. 

Advantages: * Uniform C++ interface with OSF/Motif * Frame-
work for generating reusable UI components * Use of callback 
objects * Interface with Dialog Builder, the interactive tool from 
Siemens Nixdorf for OSF/Motif user interfaces * Simple and relia-
ble handling of Motif resources * Automatic generation of make-
files * Minimal training overhead.

BCM

Class library for the support of inter-process communication (IPC)

The class library BCM (Base Communication Module) supports 
both general communication (local and network-wide) and an inte-
grated name service. BCM implementation is based on Internet 
Sockets, which use the TCP/IP protocol. This means that the C++ 
input/output streams can be made transparent for use in inter-proc-
ess communication. 

Advantages: * The user does not have to bother about platform-spe-
cific details * Classes are available for transport, the dispatcher, 
data representation, the message header and the name service.

OSQLIF

Class library for the development of SQL database applications

This library connects an SQL database with an application written 
in C++. The new options offered by the object-oriented language 
make it possible to implement a considerably more efficient user 
interface than is possible with the traditional `embedded' SQL. The 
aim is to set up a simple and efficient connection between an SQL 
database and an application developed in C++. SQL data types and 
both dynamic and static SQL are supported. This means that all the 
features of an SQL database can be accessed from a C++ applica-
tion.

Advantages: * The user can forget about a large number of data-
base-specific details with regard to communication * Secure inte-
gration in object-oriented C++ applications * When ANSI-SQL is 
used, the application can be ported between various databases.

Matrix.h++ includes all the functionality of Math.h++.  For example:
general matrices, vectors, statistics, complex numbers, Fast Forier
Transformation (FFT's), etc.  Matrix.h++ adds specialized matrix classes
such as banded, symmetric, positive-definite, Hermitian, tridiagonal, etc.
Because Matrix.h++ includes Math.h++, it can take advantage of
Math.h++'s highly optimized low-level assembly routines, making it fast
as well as graceful.

of Matrix.h++, plus all of the functionality in the original and well-
established Fortran version; including solutions of systems of equations
for a variety of matrix types, solutions of over- and under-determined
systems of equations, incremental least squares solvers, etc.  But,
Linpack.h++ is a tru object-oriented library, not just a C version that
compiles under C++:  the traditional messiness of the Fortran version has
been replaced with high-level, yet efficient, objects that make code far
easier to write and maintain.

Galaxy

This is a C UI library, but it's written in an object-oriented style and
is type safe for C++ use. The package includes a WYSIWYG GUI builder. 

The tools are, reportedly, pretty full-featured. User-interface items
have extensive abstraction (for example, they have a confirmation-type
dialog that resolves to a push-pin and 'apply' button under openlook, but
'ok', 'apply', 'cancel' buttons under motif). Objects can be positioned
relative to each other (rather than merely absolute position on the
screen). Also, errors are handled with an abstract exception handling
framework. They support internationalization of fonts (at least Japanese),
money, and data formatting. 

Some extra-cool features include memory leak detection and C-language
objects for text (multi-styled, multi-font text with embedded graphics),
list (spreadsheet-like for handling up to 2^31 x 2^31 cells with
customizable displays), and graphics processing.

NetClasses++, C++ classes for message passing environments:

NetClasses is a set of C++ class libraries that is organized as an object-
oriented software toolkit for distributed, message-passing based
programming. 

Facilities include :

Transporting objects over a network. NetClasses can transport: Arbitrary
C++ objects derived from PostModern's TransObject class, arbitrary NIH-
derived objects, and NetClasses Typed Objects. 

NetClasses Typed Objects provide an object-oriented data transport in
which the structure and organization of objects is specified externally
in configurable files using a simple, programming language independent
abstract syntax notation, the NetClasses Abstract Syntax Notation (NASN).

Remote method invocations (RMI). Using RMI, an application on machine B
can invoke a method on machine A. RMI makes fault tolerance and
connection management transparent to the application programmer. The RMI
layer is built on top of the distributed services package that is
described below. 

Reading and writeing all three varieties of NetClasses-transportable
objects on streams using machine-independent external representations. 

Currently available on Sun SPARC; currently testing on HP workstations.

ILOG C++ Software Components

ILOG VIEWS 2:C++ library and editor to design Very Graphical User Interfaces

ILOG VIEWS 2 high-level C++ class library is fully extensible and 
portable across Windows, OS/2, and Unix platforms.  It includes:
- portable resources, event management, and PostScript support
- a portable multi-look gadget library
- extensive 2D graphic object library including charts and gauges
- PowerObjects such as graph layout, spreadsheet, and Gantt chart  
- management of multiple views & layers (for cartographic applications)
- double buffering, infinite undo, zooming, and other editing operations
  
The development of portable VGUI applications is accelerated through 
ILOG PowerEdit, an extensible VGUI builder that generates standard C++ 
code.  PowerEdit reusable components are provided with ILOG VIEWS 2 so 
that developers can create and distribute their own custom editors.  

ILOG VIEWS 2 Dynamic Variable mechanism offer an interpretor for 
writing C formulae between variables to control the attributes of 
objects.  This allows for code-free animation and control of graphics 
objects.

ILOG VIEWS 2 provides a message translation mechanism so that messages 
used in the interfaces may be translated dynamically. The look and feel 
of ILOG VIEWS 2 applications can be changed dynamically from Motif to 
Windows on all platforms.

Platforms: DEC OSF/1, HP, IBM, Silicon Graphics, and Sun workstations
(both SunOS and Solaris) as well as on PCs running Microsoft Windows 3.1,
Windows NT, and OS/2 Presentation Manager. Demonstration CD-ROM available
upon request. 

ILOG BUILDER:
  is a GUI builder that generates OSF/Motif interfaces in C and C++.  It
  offers UIL read/write capabilities and tight integration with ILOG
  VIEWS.

ILOG DB LINK:
  is a C++ library to connect RDBMS such as Sybase, Oracle, Ingres,
  Informix, or SQLBase to C++ applications.

ILOG SERVER: C++ object server implementing real-time groupware applications

ILOG SERVER is a C++ library and preprocessor for building reactive
servers of C++ objects. It offers a client-independent external
abstraction of the data, which ensures the coherence of the shared
objects. Each client: 
- has its own API (Application Programming Interface) 
- only has to be concerned with the objects it manipulates
- does not have to worry about other clients sharing the same objects 

ILOG SERVER is an extension of the SmallTalk Model View Controller (MVC)
architecture to manipulate custom C++ objects instead of fundamental data
types. Developers describe object models by annotating their header files
using about 15 predefined keywords. Once the header files have been
annotated, ILOG SERVER's C++ preprocessor automatically generates the
appropriate C++ code. 

By extending the notion of a C++ pointer as a data member, ILOG SERVER
makes it possible to easily build relationships with cardinalities 
between C++ classes that will automatically be maintained.  This 
extension to C++ supports inheritance and relationships based on smart 
pointers.

Platforms: DEC OSF/1, HP, IBM, Silicon Graphics, and Sun workstations
(both SunOS and Solaris) 

Cost: $5,000 per Unix-based development license. Preferred university
rates available upon request. Demonstration CD-ROM available 

ILOG BROKER: C++ library and preprocessor that extend the C++ language 
to transparently support Distributed Object Computing environments.  

Developers can make any existing linked C++ application distributed, by
minimally changing their header files. A set of about 15 keywords enable
ILOG BROKER's preprocessor to generate standard C++ code. 

Once the header files have been annotated, the preprocessor automatically
generates the C++ source code to build the distributed application.
Communication between objects is performed through the use of local
surrogates calling methods on the real implementation objects across a
network. The current implementation relies on RPC for the transportation
layer. ILOG BROKER annotations have also been designed to generate IDL
code for CORBA 2 specifications. 

ILOG BROKER does not impose the use of a dedicated server.  Each object 
in the distributed application can be both a client and a server to and 
for other objects, therefore providing a true peer-to-peer programming 
tool.

Platforms: DEC OSF/1, HP, IBM, Silicon Graphics,
and Sun workstations (both SunOS and Solaris)

Cost: $5,000 per Unix-based development license. Preferred university
rates available upon request. 

ILOG SOLVER: 
  is a C++ constraint reasoning library for solving complex resource
  management problems such as scheduling, configuration, and planning.

ILOG SCHEDULE:
  is an add-on library to ILOG SOLVER dedicated to solving scheduling
  problems.

ILOG RULES: 
  is a C++ tool for data monitoring in real-time environments.  ILOG
  RULES embeddable inference engine applies rules directly on native C++
  application objets.

ILOG TALK: 
  is an object-oriented dynamic language offering a seamless integration
  with C++ class libraries.

GEMSTONE Object Oriented Database

Briefly, GemStone is a full featured OODBMS with transaction control,
multiple users, multiple platforms supported, client server architecture,
active objects (ie, behavior can occur in the database as well as in the 
application using it), multiple language support, etc.

GemStone is actually quite a bit more than just a data repository - it is a
full-fledged DBMS that is pure OO. You can access the same database just as
easily from C, C++, or SmallTalk, or you can build entire database
applications inside the database server, because it is an active server
that runs methods written in our DML, OPAL, which is a dialect of
SmallTalk. There are also high-level tools to aid application building.

M++

M++ isn't as well known as the RogueWave math.h++ libraries, but it has
been around for many years. It has a number of features that distinguish
it from the RogueWave classes, notably improved handling of temporaries. 

M++ was explicitly designed to provide the functionality of an array
language like Matlab or Gauss and it contains the Linpack, Eispack stuff
found in RogueWave's Linpack.h++. 

Dyad Software, also sell modules written in M++ for doing statistical
work, including linear and nonlinear least squares estimation, as well as
optimization, numerical integration, and differential equations.

The USL UNIX Toolchest is an electronic catalog for browsing and ordering
source software. This catalog provides unsupported software products,
developed within AT&T, for the commercial UNIX world. As you browse
through the online catalog, you'll find descriptions of all the tools,
complete with information on memory and disk requirements, documentation,
and license fees. 

United States and Canada, may access the Toolchest by dialing 1-908-522-
6900(e-7-1) and logging in as "guest". 

Note : The USL UNIX Toolchest is no longer marketed by USL or Novell; it
has reverted back to AT&T. The only contact info I have for it is the US
number 800-462-8146, option #2.
