        Description: This is a Quickie HTML viewer and converter, a very
        useful tool for viewing web documents off-line, with hypertext
        linking and colours.  You can also use this program to simply
        convert HTML documents to standard text files.  Uses extended
        memory (XMS) for loading large files.  This program can also be
        used for viewing standard text files.  Copy text to the Windows
        clipboard.  Now comes with the RUNBROWS.EXE program for linking
        to your main web browser (in Windows 95).


                           THIS PROGRAM IS FREEWARE.



           Usage: vh [/b] [filename or search pattern]

            For example:

              vh        (to be prompted for a filename to view)   

              vh filename.htm     (to view file)

              vh /?               (for help)

              vh /b filename.htm  (to convert to .txt)

              vh /b *.htm   (to convert all .htm files to .txt)



                             RECENT IMPROVEMENTS:


        v2.5:  

         - Improved international character support.

         - Faster reading of text files.




                             CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:


        Changes to configuration are made in the VH.INI file.

        Enter the full path and file name for your main web browser
        where it says "Browser=".  This will enable you to view files in
        a full graphical environment or visit links on the Internet
        should you want to. [The program RUNBROWS.EXE will need to be
        in the same directory as VH.EXE if you want to use this
        feature]

        Graphic images are represented by the text "[i]".  Edit the
        VH.INI file to specify the graphics viewer you want to use
        for viewing graphics.

        If you don't want the graphics image links to be displayed at
        all you can turn the option off (set to 0) in the VH.INI
        file.

        For full screen viewing you can turn off the title bar and the
        prompt bar in the same file.

        And you can also select between different color sets and set the
        number of screen lines to be displayed.

        If you want the spacebar to execute a PgDn command rather than 
        scrolling down one line then edit the line in the .INI file.






                               VIEWING FUNCTIONS:


        THE MOUSE:

          Left click
            - on a highlighted link to make the jump, or view a graphic.
            - on keywords at the bottom of the screen.
            - on the right edge of the screen, above and below the
              marker to page up and page down.  You can also drag the
              marker for moving quickly through a document.
            - on the left edge of the screen to move backwards and
              forwards through recently visited links.  Click in the top
              half of the left edge to go back, and in the bottom half
              to go forewards.
            - at top left corner to turn the top title bar on and off.
            - at bottom left corner to turn the bottom prompt line on
              and off. 

          Right click
            - anywhere on the screen to bring up a menu for copying text
              to the Windows clipboard.
            - on a highlighted link to copy the link URL to the
              clipboard (from where you can paste it into Netscape if
              you want to go there).  From here you can also open the
              link in your main web browser (in Windows95), either to 
              view a file which is already on your hard disk, or 
              connect directly to a site on the internet if you are 
              currently online.


        THE KEYBOARD:

        If no mouse installed then:
          - Tab and Shift-Tab to select a link.
          - Enter to load the linked file.

        "F" to find text in the current document.

        "R" or Ctrl-L or Enter: to repeat the last find operation.

        "B" to open the current file in your main web browser, which 
            is specified in the VH.INI file.  To use this feature
            the program RUNBROWS.EXE needs to be in the same directory
            as VH.EXE.  You must be running Windows 95 to use 
            this feature.

        "L" to switch between different screen line modes.  You can
        display 25 lines, 28, 30, or 50 on a VGA monitor.

        "U" to use underlined hypertext links (not always possible)

        "O" to open another file.

        "C" to bring up a menu for copying text to the clipboard.
            (Requires Windows to be running, otherwise inactive)

        "I" to display basic information about this program

        Alt-C : toggle between different display color sets.

        Alt-P : toggle bottom prompt line on and off.

        Alt-T : toggle top title bar on and off.

        Alt-S : to see the HTML source.

        "Q" or Alt-X or Esc to quit the program altogether.

        Left arrow or Alt-left arrow  - move back to a recently 
        visited link.

        Right arrow or Alt-right arrow - move forwards to a 
        recently visited link.

        Spacebar: Scroll line down or page down, depending on setting
        in the .INI file.  Default is scroll line down.

        PgUp/PgDn, Home/End.
