
      The FAR File and Archive Manager
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      What's new in latest version
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   FAR 1.50 beta

     1. Character tables and keyboard macros storing format is changed
        in the registry to make adding new tables and macros from .reg
        files easier. FAR will convert registry settings itself, when
        starting first time.

        KOI-8 and CP-1251 do not installed more by default.
        To install desired table you need to enter to Addons\Tables
        folder and press Shift-Enter on corresponding .reg file.

        Options "Esc toggles panels", "Del removes files",
        "BS changes folder", "Space selects files" and
        "Use numpad keys in command line" are removed from
        "Interface settings" dialog. You can find corresponding
        macros in Addons\Macros folder.

     2. New "Commands" menu items "File view history" and "Folders history".

        New "System settings" options "Save folders history" and
        "Save view and edit history".

     3. Entering any alphanumeric letter in viewer will activate
        search dialog with this letter. Space can be used to
        continue search.

     4. View mode settings:

        a) added "Case sensitive sort" option;

        b) separate column types and widths settings for panel status
           line;

        c) removed "Detailed status line" option.

     5. Archiver plugin:

        a) 'W' modifier can be used after %%f variable.
           In such case it will be replaced with file name
           without path;

        b) '*' modifier forces '*' mask usage to select all files.
           This modifier overrides "All files mask" parameter for
           single archiver command;

        c) View operation will be continued even if archiver returned
           non-zero errorlevel when extracting file;

        d) Alt-F6 command extracts selected files to the current folder;

        e) InstallShield archives description is added to custom.ini.
           You need to have icomp.exe to work with them;

        f) Default archiver commands for .tar is changed to GNU tar
           format.

     6. FTP plugin:

        a) FTP host name can be entered in 'host:port/folder' format,
           where 'folder' is user home folder. Previous format
           also is supported;

        b) "Upload uppercase files in lowercase" configuration
           option. Forces converting of uppercase names to lowercase
           while uploading them to server;

        c) 'Default password' configuration field allows to
           define password, which will be proposed when entering
           new host parameters. It also will be used for anonymous
           logins, if password is not entered;

        d) New FTP parameters item: 'FTP description'.
           You can enter short FTP description here;

        e) Enter in FTP list will start connection process
           immediately. Press Ctrl-Enter to copy host parameters
           to connection dialog without starting connection;

        f) To connect to FTP you can also enter ftp://<hostname>
           in FAR command line;

        g) Uppecase file names do not converted more to lowercase
           when displaying.

     7. New panel settings option: "Allow reverse sort modes".
        If this option is on and current file panel sort mode
        reselected again, reverse sort mode will be set.
        Such FAR behaviour was default in previous versions too,
        but now using this option you can disable it.

     8. Alt-Left and Alt-Right scrolls long file names
        and descriptions in file panel. It works only with
        non-numpad Left and Right keys.

     9. Editor:

        a) Ctrl-F7 - replace;

        b) Auto-indent mode can be switched on from
           the "Editor setting" dialog.

        c) Ctrl-Shift-Left and Ctrl-Shift-Right combinations
           can be used to select words;

        d) Ctrl-Up scrolls editor screen up, Ctrl-Down - down.

    10. "Autodetect character table" option in viewer and editor.
        To activate this feature you also need to install all desired
        character tables and table with characters distribution
        information for your language from the "Addons/Tables"
        folder of FAR package.

    11. It is possible to add descriptions to file associations.

    12. Ctrl-Up and Ctrl-Down in dialog edit control display
        history menu. If you wish to disable it, for example,
        due to security reasons, use "History in dialog edit
        controls" option in "Interface settings".

    13. In the command line "CD" command can be used to change
        plugin file system folder as before, but "CHDIR" always
        treats the specified parameter as real folder name regardless
        a current file panel type.

    14. Ctrl-End at the end of the command line can be pressed
        several times to search for all commands, starting
        from the current command line contents. In the previous
        version it was possible to find only first such command.

    15. Additional macro settings can be entered if macro recording
        is started or finished with Ctrl-Shift-. instead of Ctrl-.
        By default screen output is disabled while executing macro.

    16. Screen output speed is increased.

    17. Added command line switch /A, which disables displaying
        of characters with codes 0 - 31. It can be useful when
        executing Far under telnet.

    18. Ctrl-W (Task list) also can be used in viewer and editor.

    19. Folder shortcuts can be used in archives and FTP client.

    20. "Find file" dialog:

        a) "Table" button;

        b) "Use all installed character tables" option;

        c) "Search in selected folders" option.

    21. Ctrl-Shift-Tab switches to previous viewer/editor/panels screen.

    22. Ctrl-<Gray +> can be used in screen grabber to add selected
        area to current clipboard contents.

    23. Plugins API (for plugin developers only):

        a) it is possible to use Ctrl, Alt and Shift key combinations
           as BreakKeys in Menu function. Read plugins.hlp for details;

        b) OPIF_EXTERNALGET, OPIF_EXTERNALPUT, OPIF_EXTERNALDELETE and
           OPIF_EXTERNALMKDIR flags can be specified in GetOpenPluginInfo
           function.

        c) struct ArcInfo format in second-level archiver plugins
           is slightly changed, though still compatible with
           previous version. Look to fmt.hpp for details;

        d) new operation mode flag OPM_TOPLEVEL;

        e) new FAR service functions: Viewer, Editor and CmpName;

        f) new field in PluginInfo structure: CommandPrefix.
           New field in OpenPluginInfo structure: ShortcutData.
           New flags in OpenPlugin function: OPEN_SHORTCUT,
           OPEN_COMMANDLINE.

        g) new dialog item flag: DIF_HISTORY;

        h) new message flag: FMSG_LEFTALIGN;

        i) new flag PPIF_SELECTED;

        j) new Control() function commands:
           FCTL_GETCMDLINE, FCTL_SETCMDLINE,
           FCTL_SETSELECTION, FCTL_SETANOTHERSELECTION;

        k) added StatusColumnTypes and StatusColumnWidths fields
           to PanelMode structure;

        l) in GetFiles and PutFiles functions now it is recommended
           to return -1 instead of 0, if function was interrupted
           by user;

        m) in documentation:

           - removed superfluous parameter hPlugin in GetPluginInfo
             function;

           - incorrect return type 'int' of SetStartupInfo changed
             to 'void'.

    24. Corrected a few bugs.
