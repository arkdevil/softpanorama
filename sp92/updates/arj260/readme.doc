   This software as originally released by ARJ Software, Inc. came "sealed"
   in an ARJ self-extracting archive with an ARJ-SECURITY envelope to
   prevent tampering.  Re-archival of this software will destroy this
   security feature "seal".


   MAJOR FEATURES OF ARJ INCLUDE:

   Windows 95 long filename support in ARJ and REARJ.

   The ability to process and archive up to 65,000 files at one time.

   The ability to store many different backups (chapters) within a
   SINGLE archive and restore any specific backup.

   ARJ provides excellent file compression in terms of resulting archive
   size and speed.

   ARJ has the option to create multiple volume archives with one
   command making ARJ useful for making backups to multiple floppies or
   archiving a very large file to several floppies without "SLICE"ing.

   A myriad of commands and options to provide ummatched flexibility in
   archiver usage.
