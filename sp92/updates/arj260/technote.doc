     ** IMPORTANT NEWS ****************************************************

     Some archiver support programs have designed ARJ archive
     identification schemes that are not reliable.  At ARJ 2.50, there
     are now three versions of the ARJSFX self-extraction module.  The
     18K byte ARJSFX module and the larger ARJSFXV module support
     ARJ-SECURITY.  The standard 16K byte ARJSFX module does NOT support
     ARJ-SECURITY.  For the first time, the ARJ-SECURITY fields in the
     main ARJ header are publicly defined.

     In addition, the main ARJ header in self-extracting archives MAY NOT
     immediately follow the EXE module now.

     ARJ has used the same ARJ archive identification scheme since ARJ
     1.0.  The following is the algorithm:

     (1) find the ARJ header id bytes 0x60, 0xEA,
     (2) read the next two bytes as the header record size in bytes,
     (3) if the record size is greater than 2600, go back to the header
         id file position, increment the file position, and go back to
         step (1),
     (4) read the header record based upon the previous byte count,
     (5) calculate the 32 bit CRC of the header record data,
     (6) read the next four bytes as the actual header record CRC,
     (7) if the actual CRC does not equal the calculated CRC, go back
         to the header id file position, increment the file position,
         and go back to step (1).

     It is acceptable to start this identification algorithm at a point
     just after the ARJ self-extraction EXE portion of an archive.  This
     algorithm is fully demonstrated in the UNARJ C source code. A portion
     of that source code is excerpted at the end of this document.

     As of ARJ 2.10, the SFX executable modules are pre-compressed
     using LZEXE.  This may cause false indications with EXE scanning
     programs showing that an ARJ SFX archive is a LZEXE compressed
     file.  Only the executable header module is LZEXE compressed.
     The actual archive is ARJ compressed, of course.  The LZEXE
     header is modified to avoid extraction by UNLZEXE type programs.
     UNLZEXE may truncate an ARJ self-extractor of its archive.

     All SFX modules have an identification string located in the
     first 1000 characters of the executable.  The identification
     string is "aRJsfX" without the quotes and in the exact case.

     When using listfiles with ARJ, ARJ support programs should use the
     "-p" option to ensure that ARJ will only extract the selected files
     from an ARJ archive.  In addition, the listfiles should contain the
     full pathname information as stored in the ARJ archive.  This avoids
     the problem accessing files that have the same filename but different
     paths.

     There is an extended header bug in older versions of ARJ, AV.C and
     UNARJ.C.  The extended header processing in read_header() should
     skip 4 bytes for the extended header CRC and not 2.  This is NOT a
     current problem as no versions of ARJ use the extended header.

     ARJ archives contains three types of header blocks:

        Archive main header - This is located at the head of the archive
        Local file header   - This is located before each archived file
        Chapter header      - This is usually located each series of
                              chapter files.
