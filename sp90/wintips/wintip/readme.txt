» ABOUT THIS HELP FILE:
=======================
New users and experienced users of Windows 95 alike can benefit 
from the contents of this help file.  Perhaps you have seen other 
Windows 95 compilations with so called "Tips and Tricks."  This 
one is just a little bit different.  With the exception of a few 
entries in this help file, most of the information cannot be 
found by using Windows 95 from day to day.  Other "Tips and 
Tricks" resources usually tend to dwell on simple things that most 
people will eventually figure out.  One of the goals of this help 
file is to avoid that redundant approach to getting the most out 
of Windows 95.

For information on some of the more basic features of Windows 95, 
refer to the text file 'tips.txt', which is located in the Windows 
directory (i.e., c:\windows).

The author of this help file is not responsible in any way for any 
type(s) of unwanted result(s) from the use of the tips, tricks, 
and/or secrets obtained from this help file.

» VIEWING THIS HELP FILE:
=========================
You should be able to view Windows 95 Tips, Tricks, and Secrets
with existing software on your Windows 3.x, Windows 95, or Windows NT
computer. If you are having problems viewing this help file
(win95tip.hlp) such as seeing only garbled information, you are most
likely not viewing the help file with the appropriate program.

   Viewing this file under Windows 3.x:
   ------------------------------------
   To view the file under Windows 3.x, load up File Manager, and go to
   the directory where you originally extracted win95tip.hlp from the
   ZIP archive. At this point, you should be able to see the file by
   simply double clicking on it. If it does not load up successfully,
   it is probably not associated correctly with winhelp.exe, Windows'
   help file viewer. To associate files through File Manager, choose
   "Associate..." from the "File" menu. Then, browse for winhelp.exe, 
   which should be in your Windows directory. After associating the
   file, you should be able to view Windows 95 Tips, Tricks, and Secrets.

   Viewing the file under Windows 95 & Windows NT 4.0:
   ---------------------------------------------------
   To view the file under Windows 95 or NT 4.0, just double click on it
   from any Explorer window. If it does not load up successfully, help
   files (*.hlp) on your computer are not properly associated. To
   associate files in Windows 95 and NT 4.0, open up any Explorer window.
   Then, choose "Options..." from the "View" menu. Next, choose the
   "File Types" tab. Scroll down the list of Registered file types and
   find "Help File". Click the "Edit..." button. Under the Actions list,
   choose "open" and click "Edit...". In the second blank, enter
   c:\windows\winhlp32.exe as the application if you are running 
   Windows 95, and c:\winnt\winhlp32.exe as the application
   if you are using Windows NT 4.0 (assuming you installed Windows 95
   or Windows NT 4.0 to \windows and \winnt, respectively). After
   clicking OK to exit all of the dialog boxes, you should be able to 
   click on win95tip.hlp from any Explorer window to view the file.
