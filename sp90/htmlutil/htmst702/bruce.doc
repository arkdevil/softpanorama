                                  Introduction

This documentation provides some overview information on a number of utilities.
All programs  described  herein  were  written  by  Bruce  Guthrie.   Most  are
distributed with a Wayne Software copyright.  Others were written for the  U.S.
Department of Commerce.

All programs are free for use provided relevant documentation is kept with  the
programs, no changes are made to the programs or documentation,  and  they  are
not bundled with commercial programs or charged for separately.

CHANGE,  CONVERT,  FILUPDAT,  READ,   and   READY   are   excluded   from   the
commercial-packaging  restriction.   These  programs  are  owned  by  the  U.S.
Department of Commerce and may be re-distributed without restriction.

People who need to  bundle  AV,  BFIND,  COPSINCE,  DATES,  DIRCOMP,  DIRTOTAL,
EUMAIL, FILL, FIXTEXT, FORTUNE, HTMSTRIP, MOZ, PAGINATE, READINIT,  or  TXTABLE
in commercial packages other than shareware/freeware collections must pay a $50
registration fee to "Wayne Software" at the following address. READMAKE-created
files are also subject to this limitation.  I don't expect to  make  any  money
from  these  utilities  but  I  don't  want  others  to  sell   them   instead.
Shareware-distribution groups that charge more than $7 for a  diskette  or  $20
for a CD-ROM are, as far as I'm concerned, making excessive profits from  these
programs--their actual costs are way below this--and  probably  keeping  people
from registering the other shareware on the disk; I do not want these types  of
places distributing my programs.

This collection of utilities were compiled using Microsoft's Visual  BASIC  for
DOS 1.0 compiler in addition  to  Thomas  G.  Hanlin  III's  excellent  PBClone
routines.  Since DOS compilers and libraries  are  not  being  maintained  much
anymore, adding new data formats and such may not be possible.  Since they  are
DOS-based, forget long Win95 and WinNT file names and such.

Documentation provided in appropriate ZIP files:
 * routine.DOC: Each utility is separately  described  in  a  like-named  *.DOC
     file.
 * FILE_ID.DIZ: Standard "Description In Zip" file.
 * BRUCE.DOC: This file serves to summarize all of the various utilities.
 * BRUCEINI.DOC: Most of the routines have defaults that can altered  by  using
     initialization files (inifiles).  These  are  referenced  in  the  regular
     documentation and further described here.
 * BRUCEHEX.DOC: Many of the routines allow you to enter parameters  as  either
     hexadecimal or  decimal  strings.   This  is  referenced  in  the  regular
     documentation and further described here.
 * HISTORY.ymm: List of  recent  modifications  to  all  programs.   The  "ymm"
     indicates the release date in year/month format.  "601" means 1996,  first
     month (Jan 1996).

All program documentation was created using a text editor (PE2).  The  PAGINATE
command (see below) was used to  justify  the  text  and  create  titles,  page
breaks, and (where provided) indexes.

Please provide an Internet e-mail address on all correspondence.

Since these programs are typically "freeware" (with  the  exception  of  people
trying to make money from them instead of me), they generate maybe $100/year in
revenue for me.  As such, my ability to afford wonderful  customer  support  is
somewhat restricted.  Please  do  not  leave  messages  saying  "Call  me  long
distance".  Also, please be specific about  what  problems  you  encounter  and
include command-line inputs as well as any control or  INI  files  that  you're
using.

Beta testers and suggestions are always appreciated.  Among other things,  beta
testers receive e-mail  notification  whenever  major  enhancements  are  made.
Contact me at bguthrie@nmaa.org Note that all beta releases are done via e-mail
so if  your  gateway  can't  handle  some  pretty  big  mail  attachments,  you
definitely do NOT want to be a beta tester for me!  Modifications that are  not
of mainstream use can be contracted for.

WIN/NT AND WIN95 USERS:  All of these  programs  are  DOS  applications.   This
means that they expect 8.3 filenames, short paths, etc.  If you use long  paths
or illegal characters in your file names or whatever, these  programs  may  not
work for you.  This is not a "bug" in the software.  That's just  the  way  DOS
programs are.

STANDARD LEGAL DISCLAIMER:  Wayne Software disclaims all warranties as to  this
software, whether express or implied, including without limitation any  implied
warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, functionality,
data integrity or protection.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           Short program descriptions

NOTE:  All programs support early termination by pressing Escape.

AV.EXE: Archive directory viewer.  Presents list of files in archive (ZIP, ARC,
   etc) and lets you sort as desired.  Also allows resetting of the  file  date
   based on the archive's contents.

BFIND.EXE: Allows Boolean-type FIND requests.  For example, find any line  with
   one string AND another one, or any line with one string  OR  another.   Also
   allows wildcarded input file names.

CHANGE.EXE: Processes change commands in files.  Files can be of any  size  and
   type (binary or text) and  are  processed  quickly.   Up  to  thirty  change
   commands can be processed in a single pass.  Also provides ability to remove
   trailing spaces from text files.

CONVERT.EXE: Converts between  data  formats:   FROM   dBase,   ASCII-delimited
   (typically commas between fields and quotes around strings), and fixed field
   TO Lotus WKS,  ASCII-delimited,  dBase,  and  fixed  field.   Also  provides
   ability to add and drop fields, giving you the ability to crunch tables.

COPSINCE.EXE: Copies all files modified since a given date.  Primarily used for
   making sure you have a back-up of files and also to copy updated programs to
   another place.  Lets you define your own groupings of files if desired.

DATES.EXE: Program that warns you in advance when an  event  like  a  birthday,
   anniversary, or holiday is coming up.  The  idea  is  to  give  you  advance
   warning so you can send a card or get out of town in time.

DIRCOMP.EXE: Similar in some ways to DOS's REPLACE command but adds ability  to
   delete extra files in the destination subdirectory, copy hidden  and  system
   files, and prepare a report showing inconsistencies.  Is frequently used  by
   network administrators to update workstation files.

DIRTOTAL.EXE: Prepares report showing files in subdirectory or  drive.   Allows
   restricting search based on date, size, attributes, etc.  Works on networked
   and CD-ROM drives.  Produces more formalized report than some utilities  do.
   Also allows you to look for duplicate file names.

EUMAIL.EXE: Eudora mail summarizer.  Dumps your  Qualcomm  Eudora  mailbook  as
   well as summarizing the contents of all of your Eudora boxes and folders.

FILL.EXE: Program designed to move files off to floppy  diskettes,  taking  the
   biggest files first and skipping those that won't fit.  Also works fine  for
   transfers to/from DOS-compatible  networks,  removable  drives,  etc.   Also
   supports  splitting  large  files,  creating  a  status  report,  and  other
   features.

FILUPDAT.EXE: Program which compares a selected list of files in a source  path
   against those in another path and  copies  those  that  have  been  updated.
   Similar to DOS' REPLACE command but  works  from  a  stored  list  of  files
   (controlled updates) and can handle any number of directories.

FIXTEXT.EXE: Program which applies a user-definable character-translation table
   to a text file.  Can allow you to convert graphics characters to their  text
   equivalents, lowercase letters to uppercase letter, etc.  Can also  be  used
   to translate DOS text files to Mac or Unix text files and vice  versa.   Can
   also expand tabs, remove leading and trailing spaces, remove backspaces, and
   remove blank lines.

FORTUNE.EXE: A tuner-upper for the DOS FOR command.   Generates  a  batch  file
   which does all those wildcard things you wished FOR could do (like  "FORTUNE
   IN (*.BAS) DO RENAME %A %2*.*" to remove parts of file names).  Lets you  do
   all sorts of things including distinguishing  file  name  roots  from  their
   extensions as well as incrementing file names by specified values.

HTMSTRIP.EXE: Processes and removes  embedded  HTML  commands  from  Web  pages
   downloaded from the Web.   Reflows  paragraphs,  processes  tables,  etc  as
   straight ASCII text.  Can  function  on  individually-saved  pages  or  else
   process your entire disk cache.  Ideal tool  for  resending  via  e-mail  or
   dozens of different uses.  Awarded a "Best"  rating  by  "PC  Computing"  in
   their July 1996 issue. Includes MOZ.EXE which renames the files in your  Web
   cache subdirectory so you can identify them more easily.

PAGINATE.EXE: Reformats text files with  embedded  formatting  codes.   Handles
   things like titles, footers, indexes, alignment, justification,  multicolumn
   listings,  etc.   Also  provides  support  for  embedding  tabular  data  in
   ASCII-delimited or dBase formats which can be embedded and/or sorted in your
   reports.

READ.EXE, READY.EXE, READINIT.EXE,  and  READMAKE.EXE:   Text   file   browsing
   utilities.  READ--Supports marking, copying text, reading Unix and Mac  text
   files, etc.  Handles files of 16,000 lines or less (approx  800,000  bytes).
   READY--truncates or wraps lines over 255 characters in  length  but  handles
   files of an unlimited number of lines.  READMAKE--Takes an  ASCII-text  file
   and makes it self-viewable (using a READ clone).

TXTABLE.EXE: Program to generate text tables.  Allows inputs to  be  HTML-based
   as well as one-record per cell.
