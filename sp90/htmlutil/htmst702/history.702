HISTORY.702                         1                         Revised: 02-28-97

                                Revision history

Detailed revision histories for the programs are only maintained for  the  last
three releases.  After that, you get the major revision summaries only for  the
next three releases or so.  In any case,  if  your  version  of  any  of  these
programs is more than a year old, your version  is  definitely  obsolete.   Hop
onto the Web or e-mail me or something and get the new version!

-------------- (full detail; revisions made 1 to 3 releases ago)
Release 702 (Feb 1997):

  All programs:  Added a mention in the list of features that  pressing  Escape
  stops the programs early.  This  has  always  been  the  case  but  it  isn't
  documented on the screen for every program.

  CHANGE:  Fixed problem  with  /REPLACE  when  source  file  had  non-standard
  attribute (e.g.  hidden).  Added /ATTR=attribs parameter.  /VERIFY option was
  replacing text with the wrong thing (arghh!!!)  [Replaces chang701.zip]

  DIRCOMP:   Increased  maximum  levels  of  directories   from   10   to   20.
  Realistically, this shouldn't be an issue for most people but...  Changed  it
  so the /Xfilespec and /Nfilespec specifications applied to subdirectory names
  too if /S was used.  [Replaces dirco701.zip]

  DIRTOTAL:   Increased  maximum  level  of  directories   from   15   to   20.
  Realistically, this shouldn't be an issue for  most  people  but...   /S  and
  /SPACE options renamed as /SIZE; /D renamed  as  /DATE.   For  now,  the  old
  formats for these still work.  [Replaces dirto701.zip]

  EUMAIL:  Added quick-start  instructions  to  the  documentation.   [Replaces
  eumal701.zip]

  FILL:  Made the passing of source and destination more  consistent  with  DOS
  COPY command.  I hadn't realized that  "COPY  C:  A:"  was  acceptable  until
  someone pointed it out.  [Replaces fill701.zip]

  FIXTEXT:  Added HTMSTRIP's multiple line-type handling:  program now  accepts
  lines  that  end  with  any  combination  of  CR,  CR/LF,  CR/CR/LF,  or  LF;
  previously, every line had to end with  the  same  specification.   [Replaces
  fixtx611.zip]

  FORTUNE:  Added /SIZE, /DATE, and /ATTR=attribs specifications.  Made  it  so
  that /PROMPT works when running under  /-RUN  mode;  before,  you  were  only
  prompted if  the  commands  were  being  executed  automatically.   [Replaces
  fortn608.zip]

  HTMSTRIP:  Added support for character-translation file, allowing you to  fix
  up those ugly characters like the weird apostrophe in "Disney's".  Of course,
  page designers aren't supposed to use platform dependent characters like this
  (that's what all of those "entity references" are for) but you  know  how  it
  goes.   Changed  default  table  borders  to  be  text  instead  of  graphics
  characters (/BORDER=T over /BORDER=S).  Changed program  so  will  skip  text
  before HTML commands are encountered vs skipping the  file  itself.   Removed
  blank line between items  in  <UL>  and  <OL>  lists.   Allowed  for  skipped
  quotation marks around things like <A HREF="site"> references.  Added all  of
  the foreign characters in &#nn; form in the entity reference section.   Added
  a block in the HTMSTRIP.INI file showing how  to  override  system  defaults.

HISTORY.702                         2                         Revised: 02-28-97

  Fixed error with ROWSPAN when used on first column in a table.  Miscellaneous
  other bug fixes. In the manual:  Added quickstart instructions, moved all the
  junk  about  entity  reference  tables  and  such  to  the  end,  and   other
  miscellaneous changes. [Replaces htmst701.zip]

  PAGINATE:  Added WRAPBOL=string and WRAPEOL=string commands.  These allow you
  to print things  like  source  code  easier,  showing  you  which  lines  are
  continued. Fixed up a problem with multicolumn outputs.   Fixed  a  bug  that
  kept the sample files from working (good old temporary paths...).  Now allows
  for page ejects embedded in  the  middle  of  the  input  line.   Added  more
  examples in the beginning of the documentation.  [Replaces pagin701.zip]

  READMAKE:  Fixed bug in text searching.  [Replaces read609.zip]

  TXTABLE:  Didn't work correctly for non-HTML files since I added the  COLSPAN
  and ROWSPAN stuff; fixed.  The COLSPAN/ROWSPAN example in  the  document  did
  not work; it does now.  [Replaces txtab701.zip]

Release 701 (Jan 1997):

  All programs:  I've obtained some free Web space on the GeoCities site so the
  programs have immigrated from Norway to GeoCities.  The site name is:

        http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/2414

  Thanks a lot to Hans Schrader up there in Norway for volunteering and setting
  up the original  site!   He's  still  maintaining  the  X-Files  Registry  at
  http://hjs.geol.uib.no/xfiles/xfiles.htm

  AV:  Revised how program handles members; if fewer than 50 members,  does  it
  in memory instead of going to ISAM data bases.  Makes  it  much  quicker  for
  smaller files.  [Replaces av607.zip]

  BFIND:   Added  /ATTR=ALL  to  process  all  files.    Changed   default   to
  /ATTR=-H-S-R. [Replaces bfind612.zip]

  CHANGE:  Fixed up return code when no file is found.  [Replaces chang610.zip]

  CONVERT:  Fixed up handling of  file  type  detection  where  there  were  no
  delimiters around strings (didn't work too  well  if  you  didn't  specify  a
  control file).  Changed the default to  /SCAN=100  instead  of  /SCAN=10  for
  cases where you want the routine to guess the file type  for  you.   Modified
  the documentation to give an example of handling  ASCII-delimited  files  and
  having it guess the field definitions for you.  Minor changes to some of  the
  on-screen information.  [Replaces convr611.zip]

  DATES:  Program was showing current year instead  of  original  year;  fixed.
  [Replaces dates612.zip]

  DIRCOMP:  More work with attributes.  You may need to change batch  files  to
  do /ATTR=ALL to get all files.  [Replaces dirco612.zip]

  DIRTOTAL:  Expanded program to handle up to 999,999 files (vs 99,999) without
  going  weird.   Reformatted  on-screen  and  summary  information   somewhat.
  [Replaces dirto612.zip]

  EUMAIL:  Now scans for WEUDORA.EXE  (older  filename  for  Qualcomm's  Eudora
  program) in addition to EUDORA.EXE  (current  version).   Also  notices  when

HISTORY.702                         3                         Revised: 02-28-97

  you're running  under  an  unsupported  version  of  Eudora  (please  upgrade
  though--the new versions are great!).  Comments in the nickname file are  now
  presented in  their  original  order  instead  of  being  sorted.   [Replaces
  eumal612.zip]

  FILL:  Added /ATTR=ALL to process all files.  [Replaces fill612.zip]

  HTMSTRIP:   Now  provides  partial  support  for  COLSPAN=n   and   ROWSPAN=n
  specifications in tables.  Added tab expansion.   Added  direct  support  for
  definition lists (<DL>...<DT>...<DD>...</DL>).   Changed  program  to  accept
  lines  that  end  with  any  combination  of  CR,  CR/LF,  CR/CR/LF,  or  LF;
  previously, every line had to end with the same specification.  (Depending on
  how this effects complaints  about  performance--the  program  runs  somewhat
  slower now--this may be applied to the other programs as well.) Fixed up some
  alignment-related problems with table cells.   Finally  figured  out  how  to
  remove those extra divider row in some tables.  I liked /-FORCE so  much,  it
  is now the default value.   Enhanced  documentation  by  showing  which  HTML
  language attributes are now supported by the program.   Fixed  bug  involving
  passing  in  output  name.  Some  more  debugging  on  tables  and   <OPTION>
  selections.  Changed default file  selection  criteria  to  be  /ATTR=-H-S-R.
  [Replaces htmstr612.zip]

  MOZ (included in HTMSTymm.ZIP  file):   /WHO  and  /-WHO  operation  altered.
  On-screen counts altered.  /COPY wasn't checking for duplicate file names  on
  output like it should have; fixed.  Fixed up some problems related  to  using
  /SLIDE parameter with /COPY or /RENAME.  Reworked how the slides are  handled
  and displayed.  [Replaces htmst612.zip]

  PAGINATE:  Added MARGIN=n (or LMARGIN=n) marker command which allows  you  to
  shift the entire output by a given amount.  [Replaces pagin611.zip]

  READY:  Added the ability to reroute the output to a disk file in which  case
  a new file will be created with the wrapping in effect.  Also now  allow  the
  width to be any specification up to /WIDTH=255 so you can, for example,  have
  wrapping in effect for /WIDTH=75 if you want.  [Replaces read609.zip]

  TXTABLE:  Added /FORCE and /-FORCE parameters.  (These were actually added in
  txtab612.zip but I forgot to announce that one.)  Worked  a  bit  to  support
  COLSPAN=n  and  ROWSPAN=n  specifications  in  tables.   Most  of  the  table
  processing available  through  HTMSTRIP  works  in  TXTABLE  now.   [Replaces
  txtab611.zip]

Release 612 (Dec 1996):

  All programs:  Switched documentation to be 79 characters in  length  instead
  of 80.

  BFIND:  Added ability to specify file attributes for files searched. Added /S
  (cascading) option.   [Replaces bfind610.zip]

  DATES:  Program didn't correctly handle periods as  date  element  delimiters
  (for example, "dd.mm.yy").  Added some quickie user instructions.   [Replaces
  dates611.zip]

  DIRCOMP:  Minor  labeling  fixes.   Added  more  full-featured  /ATTR=attribs
  options.  Dropped /NET option (didn't seem to  accurately  detect  the  drive
  type anyway); relax, DIRCOMP still works identically for network maintenance!
  [Replaces dirco611.zip]

HISTORY.702                         4                         Revised: 02-28-97


  DIRTOTAL:   Added  more  full-featured  /ATTR=attribs   options.    [Replaces
  dirto610.zip]

  EUMAIL:  Decided the program wasn't user-friendly enough for  Windows  users.
  EUMAIL now automatically scans for EUDORA.EXE now along all available  drives
  and, when found, creates a EUMAIL.INI file for you  if  necessary  to  record
  this information.  Eliminated the /SCAN option  as  a  result.   Changed  the
  output subdirectory  default  from  C:\TEMP  to  whatever  your  TEMP  system
  variable is.  [Replaces eumal611.zip]

  FILL:  Changed program so /CONT option no longer  looks  at  diskette  serial
  number.  This means pre-formatted diskettes should  work  fine.   Added  more
  full-featured /ATTR=attribs options.  [Replaces fill610.zip]

  HTMSTRIP:  More bug fixing with tables.  I'm getting to hate  tables...   The
  method of writing tables has been  totally  recoded  and  the  column  widths
  should  appear  closer  to  the  desired  appearances  now.   Added   /Cpath,
  /COPY=path, /CREATE, /-FORCE, /RSPACE, /ATTR=attribs parameters.  The use  of
  /-FORCE, among other things, prevents long <PRE>..</PRE>  blocks  from  being
  reflowed. More blank lines are being eliminated by /-SPACES  now.   [Replaces
  htmst611.zip]

  MOZ (included in HTMSTymm.ZIP file):  /COPY=subdir specification didn't work;
  fixed.  Corrected  detection  of  MID  and  AU  files.   Added  detection  of
  Shockwave (*.DCR) files.   Corrected  periodic  errors  with  Mosaic  caches.
  Added /CREATE parameter.  Added return codes.  [Replaces htmst611.zip]

-------------- (kind of terse; revisions made 4 to 6 releases ago)
Release 611 (Nov 1996):

  COPSINCE:  Recoded program  to  work  more  like  DOS  REPLACE  command.   /R
  replaced by /U command.  /U, /A, /AU, /CLONE, and new  /DIFF  parameters  are
  now mutually exclusive.

  DIRCOMP:  Recoded program to work more like DOS  REPLACE  command.   /U,  /A,
  /AU, /CLONE, and new /NONE and /DIFF parameters are now mutually exclusive.

Release 610 (Oct 1996):

  DIRTOTAL:  Added /TREE parameter.

  EUMAIL:  Got around the internal vs external date format problems.

Release 609 (Sep 1996):

  Lots of programs were revised but, really, no major changes.


HISTORY.702                         5                         Revised: 02-28-97

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          Wish list & bugs to squash

Nothing in this list is guaranteed to be incorporated in the routines. However,
they may be.  Realistically, most of these have been on the list for  a  *long*
time so don't hold your breath--e-mail me if any of them mean  a  lot  to  you.
With all the revisions, I keep wondering  if  I'll  ever  have  time  to  learn
Windows programming.

If you have other suggestions, please contact me at bguthrie@nmaa.org.  Obscure
suggestions that seem useful to just a small number of people will probably  be
ignored unless accompanied by offers of money; and, yes, I can  do  specialized
versions for your own purposes on a fee basis.
