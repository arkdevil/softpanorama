<P>
January 1996 I was looking for something that would help me to build and maintain my homepage. To my surprise there were many, many editors available and they all reminded me of the new clothes of the emperor. Or worse, nice looking play-things with lots of cascading menu's and endless dialogs.
<P>
I had some free time to kill, so I started writing my own editor. Eventually, Anansi should enable my 80-year grandfather to make a homepage without needing to study all those ugly HTML-tags. Wizards don't need to be afraid, Anansi will remain serving them just as well.
<P>
Anansi is freeware and comes in two Windows flavours: 16 bits (3.x) and 32 bits (95). If you like it, I would appreciate it very much if you could get Anansi some publicity. People keep telling me get Anansi linked from sites like <A href="http://cws.wilmington.net/html.html">Stroud's</A>, <A href="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Internet/World_Wide_Web/HTML_Editors/MS_Windows/">Yahoo</A> or <A href="http://a2z.lycos.com/Internet/Web_Publishing_and_HTML/HTML_Editors_and_Converters/">Lycos</A>. Well, I've emailed them several times. Feel free to send them your recommendation. The good news is that thanks to your help Anansi got listed at <A href="http://www.tucows.com/">TuCows</A>.
