<CENTER><H1>How to set up FTP?</H1></CENTER>
<P>
FTP settings for each project are to be found under File, Project Manager and then the FTP section.. If you're new to FTP, a short explanation follows.
<P>
In this example I will use my own settings. As FTP address I use the domainname of my provider. My username for FTP is the same as the one I use for logging in with my provider. The only thing I needed to know is that I had to use a special upload directory by the name of www. Ask your own provider about your special upload directory, if there is any.

Now, that's not that hard, is it?
