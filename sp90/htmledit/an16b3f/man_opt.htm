<DL><DT><H2>Browsers</H2><DD>
<P>
Browsers opens the Browser dialog. Anansi doesn't mind testing with multiple browsers simultaneously, that's why there are checkboxes so you can check which of your installed browsers will be used while testing.

<DL><DT><H2>Font</H2><DD>
<P>
Click and select the font to be used in the editor windows.

<DL><DT><H2>Editor</H2><DD>
<P>
Editor brings up a multipaged settings dialog. Most of it is rather advanced.
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Paragraph: Should you use single style or container style paragraph tags? I don't know. I think single style does just fine. But you're welcome to change the settings to whatever you like. You can even add a few returns if you like.
<LI>Bold / Italic: Another point of discussion is the consistent use of logical tags. True html pages shouldn't contain bold and italic. Most of Anansi users couldn't probably care less, but times can change so it's configurable.
<LI>Tags Case: Some prefer all tags lowercase, others like to have the tags stand out by having them uppercase. I myself am quite happy with the suggestion of one of my users, namely to have tags uppercase and attributes lowercase. It's a matter of taste of course.
<LI>Miscelleneous: Pretty much speaks for itself. I've set the default value of the undo/ redo level to 10. That should be enough. There's a limit on the maximum somewhere. But just like the 4 Gigabyte limit of the editor the limit on undo/redo is probably far beyond the capabilities of your hardware. I think I've cut the maximum level off at 1000 to protect users

<DL><DT><H2>URL Dialog</H2><DD>
<P>
I you want to work fast, you don't need unnessesary dialogs. So I've made them optional. However, the URL dialog is helpful if you're working with frames or JavaScript messages in the statusline of your browser.
</DL>
<P>

<DL><DT><H2>Image Dialog</H2><DD>
<P>
Again, I hate dialogs but just in case you work a lot with align settings or special values for the border, Anansi offers a Image dialog.
</DL>
<P>

<DL><DT><H2>Wordwrap</H2><DD>
<P>
Some people like to have no wordwrap. Ok, it can be done.
</DL>
<P>

<DL><DT><H2>Retain Open Files</H2><DD>
<P>
Why those clumsy last opened files menu's? When you're working with webpages, you're usually working with several files simultaneously. Check Retain Open Files and all open files will automatically load the next time you start Anansi.
