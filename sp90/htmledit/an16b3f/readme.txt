Dear Webmaster,

Beta 3f is another minor upgrade removing several bugs. There are few new features as a bonus. Read the whatsnew.htm for more info.

For upgraders from Beta 3c: The htm files are now in a special help subdirectory. You can safely delete the old htm files that came with Anansi Beta 3c and that can be found in the same directory as anansi.exe.

The an32*.zip packages contain the 32 bit version of Anansi. The 32 bit version does not work under Windows 3.11, even if you have 32S installed. For Windows 3.11 you need the an16*.zip package.

Please report problems or suggestions to Harry Bosma by email to hbosma@xs4all.nl. You're also welcome to visit the homepage for more info on new features and new releases: http://www.xs4all.nl/~hbosma/anansi/index.html
