<CENTER><H1>Quick Tutorial</H1></CENTER>
<P>
<H2>Starting a new HTML document</H2>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Start up Anansi and select File| New Project File from the pull-down menu. If you don't want to use the Project Manager you can select File| New File. A new and blank window should appear.
<P>
<LI>To add the basic structure to the document, select Assistants| Basic Structure. The cursor should appear in between the title tags.
<P>
<LI>Now you can type the title of this document. The title should be chosen with care, as it will be used for bookmarking by visitors of your homepage. The title will also appear in the caption of your browser when it loads the document. If you have your browser installed, you can check this by selecting File| Test. You'll need to give the filename when you haven't saved it already.
<P>
<LI>Everything else you want to add, needs to go in between the body tags.
</OL>

<H2>Adding some content</H2>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Remember, have the cursor placed somewhere between the body tags. To begin  you might like to start with a heading. Suppose you want to use H1. You can either click the H1 button or select Tags| Header| 1 Top Level from the pull-down menu.
<P>
<LI>After the heading, you can insert a paragraph tag to indicate you want to skip a line. You can either use Tags| Paragraph| Paragraph or the shortcut by pressing the Ctrl key simultaneously with the letter P.<BR>If you prefer starting a new line without skipping one, you should use the Line Break tag. Either select Tags | Paragraph| Line Break or use the shortcut Ctrl + L.
<P>
<LI>Finally you might like to add a graphic. To insert a graphic select Tags| Hyperlinks| Image or click the button with the mountain and blue sky. A standard Windows filedialog will appear. After you've made your choice, the cursor will return to the Alternative Text attribute. Don't forget to type something there for the many people that use  a text-only mode to visit your homepage.<BR>
The Height and Width attributes you see when it's a gif file, will help some browsers to speed up their display while loading your document. By the way,  on the internet your choice is limited to gif and jpg files.
</OL>
<P>
<H2>Adding some <FONT SIZE="+4" COLOR="#FF0080"><I>spice</I></FONT></H2>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The Document Assistant will help you set your own color settings for the document. Select Assistans| Document Colors. A sort of wysiwyg window will appear. Don't be frightened by the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Red</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#00C000">Green</FONT> and <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Blue</FONT> editing boxes, they're only meant for fine-tuning. Press the Chart button to get a chart of all the colors you can dream of.
<P>
<LI>The same thing can be done with selected pieces of text. You select text by holding the left mouce button down and then drag it. After you selected the text you want to color, choose Assistants| Font Color.
</OL>
<P>
<H2>Making hyperlinks</H2>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The easiest way to make a link is available when you have Netscape up and running. When you press Anansi's right mouse button and then select the Get URL item, a link to the currently showing page will be added. It's like pressing the Add Bookmark item in Netscape.
<P>
<LI>Even easier but only if you're running Anansi under Windows 95: you can drop Internet Shortcuts. If you don't know what they are, try making one by pressing the right mouse button in your browser's window. It will all get clear to you then.
<P>
<LI>And now linking the hard way. You can also add a link by filling in the URL tag yourself. Select Tags| Hyperlinks| URL or press the button with the chain or press Ctrl simultaneously with the letter U. What will appear is:<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>&lt;A HREF=""&gt;&lt;/A&gt;</B></FONT></CENTER>
<P>The cursor will appear in between the tags. This is where the description of the link has to go. The actual adress of the link has to go between the quotes of the HREF attribute. A link to  Anansi's homepage will look like:<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>&lt;A HREF="http://www.noord.bART.nl/~har2312/anansi.html"&gt;Anansi&lt;/A&gt;</B></FONT></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>Last but not least, linking to one of your own pages can probably be done without the http://blabla stuff. You can use so called relative linking instead. If you were to keep all your files in the same directory, a link to a document called aboutme.html would look like:<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1"><B> &lt;A HREF="aboutme.html"&gt;About me&lt;/A&gt;.</B></FONT></CENTER>
