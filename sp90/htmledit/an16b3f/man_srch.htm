Here's one of the features where having a Project Manager pays off. Anansi can do Search and Replace at three levels:
<P>

<OL>
<LI> On the currently focussed document only.
<LI> On all opened documents.
<LI> On all documents in the project.
</OL>
<P>

Replace actions can be done with and without confirmation. Replacing without confirmation for all files in the project will autosave each file that has been changed if something has been replaced, except for files that are opened in the editor. Replace actions will never autosave opened files.
