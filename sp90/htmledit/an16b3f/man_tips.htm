<DL><DT><H2>Off-line browsing</H2><DD>
<P>
The standard settings of most browsers will force you to use on-line browsing.  You might prefer the off-line settings when you're developing your own homepage. Some examples on how to adjust these settings:
<UL>
<LI>Netscape: Select Options| Network Preferences... and then (in the Cache section) set Verify Documents to never.
<LI>Mosaic: Select Option| Preferences... and then (also in the Cache section) uncheck the Check Modification Date From Server.

<DL><DT><H2>Letting the User Defined Tags do the work</H2><DD>
<P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD>
<IMG src="usertag2.gif" height="260" width="188"></TD>
<TD valign=top>If you find yourself repeating the same sequences of tags over and over again, it's time to take a look at the User Defined Tags.
<P>

On the left you can see an example of how the User Defined Tags can be used for defining sets of tags you often use. That can be special font colors combined with tags for bold, italic or underline. You could stash away specific types of tables you use often. Or you could store a few headers with the center tags added.
<P>

You get the idea?

<DL><DT><H2>Testing with different browsers</H2><DD>
<P>
Perfectionists will want to make sure that their pages look great at whatever browser. I'm such a perfectionist and I sometimes like to test my pages with Netscape and Mosaic simultaneously. You can do that with Anansi, just select Options| Browsers... and check the browsers you want to use.
<P>
If you want to minimize the traffic to your pages I advise to test with MSIE only. Only owners of a 32 bit Windows platform can run MSIE. Most Windows users are still on 16 bit and many will stay there until a really serious need for upgrading their hardware arrives. Almost 40% of your potential visitors use completely different platforms. If you want to see some figures on platforms or browsers, I suggest you visit sites like <A href="http://browserwatch.iworld.com/report-table-browsers.html">BrowserWatch</A>.

<DL><DT><H2>Use html, not htm</H2><DD>
<P>
Use html as extension of your filenames even if you're linking to your own pages. When you're working under Windows 3.x, you can test your local links off-line just as well while using the correct extension. And if you use Anansi's Upload Manager, htm extensions will rename automatically to html.<BR>
It's different if you're working under Windows 95. You still should use html but as the 16 bits version of Anansi  doesn't support long filenames, testing you're local links will fail. That's why this manual breaks the rule of using html. I decided that the manual of Anansi 16 should work under Windows 32 too. Of course, if you only work with Windows 95 and have abandoned Windows 3.x all together, you should use the 32 bits version of Anansi if you aren't already.

<DL><DT><H2>Use meta tags</H2><DD>
<P>
To help search engines classify your page you should use meta tags. Ideally they should be put somewhere between the head tags. You'll find them in Anansi's Tags | Comments menu: description and keywords. The contents of description will be displayed by more and more searchengines as a resume of your page. The entries in the keywords tag will be used for additional indexing. Usually you shouldn't repeat words that are already in the description tag, that's just waste of space.

<DL><DT><H2>Aligning images</H2><DD>
<P>
Advanced browsers like Netscape can stream text along images. You need to insert either align=left or align=right in the images tag. Be careful however, I've seen professionals mess up pages with these attributes. What looks fine in a 800x600 window can be unbearable trash in a smaller window.<BR>
A related feature is the spacing around the image. You can override the default settings by adding hspace and vspace values to the image tag. Ie &lt;img hspace=0 and vspace=0 src="image.gif"&gt; will remove any space between the image and text.

<P>
While surfing the internet you'll likely to find some interesting lay-out tricks. You can have a look at how it's been done by viewing the source. And you can always save the file and check it later. Viewing the source:
<UL>
<LI>Netscape: Select View| Document Source.
<LI>Mosaic: File| Document Source.
</UL></DL>
