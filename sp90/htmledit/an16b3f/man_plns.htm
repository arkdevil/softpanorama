<P>
There's going to be a final version 1.0 very soon. This version 1.0 will be a polished version of the version you're looking at now. I won't add significant new features to it nor do I expect many bugreports anymore. Anansi has been used and tested since february/ march 1996 and serious bugs have been very rare. I did however add some new features during the last months, like support for unlimited filesizes and a user defined tagbar. I still need to see how stable they are.
<P>
A version 2.0 is already underway and will add wysiwyg features and other goodies that will easily double the codesize of Anansi. In short, Anansi 2.0 will have all the features that would slow down 'Fast' Anansi version 1.0 too much.
<P>
I rearrange the priorities for new features very often. Here's my latest list for Anansi 2.0:
<OL>
<LI>Wysiwyg editing for tables.
<LI>Integrated browser that will enable general wysiwyg editing.
<LI>Document outline giving an overview of the objects in a document: links, anchors, frames, images, tables.
<LI>Syntax highlighting.
<LI>Frames Assistant.
<LI>URL checker that will make an inventory of links that time out, don't exist anymore or have moved.
<LI>Conversion of ascii to html.
</OL>
