The upgrades with letters are basically bugfixes. However, there are a few minor new features.

<UL>
<LI>Third-party applications can be launched from within Anansi. This means you have fast access to your favorite graphics application, HTML helpfile, imagemap editor and so on. To set things up choose Options | Launching. After the first installed application a new Tools menu will appear which will show your requested items.
<LI>The colorbar has changed. You still get your favorite colors by clicking the right mouse and then selecting up to 16 colors in the standard Windows color dialog. New is that you need to drag colors to the editor instead of just clicking. I find this approach more intuitive. Also new is getting colors displayed by doubleclicking on colorvalues in the document. The selected colorvalue will show in the statusbar just left from the colorbar. You can drag the displayed color to the colorbar, which effectively comes down to adding colors already used in documents to the colorbar. The colorbar is a <EM>work in progress</EM> and eventually will be intelligent enough to add the appropriate attributes when needed.
<LI>The colorbar has been partly added to the Table Assistant. You can drag colors to the rows. The Table Assistant is a <EM>work in progress</EM> too, in a next version dragging and dropping colors will be possible with and among row and cells.
<LI>The Project Manager now lets you define a dedicated directory for the template files. This directory will be used as default directory fir File | Insert File.
<LI>A field for a message in the statusbar when the mouse leaves the hyperlink has been added to the URL Dialog. The display of this message depends on Netscape 3.0 and compatible JavaScript. MSIE 3.0 JavaScript will not do in this case.
<LI>Rightclicking while the cursor is in an image, hyperlink or horizontal rule tag, will bring up the corresponding dialog. No need to worry about unrecognized attributes, Anansi doesn't touch things it doesn't understand.
</UL>

Then there are some minor improvements.

<UL>
<LI>The tabs under the statusbar show only the bare filename, that is with the extension stripped. It didn't make sense to spoil space on something that's most likely to be the same .htm/.html extension.
<LI>Testing with browsers first brings the browser to the foreground, then requests the page to be loaded. Previous versions did this the other way around. This is a cosmetic improvement, it looks faster but it really isn't.
</UL>

Almost last but certainly not least, here's the list with bugfixes.

<UL>
<LI><FONT color=#"ff0000" size="+2">Important</FONT>: Under certain circumstances Anansi was sending the encrypted password to the FTP server. This problem is solved. But to be on the safe side I also added uuencoding on top of the encryption, to prevent obscure problems with saving encrypted data to the ini-file. The consequence is that everyone needs to reenter the password(s).My apologies for the inconvenience.
<LI>A whole range of errors stayed behind while rearranging Anansi's sourcecode for the wysiwyg version. Flawless in versions before Beta 3e and fixed again in Beta 3f: bugs related to Get URL, Anchor, Image sizes, the HTMtoHTML switch, Help| Index menu.
<LI>The colorbar reordered the Red, Green, Blue components. This has been fixed.
</UL>

This whatsnew.htm is a new document, to be added in the <EM>help</EM> subdirectory to Anansi. Two documents have changed:

<UL>
<LI>The page on <A href="man_sst.htm">The Assistants</A> has been debugged, the first image was linked absolutely according to the directorystructure on my machine. I've made it relative so you can view the image too.
<LI>Added one tip to the <A href="man_tips.htm">Tips and Hints</A> page.
</UL>



<a href="manual.htm">Return to the index</a>
