Insert enables you to work with template files. This means you use files with standard components like headers, footers, disclaimers, forms, etc and simply insert them in existing files you've opened in the editor. The insertion will take place at the position of the cursor.

<P>
Test sends the currently focussed document to the browser. If your browser isn't running is will be started. If it is running, Anansi simply requests your browser to load the page. If something seems to go wrong, you should check Options | Browsers if the browser of your choice has been installed properly with Anansi.

<P>
Upload fires up the Upload Manager and will help you publish your page on the internet. The Upload Manager is a FTP client enhanced with some intelligence. If you're using the Project Manager, the Upload Manager knows which files to upload to your internet provider's server. These files will be preselected. You can change the selection by adding or removing files. If you're ready to go, just press upload and wait for the <I>all files have been uploaded message</I>.
<P>

While uploading you'll be able to track progress by watching the preselected files window go empty or by following the messages in the logwindog at the bottum. Large files will enable the ByteCounter. You're average html file will be send over so fast that it nearly takes any time at all. You're just waiting for the exchange of commands between client and server.
