- - - Removing Anansi - - -

Anansi installs without making a mess of your harddisk. You'll find all the Anansi files in the directory where you installed Anansi. Delete this directory and you're done. That is, assuming you've given Anansi a directory of its own. So here's the filelist:

Anansi directory:
anansi.exe
readme.txt
remove.txt
anansi.ini
table.ini
tagsman.ini
user.ini
p*.ini
Help subdirectory:
man*.htm
whatsnew.htm
*.gif

The only other thing you have to do is to remove links from the program manager and if you're on Windows 95 also any other shorcuts that have been made.

Hope this helps,
