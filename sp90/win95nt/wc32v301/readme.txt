What is Windows Commander?

Windows Commander is a file manager for Windows  similar to the Windows file
manager WINFILE.EXE. But Windows Commander uses a different approach: it has two
fixed windows, which makes copying files much easier. Wincmd exists in two
versions, 16 and 32 bit. While the 16-bit version runs fine also in 32-bit 
Windows, the 32-bit version cannot be used in Windows 3.1.

Windows Commander is shareware. The shareware version is freely distributable, 
as long as it is unchanged!

Here some key features of Windows Commander:

- Long filename support in Windows 95 and Windows NT (16 and 32 bit version)
- Supports Drag & Drop with the mouse
- 32bit: Drag&drop from and to explorer and the desktop.
- Extended copying, moving, renaming and deleting of entire trees.
- Archives are handled like subdirectories. You can easily copy files
  to and from archives. The appropriate archiver program is automatically
  called. Pkzip, arj, lha, rar and uc2 are all supported.
- Start menu (User-defined commands).
- Configurable button bar.
- Command line for the simple starting of programs with parameters.
- Enhanced search function with full text search even inside archives.
- Built in file viewer (F3) to view files of ANY SIZE in hex, binary or text
  format, using either the ASCII- (DOS) or the ANSI- (Windows) character set.
- Internal Unzip by Info-Zip
- Internal Un-ARJ and Un-LZH.
- Internal ZIP packer.

Removing Windows Commander: If you remove the program, also delete the files
wincmd.ini and noclose.pif in your Windows directory!

Installation BY HAND: Just copy the files to a directory on your hard disk.
Rename the files install.bin and installe.bin to install.zip and installe.zip
and unzip them with pkunzip -d. Then move all files with the extension .pif
into your Windows directory. Place the file ctl3dv2.dll in your windows\system 
directory. There must NOT be any copy of ctl3dv2.dll in any other directory
than the windows or system directory!!!
