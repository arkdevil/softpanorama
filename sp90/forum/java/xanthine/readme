This is version 1.0 of the Xanthine Java collection
class library, May 1996.  It contains algorithms for
handling lists, trees, bit maps, sets, and so on.
There are also sorting and searching classes.

Installation instructions:

1.  You must use a 32-bit unzip utility.

2.  Create a directory "Xanthine" (case is important),
and copy all the *.class files to it.  The unzip
utility may do this step for you.

3.  Add the directory containing "Xanthine" to your
CLASSPATH environment variable setting.  For example,
if Xanthine is found in C:\TMP\Xanthine, then you'd
add C:\TMP to your CLASSPATH.

4.  Xanthine represents a Java package and must be
set up in this way to work correctly.
