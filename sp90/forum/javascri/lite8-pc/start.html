	<b>Lite 8</b> is a JavaScript implementation of 
	<a href="http://www.worldonline.nl/~freeling/Non-Chess/MiniMancala.html">MiniMancala</a>,
	the Noughts & Crosses of the Mancala family.
	It's a board game for two players, and can be played
	against another person, the computer, or all by itself. 
	<br>
	It's also a nice example of what can (and can't) be done 
	with JavaScript.
	<p>
	<a name="play Lite 8">Before you play Lite 8</a>, take a minute to look at

		There are two players, North and South. Any player starts. Players move - and must move - in turn. Each player controls the two pits on his side. On his turn a player picks up <EM>all&nbsp;</EM>beads of one of his <EM>own&nbsp;</EM>pits, and distributes them <EM>one by one&nbsp;</EM>over the <EM>other three pits&nbsp;</EM>going in a <EM>anti-clockwise&nbsp;</EM>direction.<BR>
		So, if a cup contains more than 3 beads, the fourth bead will fall in the same cup as the first.<BR>
		If a player <EM>on his turn&nbsp;</EM>finds both his pits empty, he has lost.<P>
		Like Noughts & Crosses, the game is a determined draw.
