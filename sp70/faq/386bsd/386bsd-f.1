Section 1. (General Network Information)
General information

	This section of the FAQ is about the electronic support network 
	that exists for 386bsd and its off-spring.  

1.0	What is 386BSD? (Taken from the original INSTALL.NOTES by the 
	Jolitz's, specifically Lynne)

	Welcome to 386BSD Release 0.1, the second edition of the 386BSD 
	operating system created by William and Lynne Jolitz.  Like its 
	predecessor, 386BSD Release 0.0, Release 0.1 comprises an entire 
	and complete UNIX-like operating system for the 80386/80486-based 
	AT Personal Computer.

	386BSD Release 0.1 is an enhanced version of the original release 
	done by William F. Jolitz, the developer of 386BSD.  386BSD 
	Release 0.0 was based on the Networking Software, Release 2 from 
	the University of California at Berkeley EECS Department, and 
	included much of the 386BSD work done earlier by Bill and 
	contributed by us to the University. The latest release, 386BSD 
	Release 0.1, contains new work by the developer and many new items 
	which have been freely contributed by other software developers 
	for incorporation into 386BSD (see the file CONTRIB.LIST).  These 
	contributions have increased the functionality and made it more 
	robust.  As a courtesy to the developer and the many people who 
	have generously contributed these software enhancements, we request 
	that users abide by and properly maintain all attributions, 
	copyrights, and copylefts contained within this release.

 	386BSD is intended to foster new research and development in 
 	operating systems and networking technology by providing this base 
 	technology in a broadly accessible manner.  As such, like its 
 	predecessor, 386BSD Release 0.1 is freely redistributable and 
 	modifiable.
 
1.0.1	What are these other Free BSD systems?

	For reasons best left to private E-Mail, there have been two 
	different 'product lines' that have been established for 
	development of BSD systems.  They are NetBSD and FreeBSD.  Both,
	individually, have virtually deprecated the original 386bsd.
	The "raison d'etre" for each is different and each has a different
	set of goals.  The purpose for FreeBSD is to develop a stable 
	working environment for [3-9]86 systems.  The emphasis has been 
	on upgrading utility programs and incorporating changes that make
	the system more stable.

	NetBSD, on the other hand, is a development effort whose main 
	thrust is on mulitple platform support and staying more current
	with BSD 4.4.  In other words, NetBSD is more 'horizontal' and
	FreeBSD is more 'vertical'. 

	Both systems are excellent choices for the casual user or people
	who are interested in studying the internals of an operating 
	system.  While the products are nearly commercial quality, they 
	are both maintained by volunteers.


1.0.2	I just downloaded all of 386bsd version 0.1 and I can't get
	[some feature] to work?  Do you have any suggestions?

	Yes.  Get either FreeBSD or NetBSD.

	The original 386BSD software was kind of buggy when it was put 
	up for anonymous FTP in 1992.  It has been modified significantly
	since then, and now exists in two different forms.  There are people
	who will argue that the original 386BSD was completely unusable,
	but that is generally an overstatement.  

	Over 100 patches were applied to the original system, with hundreds
	more waiting in the wings.  It became just too much trouble to
	constantly have to patch the system to get it to work.  This
	'patched' version of 386bsd became FreeBSD.  Around the same
	time, a second group split off from the original 386bsd tree
	and became NetBSD.  For the primary differences, see above.

	Getting one of these two systems will provide you with a more 
	complete system, with newer utilities, and many bugs already 
	fixed.


1.1	Feature summary

	Among the many features of these systems:

	*    Floppy disk based Installation

	*    Hard drive partitioning for use with MS-DOS partitions

	*    Compressed, multivolume CPIO dump format binary/source/other 
	     distribution sets on MS-DOS floppies.  The cpio is based
	     on the GNU cpio, and is completely free of encumbering USL
	     software.
	
	*    387 support or emulation.

	*    SCSI support.

	*    (SCSI and most Mitsumi) CD-ROM support.

	*    NFS, TCP/IP and full networking.

	*    MS-DOS file system access (in newer *BSD systems).

	*    PPP and SLIP protocol support.

	*    System upgrades through Carnegie Mellon University's 'sup'
	     utility.

	*    Shared Library Support (in the newer version of both
	     NetBSD and FreeBSD.

	*    Both systems are based exclusively on Berkeley's BSD 4.4
	     Lite tape, instead of the encumbered 4.3 Net2 tape.
	     Hence, both systems are free of USL code and are freely
	     redistributable.


1.2	The future of 386BSD.

	{ This section is included for historical purposes only.  Most 
	of the information in here is either wildly out of date or just
	plain wrong.  For example, the FreeBSD statements in here imply
	that it is nothing more than 386bsd in a new coat of paint.
	Nothing could be further from the truth.  I decided to include 
	it mostly to show how far we have come... dbb }

	Forecasting the future is always a tricky business.  There is work 
	underway to implement version 0.2 of 386bsd.  In addition, many 
	people are involved in a project to put together a 386bsd version 
	(FreeBSD) which will be a complete distribution set including all 
	relevant patches and updates to new versions of many of the 
	software packages that are currently available.  It is available 
	by anonymous FTP from FreeBSD.cdrom.com

	In addition, NetBSD (a direct descendent of 386bsd) is available 
	for anonymous FTP from sun-lamp.cs.berkeley.edu.  The purposes of 
	these two apparent competitors appear to be at odds, but in 
	fact are very similar.  NetBSD has taken a 'stable, production
	quality, free OS' as one of its primary goals, where 386bsd 
	pursues the high ideal of the ultimate OS research platform.
	There is considerable cross pollination of the two.  The frequent
	debates on style and concept that appear in comp.os.386bsd.*
	are testimony to that point.  NetBSD and FreeBSD are still both
	very viable operating system alternatives, with differing goals.

	To see the Future of 386bsd as seen by Bill and Lynne Jolitz, I 
	suggest you read the INSTALL.NOTES that come with 386bsd.


1.3	386BSD software projects in progress

	The list of software projects in progress is just too volatile 
	to go into a static document like the FAQ.  Suffice it to say,
	if there is something you want to do using 386bsd; ask first to
	see what has been done.

	Folks that are interested in software projects for NetBSD 
	should contact netbsd-comments@sun-lamp.cs.berkeley.edu and
	let that mailing list know the same information.

	Folks interested in software projects for FreeBSD should contact
	the freebsd-hackers@freefall.cdrom.com mailing list and talk to
	them. 
 

1.3.1	Contacting software authors

	Whenever you are working on a port of a software package, it is 
	always a good idea to contact the original author and offer 
	whatever changes you needed to make in order to port the software.  
	That way, subsequent releases of the package may include changes 
	that allow all users of 386bsd the advantage of reusing your work 
	over and over.

	Also, once you have ported a package to *BSD, you might want to
	contact the respective *BSD teams to let them know you've completed
	it and where it may be located.

	For FreeBSD, contact:

		<freebsd-hackers@freefall.cdrom.com>

	For NetBSD, contact:

		<netbsd-comments@sun-lamp.cs.berkeley.edu.>

	If the port was a simple recompile of the source and install, a 
	note to one of the newsgroups telling the story could be considered 
	appropriate as well.  

	In keeping with that, if you find a 'bug' in 386bsd, or NetBSD, 
	or FreeBSD, or find a problem that causes you some headaches and 
	find a solution, you should contact the author of the particular 
	driver/module/program and let them know.  In addition, you could 
	also post the problem and/or fix to "comp.os.386bsd.bugs".

	Both NetBSD and FreeBSD have implemented 'bugfiler', so if you
	are connected to the net, you can use that to send out your
	bug.  See the documentation that comes with your system to find
	out more.


1.4	Minimum hardware configuration recommended

	There has been considerable debate about what the REAL minimum 
	configuration for 386bsd is.  Some would claim that it is the 
	smallest computer that an installation will succeed on.  Others 
	claim that it is the smallest usable computer (based on RAM and 
	speed constraints) and others would claim that it should be 
	based on using 'X'-windows.
 
	For specific hardware, see Section 8 (still in development).

	The smallest installable platform is an 80386, using an MGA card, 
	with at least 2Meg of RAM and a 20 Megabyte hard disk.  While not 
	all SCSI cards (especially EISA) are supported, a great many are 
	either in the base distribution or through patches.  Thanks to
	the new shared library code in FreeBSD and NetBSD, a 20Meg 
	installation should be easier now (in spite of the more advanced
	functionality) than it ever was before.

	A comfortable installation which includes source and binary 
	distributions, as well as other utilities will work in about 
	100Meg of hard drive.  

	'X' requires at least a Hercules MGA; for masochists only, from 
	what I understand.

	See section 8 for more details.


1.5	Where to get the source and binaries
1.5.1	Forms available (floppy, FTP, CD-ROM)

	386bsd is available in just about every format known to man, with 
	the possible exception of stone tablets and papyrus.


1.5.1.1 Where can I get the distribution on floppy or tape?

	Many people will copy files onto diskettes or tapes if you 
	coordinate it with them ahead of time.  In addition, many 
	companies offer 386bsd on various types of media for money.  
	Austin Code Works and others (usually advertisers in PC 
	magazines) offer the base 0.1 "official" distribution for a fee.
	  
	Note that there are virtually no restrictions on distributing 
	the 386bsd distributions.  Basically, wherever you can find it, 
	you can get it.  This goes for FreeBSD and NetBSD as well.


1.5.1.2 Where can I get the distribution via FTP?

	If you are looking for the original 386bsd version 0.1, the 
	files you should look for specifically when using FTP are 
	directories called srcdist, bindist, and etcdist.  These 
	directories will hold the files for each of the distributions.  
	Once you have received the files via FTP, you can either load 
	them directly onto your system and then un archive them using 
	'extract' or one of the other methods suggested in Section 2 of 
	the FAQ, in the section about installing with 'real partitioning'.
	
	The list of sites that have 386BSD is covered in section 1.8 below.  
	This list is produced automatically by using a utility called 
	'archie' and is updated for every new version of the FAQ.  If you 
	try to access a site from this list and find that they either 
	don't have FTP enabled, or don't have 386bsd loaded any more, 
	a polite letter to the admin of the system asking them to 
	update their 'archie' entries is good manners.
	
	
1.5.1.3 Where can I get the distribution on CD ROM?
	
	Infomagic sells a UNIX CD-ROM that has 386BSD.  Their FAX number 
	is 609-683-5502.

	Profit Press has 386BSD dated 7/21/92 on their "Mega Win OS/2" 
	CD-ROM.  This is in the format of BINDIST, ETCDIST, SRCDIST and 
	BOOTABLE.

		Profit Press
		2956 N. Campbell Ave
		Tucson, Arizona 85719
		(602) 577-9696
		Their order line is 1-800-843-7990

	Look for their advertisements in the back pages of Computer 
	Shopper.  The Mega series is $29.00 each or $69.00 for all three 
	plus a fourth "Demo Disk".  

	In all likelihood, the version 386bsd that is available on CD-ROM 
	will be the 0.1 version, without any patches.  Keep this in mind 
	when ordering, since the first thing most people want to do is 
	bring the system up to the current patch level.  If you do not want
	the original 0.1 version, be sure to ask where the distribution
	came from and which version of *BSD it is. 	
 
	For our European users, I have included these notes from Julian 
	Stacey (stacey@guug.de) and Christian Seyb (cs@gold.muc.de) 
	concerning locations and methods for getting 386bsd in Europe on 
	both CD-ROM and floppies.

	Lynne wrote a short follow-up, letting us know that these 
	companies do not send them any money.

	This announcement in from Jordan Hubbard:

	On the morning of 30 December, 1993, and after many many delays, 
	the first official release of FreeBSD 1.0 began shipping on CDROM.

	This CD is being sold through Walnut Creek CDROM, our ongoing 
	sponsors in the FreeBSD project, and without whom we would have had 
	a substantially more difficult (if not impossible) time producing it.


	While I will _always_ encourage obtaining FreeBSD through "free" 
	channels (the Internet, friends, suspicious individuals in dark 
	alleys), and given that none of us will make any money from CD 
	sales, or ever have from FreeBSD in general given that WC's 
	sponsorship is confined to the loan of centralized development 
	hardware and network access, I still hope that some of you will 
	find the CD distribution medium convenient enough to order a 
	FreeBSD CD from Walnut Creek, thus indirectly supporting our 
	future development work.

	If this marriage between commercial and free software interests 
	proves to be mututally beneficial (which still remains to be seen, 
	from Walnut Creek's point of view), it is my hope that it may serve 
	as a model for similar future endeavors.  It is an unfortunate fact 
	that developing free software at this scale costs money, even with 
	the developers donating their time and efforts, and financing some 
	of it through the sale of convenient distribution media is one of 
	the least venal ways I know of going about it.

	This CD contains a full FreeBSD 1.0.2 source & binary release, the
	sources and binaries for XFree86 2.0, and numerous sources from the
	FreeBSD "ports collection".  Where space permitted, sources were
	provided in both "packed" and "unpacked" forms for easy access both 
	as an on-line resource and as a source for compressed downloads in BBS
	or release-construction situations.  The CD is fully ISO9660 compatable
	and has been mastered using RockRidge extensions for long filenames on
	systems that support it (like FreeBSD! :-).

	It is, of course, possible to install the system off the CD from 
	scratch, given some basic willingness to read a little documentation 
	and a few blank floppy disks.  [ Ed Note.  You would be surprised the
	number of people that do not see this paragraph...DBB]

	For the sake of convenience, I append the ordering information 
	distilled from FreeBSD's /usr/src/RELNOTES.FreeBSD below.

	Ordering information:

        Walnut Creek CDROM
        4041 Pike Lane, Suite D
        Concord CA  94520
        1-800-786-9907, +1-510-674-0783, +1-510-674-0821 (fax)

	Or via the internet from orders@cdrom.com.  A current catalog can
	be obtained via ftp from ftp.cdrom.com:/cdrom/catalog.

	Cost is $39.95.  Shipping (per order, not per disc if ordering 
	multiple disks) is $5 in the US, Canada, or Mexico and $10.00 
	overseas.  They accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and 
	ship COD within the United States.  California residents please 
	add 8.25% sales tax.

	In addition, John Cargille publishes a CD-ROM which caters
	primarily to the NetBSD crowd.  It is called BSDisc and it is
	also available by mail.  While that may seem like terrific news,
	it is unfortunately all the information I have right now.  Once
	he sees his name in the FAQ, maybe he'll put together some real
	ordering instructions ;-)

1.6	Electronic Information Groups for 386BSD

1.6.1	Usenet newsgroups

	General BSD questions can be posted to comp.1.bsd.  Bear 
	in mind, however; that your questions to this group should 
	really be about BSD in general, not a specific implementation 
	detail of *BSD.

	Listed below are the Usenet newsgroups that were developed to 
	support 386bsd and its descendents.  This means that you should
	ask your questions in one of these newsgroups or on one of the
	many mailing lists that are available for specific features of
	said systems.

	comp.os.386bsd.announce (Moderated)
	    Announcements relating to the 386bsd operating system.
	    Posts should be mailed to "386bsd-announce@agate.berkeley.edu".
	    This is also the place that improtant news about the past
	    and future of 386bsd, FreeBSD, and NetBSD will be placed.
	    
	comp.os.386bsd.apps
	    Applications which run under 386bsd.  Not all sites will 
	    carry comp.os.386bsd.apps, since it kind of 'showed up'.
	    
	comp.os.386bsd.bugs
	    Bugs and fixes for the 386bsd OS and its clients.
	    
	comp.os.386bsd.development
	    Working on 386bsd internals.
	    
	comp.os.386bsd.misc 
	    General aspects of 386bsd not covered by other groups.
	    
	comp.os.386bsd.questions
	    General questions about 386bsd.


1.6.2	Newsgroup archives.
	
	These sites maintain a historical record of the traffic in the Usenet
	Newsgroups indicated.  There are others, but I haven't gotten their
	names yet.

1.6.3	386bsd Derived mailing lists.

	There are at least two mailing lists for 386bsd.  Both are for 
	discussions of the patchkit and patches.  Last I heard, neither
	of them is particularly active any more.  They are:

	386bsd_patchkit@cs.montana.edu: 
		This list is primarily for discussion of the patchkit and other
		patch procedure discussions.
	patches@cs.montana.edu: 
		This list is for patch submissions.

	NOTE: The patchkit is discussed in detail in Section 2 of the FAQ.
	Also, the patchkit has been effectively deprecated.  Sending to 
	these lists may or may not get you the kind of info you are looking
	for.

	In addition to the pure 386bsd lists mentioned above, there are 
	mailing lists available for FreeBSD and NetBSD.  Information about 
	the NetBSD lists and how to use majordomo (the list handler) is 
	available by mailing to majordomo@sun-lamp.cs.berkeley.edu.

	There are three mailing lists for FreeBSD and they are:

	FreeBSD-hackers: for hackers
	FreeBSD-questions: misc questions
	FreeBSD-bugs: bug reports

	Send to FreeBSD-hackers-request@freefall.cdrom.com to be added 
	to the hackers list, and *-questions-request@freefall... to be 
	added to the questions list.


1.6.4	Other electronic resources.

	There are many bulletin boards throughout the world that have 
	386bsd software and information available.   Also, there are 
	CompuServe and other on-line services that have 386bsd 
	discussions.  It is even rumored that Bill and Lynne have been
	active on Compuserve talking about 386BSD Version 1.0 (or 0.2, 
	or whatever it is going to be).
	
	    
1.6.5	System Updates.

	There are at least two different ways of getting the updates
	for the current source tree for both FreeBSD and NetBSD.  The
	first is the traditional FTP method, and the other is using a 
	utility called 'sup'.  This program keeps a log of the source 
	modules that have been updated and sends out only those files 
	that have been changed.  Included below are some sample 
	instructions from John Brezak <brezak@apollo.hp.com> on how to 
	run sup for NetBSD.  The sup procedures for FreeBSD are similar 
	and are available via ftp from freefall.cdrom.com in the 
	~/ftp/pub/sup directory.  This directory contains the sup 
	program, a man page, a sample sup-file and full instructions 
	for maintaining your sources via 'sup.


	Instructions for installing NetBSD sources and releases using SUP
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
					1.3 1993/11/3

	SUP is a network installation package written by CMU used to
	distribute software. For more details on SUP refer to the man
	pages. 

	Sup works by reading a configuration file (supfile) and using
	this information to determine what "collections" of files will
	be loaded from the collection repository.  Here is an example
	of a supfile to load the NetBSD current release.

	[ Notes: lines have been broken for readability; do NOT use '\' 
	in supfiles and the information here is an EXAMPLE.  This ain't 
	a cooking school, folks.  Also, the information in these lines
	has changed for each of the distributions.  Read the
	documentation that comes with your software carefully for the
	lastest information. ]

	src release=current host=sun-lamp.cs.berkeley.edu hostbase=/b/anon_ftp 	    base=/usr prefix=/usr backup

	ksrc release=current host=sun-lamp.cs.berkeley.edu hostbase=/b/anon_ftp 	    base=/usr prefix=/usr backup

	security release=current host=sun-lamp.cs.berkeley.edu 	    hostbase=/b/anon_ftp base=/usr prefix=/usr backup

	gamessrc release=current host=sun-lamp.cs.berkeley.edu 	    hostbase=/b/anon_ftp base=/usr prefix=/usr backup

	regress release=current host=sun-lamp.cs.berkeley.edu 	    hostbase=/b/anon_ftp base=/usr prefix=/usr backup

	#othersrc release=current host=sun-lamp.cs.berkeley.edu 	    hostbase=/b/anon_ftp base=/usr prefix=/usr backup


	This supfile will load the "current" collections for "src",
	"ksrc", "security", "gamessrc", and "regress" in the /usr
	directory on the local machine.  The "othersrc" collection will
	not be loaded because it is commented out.

	The supfile line is made up of keywords that describe the 
	collection's location on the sup server and where and how it
	will be loaded on the local host.

		release - the release of the collection to load.
        	host	- the 'host' where the SUP repository resides.
			NetBSD uses sun-lamp.cs.berkeley.edu .
        	hostbase- the pathname on the host to the base of the 
        		collection.  The hostbase for NetBSD is "/b/anon_ftp".
		base	- where you want to install it locally.
		prefix	- used to locate the "sup" directory to write sup's
			info about updates. Usually the same as base.

	This supfile can also set some options. The "old" option tells sup
	to check all files for changes, not just those that are newer than 
	the last sup update. Normally sup will overwrite local files with the
	changed file from the repository. If the sup collection specifies 
	that an existing file should be renamed to a backup, the "backup" 
	option in the supfile activates this. The "delete" option tells 
	sup to delete any files locally that are no longer in the 
	collection - be careful with this one.  The "keep" option will 
	cause sup to NOT update files that have been changes locally. 
	The "compress" option will use gzip to compress the files before 
	transfer and gunzip them on the receiving end. This option can be 
	used to cut down on the number of transmitted bytes.

	You may want to set 'base' and 'prefix' to something other than /usr
	if you want to preserve your existing src tree.

	The sup repository on sun-lamp.cs.berkeley.edu currently offers these
	collections.
       	 
		src, ksrc, security
			The sources for NetBSD

		othersrc
			The current sources for contributed parts of
			NetBSD.  This contains the sources for sup.

		regress
			The current sources for the NetBSD regression test 
			suite.

	If you only want the kernel sources for a specific port there are
	some sub packages that you can use instead of the "ksrc" one. If
	you are using the sub packages, be sure to also sup the
	"ksrc-common" package.

        	ksrc-common
                	Kernel sources common to all ports.

        	ksrc-1, ksrc-sparc, ksrc-hp300, ksrc-amiga, ksrc-mac,
        	ksrc-pc532, ksrc-pmax, ksrc-sun3
                	Kernel sources for a particular port.


	The security package is not to be sup'ed by sites outside of the 
	U. S., read the "README.export-control" file for details.

	Each collection can have multiple releases (as specified by the
	"release" keyword).

	IMPORTANT!!
	Be aware that the current release is simply a snapshot of the 
	daily state of NetBSD development and is not guaranteed to
	build (or even work) - use at your own risk !

	Stable releases of NetBSD are available via SUP.  Instructions 
	are included with the release announcement.

	Before running sup, be sure that your /etc/services contains 
	these entries.

	supfilesrv      871/tcp         # for SUP
	supfiledbg      1127/tcp

	To try sup without really updating anything use the '-f' flag.
	The '-v' flag means verbose and can be used to see what sup is 
	doing.
	
		sup -fv supfile

	The sup binary, sup man page and sample supfiles can be ftp'ed 
	from sun-lamp.cs.berkeley.edu:~ftp/pub/sup .  Comments should be 
	directed to "sup@sun-lamp.cs.berkeley.edu".

	A mailing list exists for users of the NetBSD "current"
	release.  To join, mail to 'majordemo@sun-lamp.cs.berkeley.edu'
	with a mail body of "info".  The reply will describe the mailing 
	lists for NetBSD.  The you will want to subscribe to the 
	"current-users" mailing list.  We will use this list to announce 
	any special changes made to the "current" tree.


1.7	Documentation available

	This entire section pertains as much to NetBSD and FreeBSD as
	it does to 386BSD.  Simply 'sed 's/386bsd/Your System/g' below.

	There are two types of documentation for 386bsd.  First is the 
	set that covers the operation and theory used in BSD-Unix.  
	These sources are often excellent for background and understanding 
	of the current implementation of 386bsd.  Second is the set of 
	manuals written specifically for 386bsd.  Most of these are books 
	and magazine articles written by Bill and Lynne Jolitz.


1.7.1	BSD manuals

	The full set of BSD documentation is available via anonymous FTP 
	from ocf.berkeley.edu in /pub/Library/Computer/doc4.3.  To print 
	this documentation on 386bsd systems, replace the ditroff 
	references in the Makefile with 'groff -e -t -msU {SRC} >out.ps' 
	to generate PostScript format files.  Use different options to 
	make the output conform to other print styles.

	The etc distribution also comes with a documentation directory
	/usr/share/doc which has nearly 3Meg of documentation about *BSD.
	  
	In addition, on-line manuals are available in the binary 
	distribution set.  It contains specific information on the use 
	of UNIX utilities and commands.  Type "man man" for information 
	on the online manual.


1.7.2	BSD books

	There is an excellent set of works recommended by Bill and Lynne 
	in the original 386bsd INSTALL.NOTES.  In addition, several other 
	books have been recommended by Andrew Moore and others.

	For learning how to work in the Unix environment, the standard text
	is "The Unix Programming Environment,"  by Kernighan and Pike.
	
	For Unix Administration, the best is "Unix System Administration
	Handbook," by Nemeth, Snyder and Seebass.

	For systems level programming (i.e., systems calls), I recommend
	"Advanced Unix Programming," by Marc Rochkind.  Unfortunately it is
	out-dated and oriented towards System V.  

	A new book "Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment," by W.
	Richard Stevens is very	up-to-date, and an excellent reference,
	especially for dealing with POSIX standards issues.

	For network programming, "Unix Network Programming," by W. Richard
	Stevens is highly regarded.
	
	The 4.3BSD Unix Manuals contain loads of invaluable tutorials and
	historical papers in addition to hard copies of on-line documentation.
	The six volume set is available from Usenix for $60.00 (email:
	office@usenix.org)

	The 4.4 BSD Unic Manuals are the authoritative source for
	information about the 4.4 BSD release, and by inference the
	NetBSD and FreeBSD systems.  They are available from O'Reilly
	and Associates (the Nutshell series people).  In addition the
	the six volume set, there is a CD included (at a price) of the
	entire 4.4 release.  Combine this with the NetBSD 1.0 or FreeBSD
	2.0 systems, and you should have a commercial quality operating
	system available in no time.

	I could go on, but let me mention just two more - if you have a full
	386BSD installation, you may want to learn the bash shell (in
	/usr/othersrc/public).  This is an extension of the Bourne shell (sh)
	with features from both the C shell (Csh) and the Korn shell (Ksh).
	The Korn shell is described in "The Kornshell," by Korn (of course).
	
	Second, I recommend you look at "The AWK Programming Language," by 
	Aho, Weinberger and Kernighan.  This is a very nice prototyping 
	language - powerful and easy to use.

	Another excellent reference book for 386bsd is "The Design and 
	Implementation of the 4.3BSD UNIX Operating system" by  Samuel J. 
	Leffler, Marshall Kirk McKusick, Michael J. Karels, John S. 
	Quarterman, 1989, Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-06196-1.  While this 
	book is out of date in many sections, it is purported to be an 
	excellent source of historical information, if nothing else.  
	Chris Demetriou recommends the sections on the treatment of 
	file systems, caching and the networking layer.  The sections in 
	this books which do not apply to 386bsd include the VM section, 
	bootstrapping, and autoconfig.

	Here is a list from Hellmuth Michaelis (duplicative as it may seem
	to have all of these lists) for more information on *BSD:

	this is not intended to be an exhaustive list by any means. 


1.7.3	The Jolitz Book

	Bill and Lynne Jolitz are writing a book about 386bsd.  It will 
	be announced once it is ready.  A tentative date of late 1992 
	was once offered, but since it is now 1994 and no book has 
	been announced, we can assume that it will be later than the 
	original estimate.

	Some of the parts are without code listings due to the unclear
	status of the BSD releases stemming from the Net/2 release.  Dr. 
	Dobbs is reported out of back issues of the articles listed above.
	You best bet may be to try your local public or school library.
	
1.7.5	Documentation that comes with most of the distributions.

	In the standard set for both NetBSD and FreeBSD there is a directory
	called '/usr/share/doc'.  Here is a 'du' listing.

		128	/usr/share/doc/ps1/06.sysman
		98	/usr/share/doc/ps1/07.ipctut
		116	/usr/share/doc/ps1/08.ipc
		16	/usr/share/doc/ps1/13.rcs
		37	/usr/share/doc/ps1/14.sccs

		21	/usr/share/doc/smm/20.termdesc
		17	/usr/share/doc/smm/22.timed
		851	/usr/share/doc/smm
		144	/usr/share/doc/usd/04.csh
		97	/usr/share/doc/usd/07.Mail
		66	/usr/share/doc/usd/09.newsread
		68	/usr/share/doc/usd/10.etiq
		67	/usr/share/doc/usd/14.edit
		107	/usr/share/doc/usd/15.vi
		61	/usr/share/doc/usd/16.ex
		13	/usr/share/doc/usd/21.msdiffs
		45	/usr/share/doc/usd/22.memacros
		43	/usr/share/doc/usd/23.meref
		26	/usr/share/doc/usd/33.rogue
		25	/usr/share/doc/usd/34.trek
		798	/usr/share/doc/usd
		2077	/usr/share/doc

	For those of you that don't read 'du -k' listings, this means that
	there is 'around' 2 MEGABYTES of documentation in the 'doc'
	directory.  In addition, there are a few man pages.

		2312	/usr/share/man/cat1
		397	/usr/share/man/cat2
		1	/usr/share/man/cat2a
		855	/usr/share/man/cat3
		1	/usr/share/man/cat3f
		607	/usr/share/man/cat4
		368	/usr/share/man/cat5
		166	/usr/share/man/cat6
		169	/usr/share/man/cat7
		749	/usr/share/man/cat8

	Something on the order of another 4 Megabytes of manual pages.  
	That's what, about 6 MILLION CHARACTERS of documentation.

	I have received mail from several sources saying that my
	approximation of the amount of system documentation is way too
	low (by a factor of at least 50%).  Given the fact that even by
	my meager estimation there is already more information here
	than most people can be bothered to read, whether there is 6
	Meg or 60 Meg seems like overkill.

	Now, does anyone REALLY want to whine about there being no 
	documentation included with the system?


1.7.6	Other FAQ's on the net that are relevant
	
	There is now a FAQ set up specifically for FreeBSD.  In addition
	to answering the many specific questions that folks have about
	FreeBSD, it is also a good source for information on NetBSD and
	whatever the 386BSD {0.2,1.0,95} project is going to look like.  
	In spite of all of the shouting and chest beating that you hear
	from time to time, the systems are still very close.

	There are many FAQs that can be used in conjunction with 386bsd.  
	These include the FAQs for all of the GNU software, the different 
	shells that are available, the programming languages that are 
	available, and many more.  In addition, many programs have their 
	own FAQ which should be referenced whenever that package is being 
	added.  Good examples of the latter are the FAQs for elm, C-News, 
	and innd.
	 
	The observant reader will notice that there are very few 'X' 
	questions in this FAQ.  The XFree86 FAQ is posted regularly to 
	comp.os.386bsd.*.  There is no good reason to include any 'X' 
	questions in this FAQ, with the exception of the most basic 
	'Where can I get the 'X' FAQ'.
	
	Most FAQs are available by anonymous FTP from rtfm.mit.edu and 
	via Usenet News in news.answers and/or comp.answers.  This FAQ
	is no exception (I hope). 
	
	
1.8	FTP sites for 386BSD
	
	A standard tool on Internet connected hosts for finding files is
	'archie'.  Searching the archie archive for either "386BSD"  or 
	"386bsd" yields the following list.   For UUCP sites, FTP-Mail 
	is available from gatekeeper.dec.com.  The list below was created 
	with an 'archie -l' on 26 Nov 1994 searching for 386bsd.

	For those folks that have access to telnet, but not FTP, you can use
	archie by using telnet and connecting to 132.206.2.3.  Log in as
	'archie' and use the 'prog' command to find programs of interest.
	The list below is included primarily for those folks that have only
	uucp, and will need to get their software though UUCP and other
	channels.
	

1.8.1	FTP Site List

	This list is automatically generated every time the FAQ is 
	produced.  Please do not request that your host be added to 
	this list.  If your host is represented in an 'archie' list,
	it will be reflected here.  Several other sites are included 
	in Section 1.8.4 below.

	Host					Directory


	The code may soon also to be available, or perhaps is already 
	available, from both CompuServe and BIX.

1.8.2	Official distribution sites

	According to Lynne Jolitz, there is no such thing as an 'official' 
	386bsd site.  The closest we had was 'agate.berkeley.edu' which is 
	now closed.  Because of the USL/UCB agreement, 386bsd is no
	longer freely redistributable, since it was based on Net/2 and
	Net/2 was encumbered.

	FreeBSD's 'home' is FreeBSD.cdrom.com (the home disk of Walnut
	Creek).  The portions of FreeBSD (versions less than 2.0) that
	were encumbered are distributed with the tolerance of
	AT&T/USL/Novell/whoever owns the source for SysV this week.  All
	FreeBSD versions (with version number >= 2.0) are based solely
	on the freely redistributable BSD 4.4 sources.

	NetBSD's 'home' is now ftp.NetBSD.Org.  All versions of
	NetBSD since 0.9 have replaced the kernel code from the 4.3 
	distribution with the source from the 4.4 distribution.  The
	only code still in NetBSD from the 4.3 distribution is some user
	program code that was uncontested in the USL/UCB agreement.


1.8.3	Reference sites

	For a brief period, ref.tfs.com was available for use as a
	reference system.  This system was used as the test-bed for
	many programs that were ported to 386bsd by many authors.  
	Unfortunately, ref.tfs.com has been disabled as a reference
	system. The site is now a update by mail (CTM) system and is 
	providing a mail only service for developers who do not have 
	access to anything more than electronic mail.  For more
	information, contact phk@freefall.cdrom.com for the standard
	CTM package.

	There is a site in Germany that is acting as a reference site 
	for FreeBSD.  The name is "g386bsd.first.gmd.de", also known as
	"bsd386.first.gmd.de". Sorry, no anonymous ftp yet. But there is
	a "guest" login with the password "guest".

	But the most important reason why I had installed the machine on 
	the network was for all these people who don't have enough space 
	to compile their own kernel or their own packages.   They can do 
	it on this machine.  ATS ( ats@first.gmd.de or ats@cs.tu-berlin.de )


1.8.4	Unofficial archive sites that have neat stuff!

	There are many sites that have things which have either been ported 
	to 386bsd or are available to the world.  Use archie to find these 
	sites, or read comp.os.386bsd.* for more information.
	
	Listed here because they don't have access to 'archie' yet...
	g386bsd.first.gmd.de -or- bsd386.first.gmd.de:
	    Sources for 386bsd0.1 and the later patchkits.
	    Source for NetBSD0.8 and the newer snapshots.

	    Xfree is installed binary as version 1.3.

	Ported software are:
	    tcsh6.03.00
	    emacs19-15
	    gcc-2.4.5
	    top3-1
	    perl4.0.36
	    elvis1.7
	    bison-1.21
	    rn and nn.

	 In addition, ftp.cs.tu-berlin.de has a lot of neat 
	 software and Wolfram Schneider (wosch@cs.tu-berlin.de) has 
	 'ported' the FAQ into LaTeX.  It is available in 
	 pub/386BSD/FAQ/tex in both PostScript and DVI formats.


1.8.5	 X for 386BSD 0.1 Ported Software List

	This is a list of non-core X window system application that 
	have been ported to 386BSD 0.1.  The ftp server and directory 
	name are listed above and each file or directory name is

1.8.6	Motif for the *BSD family. (Infomercial to follow)

	While I don't normally include commercials in the FAQ, I will
	this time.  Motif is an interesting product that will help the
	development of the free Unices.  It can also serve as a
	benchmark for other commercial organizations to consider
	supporting us by producing versions of their products that will work
	on these systems.

	Sequoia International, Inc. (305-783-4915/305-783-4935 (FAX))
	sells a complete Motif 1.2.3 Runtime and Development package
