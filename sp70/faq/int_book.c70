Thanks for the info: Robert Slade <ROBERTS@decus.ca>
Notes: (This review covers the first edition.) An instructional package for 
librarians teaching Internet basics. This book is useful for newcomers to 
the Internet. This book is useful for trainers. This book is useful for 
librarians. Ultimately, this book is most useful for those training 
librarians who are new to the Internet. A newcomer to the Internet might 
find this material a bit disorganized, but very definitely helpful and 
useful. It is heartening to see the very strong emphasis on Internet 
etiquette and culture which all too often gets short shrift, even in 
introductory guides. The grouping of discussion lists and electronic 
journals with e-mail is a logical extension which is not always made. The 
work is not limited to the novice, though; many Internet users would find 
the fact sheets to be a handy quick reference.

way some companies are doing business. Must reading for anyone looking at

critical for businesses. Matisse Enzer says: Excellent overview and 
detailed discussion of the Internet from a business users' perspective. An 
entirely non-technical book, Doing Business discusses the commercial

Title: DOS User's Guide to the Internet
Author: James Gardner
Publisher: Prentice Hall
ISBN: 0-13-106873-3
Price: $34.95
Pages: 308
Goodies: DOS disk
Published: 1993
For more information: (515) 284-6751 or phyllis@prenhall.com
Thanks for the info: Robert Slade <ROBERTS@decus.ca>
Notes: A minimalist software package and manual for setting up a UUCP 
connection for mail and news. This title is almost completely misleading. 
This book is not for DOS users, except that you must be running DOS to run 
the MKS UUCP for DOS programs for which this book is a manual. This book is 
also not about the Internet, as such. Both the specifics and the concepts 
refer to UUCP rather than the Internet. The text of the book does point out 
that there are differences, but the examples given relate to UUCP. That 
said, for those who are interested in making their first move to a direct 
Internet connection, this could be an excellent choice. UUCP was designed 
to be quite comfortable with dialup connections, and this book and 
associated programs, help to automate a number of the connection functions 
while freeing the user from much of the technical detail that TCP/IP 
requires.

Title: Driving the Infohighway - A Guide for VAX/VMS Users
Author: Gerald Neufeld
Publisher: New Fields Publishing
ISBN: ?
Price: $18.95 (US), $24.95 (CAN)
Pages: 296
Published: 1994
For more information: (204) 729-8943
Thanks for the info: Peter Scott <scottp@herald.usask.ca>
Notes: The book is for users who will be accessing the Internet via a 
VAX/VMS host. It is designed for a reader who has some familiarity with 
personal computers but who has had little or no experience in using the 
VAX. It assumes that the user will be accessing the VAX using a VT-100 or 
better terminal or terminal emulation program. It explains how to access 
the VAX using a PC on the campus-wide ethernet LAN or by modem. The book 
can be used as a tutorial for beginners. The novice user will find the step 
by step instructions, practical examples, and glossary very helpful. 
However, the book can also be used as a valuable resource for the more 
experienced user.

Notes: Mike was the Multics system-programmer at Project Mac, and is 
personally responsible for putting two systems on the ARPAnet back when 
that meant hacking the OS designed and implemented a number of protocols 
including being working-group chair, and has been a commentator on Internet 
RFCs since the beginning. (He was also Dennis Ritchie's officemate before 
Bell Labs pulled out of Multics & Dennis had to invent UNIX, and has a 
personal exemption from Dijkskstra to use a GOTO when, in his professional 
opinion as a protocol implementor, it is necessary.) This is a book on 
style in protocol design and the great Bromdinagian TCP vs. ISO debates. 
It's a nice piece of history and explains where TCP, TELNET, FTP came from.

Notes: Slade writes: I find it very difficult to define who, or what, this 
book is for, but I would recommend it primarily to managers in charge of 
large networks and possibly internetworks needing to evaluate email systems 
with extended functionality. The title would suggest this is a discussion 
of the basics of email. That is true only in the most simplistic and 
superficial way.

50 United States (plus the capitol) are using the Internet as the first 
stepping stone toward the Clinton administration's "information 
superhighway". Written as an oral narrative from the mouths of the people 
making these projects work, the book covers uses of the Internet in

of the individuals/projects mentioned. You can get the text of the book

many of these are treated very briefly but as an overall introductory

Notes: This book is for the thousands of people who have "only E-mail" 
access to the Internet and think all they're going to get is mail. I get 
the impression this book is intended for people who have just been "given" 
an account and perhaps a cursory description of how to send and read 
messages. But we all can learn from it. It's amazing what you can do with 
Internet mail if you know how to do it. Clay Shirky shows you how in this 
very easy-to-absorb, non-overpowering title.

Title: The Internet Companion, A Beginner's Guide To Global Networking

Thanks for the info: Robert Slade <ROBERTS@decus.ca>
Notes: The Companion includes a detailed history of the Internet, a 
discussion on "netiquette" (network etiquette), and how to find resources 
on the net. It is difficult to know what is supposed to be "companionable" 
about this volume. Physically, it would be easy to carry it along with you. 
You probably wouldn't want to, though. This is not a guide for 
explorations, either. It does give one some background on the Internet, but 
it is not in a step-by-step fashion. (How to access the Internet is the 
*last* topic to be covered.) The newcomer to the Internet will more likely 
want to read it all (possibly at one sitting; it's small enough) and look 
at the network gestalt. This work is somewhat less technical than the UNIX 
biased "Whole Internet Guide". However, it goes too far in the opposite 
direction. The authors boast that it was finished in less than two months. 
It shows. Companies which are getting into the Internet in a big way might 
make this the introductory volume for new users: it is generally upbeat and 
non-threatening. However, help should be on hand when people actually start 
using the net.

Notes: A grassroots guide to learning about the Internet. It takes the 
clueless newbie and leads him from the fundamentals - like understanding 
what the Internet is, how to connect and how addressing works - and through 
the Internet's most important tools. This book doesn't cover any ground 
that hadn't been trod dozens of times before by other everything-you-need-
to-know-about-the-Internet book ever written, but it delivers the 
information in a lively, always interesting manner. No topics are glossed 
over and the authors never get mired in the dirty technical details. This 
book is intended for folks who will be accessing the Internet using a UNIX 
command line prompt. If you are just trying to get started on the Internet, 
but don't know which of 50 step-by-step hold-your-hand books in your 
bookstore you should buy, The Internet Complete Reference won't disappoint 
you.

Notes: A very complete introduction to the world of the Internet. Along 
with the obligatory topics such as telnet, FTP and Archie, the book 
suggests how to get an Internet account and teaches enough UNIX to survive 
on the net. This book is more complete and in-depth than many other 
Internet books: Dern's deep knowledge of all things Internet shines 
through, although sometimes the book is a bit too formal. The book, like 
Dern, is laced with dry humor and is UNIX-centric. Highly recommended.

technical terms that tech-heads bandy about relentlessly (like CSO name 
server, ISDN, and OSI protocol suite) and can give beginners and 
intermediate users a leg up in understanding what everyone's talking about.

Notes: This book is part quick reference, part lexicon and part Internet 
tutorial. Arranged in dictionary format, it defines Internet jargon (like 
shareware and hypertext) gives brief descriptions of tools (like Knowbot 
and Listserv), includes short command summaries for using popular programs 
(like FTP, emacs and elm), and describes various 'net organizations, 
policies and legislature. Nice design and layout. This book contains a wide 
variety of information, but is sort of unevenly edited and contains some 
factual errors that might not be clear to newbies (for instance, in one 
section it confuses the terms upload and download.)

Thanks for the info: Robert Slade <ROBERTS@decus.ca>
Notes: Covers everything from net etiquette to supercomputers; very 
comprehensive. This work is a fairly bare bones and no nonsense guide to 
the Internet. The book is orderly, and the explanations and illustrations 
are clear. Each chapter covers a single topic and ends with additional 
references, most often online materials or sources. The work is well 
researched and highly competent in most cases. There is, in the early 
chapters, a gracelessness to it which lacks any kind of appeal. 
Nevertheless, it is a thoroughly researched and valuable reference for 
those interested in using the resources of the Internet. It costs $39.95 
but schools and not-for-profit organizations can buy it for $19.95 plus 
shipping.

Notes: Graham Rodgers says: "64-page guide to Internet basics. Very easy to 
follow instructions, clearly set out. With the small size not everything 
can be included but the price represents good value. The paper cover 
deteriorates with use." I say: A whole lot of information for the money. 
Well-presented, simple and above all, short. Covers "What is the 
Internet?", terms, UNIX basics, e-mail, Usenet, FTP, rlogin and telnet, 
finger, archie, gopher and veronica. Easy-to-follow examples. They'll sell 
you just one, but the book is primarily intended to be sold to service 
providers and distributed to their users.

concerned that the reader get a good grasp of the Internet system quickly. 
In my case he succeeded; and what he can do for me, he can do for you!" I 
say: This book is a winner. It explains the basics of the Internet in a 
clear and concise style. Covers the tools for reading Usenet news, doing e-
mail, using FTP, gopher and WorldWideWeb. Doesn't get into the newer, 
funkier tools too much. It's an easy read and doesn't get bogged down in 
esoteric, dull stuff. I even like the cover.

Title: Internet Starter Kit for Macintosh

Goodies: Mac floppy disk filled with great software and free connect time
Published: 2nd ed., 1994
For more information: tisk@tidbits.com
Notes: I used to think that this was absolutely the best Internet book for 
Macintosh users that was ever - or could ever be - written. Then, the 
second edition came out and proved me wrong. This book claims to be 
"everything you need to get on the Internet" and it delivers: everything 
from the software you'll need to get connected, to 1,000 pages of copious 
knowledge. This is a fun, enlightening, excellent book. If you own a Mac 
and are on the Internet (or want to connect) this is the one to get.

Title: Internet Starter Kit for Windows

Eudora and WSgopher and free connect time 
Published: 1994
For more information: iskw@tidbits.com
Notes: This book is an excellent resource dedicated to Microsoft Windows 
users. It isn't quite as strong as The Internet Starter Kit for Macintosh 
but is nonetheless a wonderful guide for teaching Windows users about the 
Internet and getting them online. It contains all the software you need to 
get online and explains how to use it. The book's resource listings, list 
of newsgroups, glossary and PDIAL and nixpub lists are perhaps too thorough 
- they take up about half the book.

Pages: ?
Published: 1993

Thanks for the info: Robert Slade <ROBERTS@decus.ca>
Notes: Essays by people involved with the Internet. Strong on protocols, 
weak on direction. The book is divided into four parts. The first section 
deals with an historical and organizational background to the Internet. The 
second section, written by the people who built the Internet, deals with 
technical aspects of the major protocols and applications of the Internet. 
Part three, "Infrastructure," covers issues not centrally relevant to the 
operation of the Internet, but supporting its use: network performance and 
management, backbone and node tools, directory services and operational 
security. The bibliographic information contained in the book overall might 
be worth the price alone. Quarterman's contribution is carefully and fully 
researched and well organized. It includes not only texts, but periodicals 
and online sources as well.

of home computers, networks and with high-speed connections. This book 
covers just about every Internet topic you can think of, from security to 
MUDs, from doing business on the 'net to copyright issues and problems.

Notes: A thick book listing about 100,000 e-mail addresses. (Although that 
may seem like a lot, it's not very comprehensive.) Addresses are listed by 
last name and are also indexed by Internet domain name. This book may be 
useful for finding associates' e-mail addresses, but is probably no more 
useful than using one of the many 'net-based e-mail-address search 
utilities. The book is unevenly edited (I'm in there three times!) and was 
woefully out of date before the ink was dry.

Pages: 447
Published: 1994
Notes: The Internet Yellow Pages strives to be an unmatched subject-
oriented index to the Internet's resources, a lofty goal given the number 
of competing indexes available. Hahn and Stout do it right - this book is a 
resource that long-time Internet addicts and new users will enjoy equally 
well. Organization is intuitive and consistent. Although it does not point 
you to as many online resources as some other directories, the ones it 
points to tend to be high-quality and truly interesting sites to visit. 
Well-researched and well-indexed.

Notes: As the "TV Guide of Cyberspace," this book provides pointers by

Notes: This slim book does an excellent job of helping those new to 
Cyberspace learn the basic tenants of network etiquette, or "netiquette". 
It's easy to read and loaded with interesting real-life examples. Chapters 
cover netiquette of e-mail and of discussion groups as well as providing 
excellent netiquette guidelines for business, home and school use. 
Particularly useful sections cover Electronic Style (looking good online, 
tone of voice and signature files) and the "core rules" of the online 
world. One chapter covers copyright issues and another the etiquette of e-
mail privacy. There's even a tiny chapter on "Love & Sex in Cyberspace". 
This book should be required reading for anyone collecting their Internet 
Learner's Permit. (You can retrieve a brief excerpt from Netiquette: "The 
Core Rules of Netiquette" by sending e-mail to netiquette-
request@albion.com with the words "archive send core" in the subject line.)

Notes: Of the various Internet White and Yellow pages books out there, this 
one looks and acts the most like a "real" telephone book: personal listings 
of your name and e-mail address are free, advertising space in the yellow 
pages section is available for a fee, and the book itself it distributed 
for free. With only a few thousand names in the first edition, this listing 
is hardly the most complete, but it only contains information about people 
who choose to be listed.

other lairs of the hacker.) Very silly and highly recommended. You can get 
it for free online (The Jargon File) at //www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon.html,

This huge book covers vast ground in its 900-plus pages. Although the 
quantity is there, the quality isn't exceptional: it is rather unevenly 
edited. Some of the listings seem to be listed by name rather than subject 
and many items are listed in multiple places, artifically inflating the 
size of the book. This index is unique in that it contains listings of some 
commercial services available via the Internet, such as DIALOG. Icons 
differentiate the free resources from the costly ones.

For more information: dilennox@aol.com
Notes: This book (with floppy disk) for MS-DOS users helps newcomers get 
online and take their first steps on the 'net. Fraase first wrote the Mac 
Internet Tour Guide, and this book seems more like an afterthought than a 
follow-up. Chapters cover obligatory topics like What is the Internet, 
Getting Connected, Network News, Transferring Files, Using Gopher and Other 
Internet Resources. The book's organization leaves something to be desired: 
talk of telnet, FAQs and Netfind (hardly unimportant topics) are lumped 
together in the "Other Resources" chapter near the back of the book. The 
book includes some interesting real-life examples and ideas for things to 
do online, but too much (for my taste) focuses on how to set up and use the 
bundled software.

Thanks for the info: Robert Slade <ROBERTS@decus.ca>
Notes: Fisher shows admirable restraint in limiting the scope of this book. 
Where others try to produce "complete" documentation for the "whole" 
Internet, Fisher flatly states (correctly) that this is impossible. Where 
others try to take you "from the modem up," Fisher suggests you get some 
basic experience with local bulletin boards. The intent is to give desktop 
(PC and Mac) users some basic grounding in Internet functions and tools. As 
such, the book is much less imposing than most of the others of this ilk. 
(Cheaper, too.) For the majority of new users, however, this is a good, 
basic introduction. What shortcomings there are in specific information can 
be quickly filled in once a user has gotten onto the net. The very personal 
style here probably more than makes up for any other lacks--the Internet is 
primarily other people, not technologies.

Notes: While not strictly an Internet book, this tome focuses on one thing: 
the UNIX program sendmail, which is a huge part of how electronic mail 
moves around on the Internet. Mainly for system administrators, the book 
shows how to use every function, mode and mood of sendmail to get your e-
mail where it's going. A great, if single-minded, book.

job, the authors show you not only how to find job listings online, but how 
to use the 'net to reserach prospective employers and find international 
job sources. It also covers lots of ground in education, art, entertainment 
and business. Even if you've been on the 'net for years, this book can show 
you corners of the 'net you've never imagined.

seems to favor the online services featuring ZiffNet online. I wonder 
why...

that are also available online for free. Doesn't cover rot13 or how to

Thanks for the info: matisse@well.sf.ca.us (J Matisse Enzer)
Notes: This guide should give you a reference to consult if you're curious 
about what can be done with the Internet. It also presents the fundamental 
topics that are all too often assumed and considered trivial by many 
network users. It covers the basic utilities and information reaching other 
networks. An earlier, much less comprehensive version is available via FTP; 
see previous section. Matisse Enzer says: Very friendly general overview 
book. Not really a how-to book, rather a Cultural Companion that explain 
what each type of Internet resource is, as well as the cultural and 
traditional uses and issues. Includes a chapter on "Things you will hear 
about..." this chapter explains many famous (and infamous) Internet events

Title: !%@:: A Directory of Electronic Mail Addressing and Networks
Author: Donnalyn Frey & Rick Adams
Publisher: O'Reilly & Associates
ISBN: 1-56592-046-5
Price: $9.95
Pages: 640
Published: 4th ed, June 1994
For more information: 800-998-9938 or info@ora.com
Thanks for the info: Robert Slade <ROBERTS@decus.ca>
Notes: This book is a reference work. It details the various computer 
networks with gateways to the Internet. It is common to cite such works as 
"indispensable": in fact, most users, and even site managers, muddle along 
quite happily without it. Quick reference "electronic" versions exist of 
very similar documents, which provide the addressing schemes for the more 
common network and commercial service gateways. Frey and Adams have, 
however, put together a very complete and interesting reference, and I do 
suggest it to anyone managing, or using, extensive e-mail correspondence. 
As a user of electronic mail, or the manager of a small Internet node or 
UUCP site, it would be hard to say that you "need" this book. If, however, 
you are at all interested in the topic of e-mail, you will find this 
fascinating and useful.
