NOTICE:


   The files AWK1.REV and AWK2.REV are _not_ in the public domain. I am
retaining the rights to prepare future derivative works as well as limit
their distribution. 


   Under no circumstances may you make any changes to these files nor use
portions of them in your own work without my written permission.


   You may distribute copies of these reviews provided you abide by the
following three conditions:

     i)   You must keep together AWK1.REV, AWK2.REV, and this file 
          in their unaltered forms.

     ii)  There must be no attempt to make a profit with these
          these files. Specifically prohibited from distributing
          these reviews are electronic bulletin boards that impose
          access charges/membership fees and newsletters that
          require a subscription fee. Shipping and handling charges
          may be collected as long as another, _free_ means of
          distribution is available and made known in advance.

     iii) You must not add to, or subtract from, the conditions
          for distribution which I have imposed here.

If you do not meet these conditions but would still like to distribute the
reviews, send me a description of your bbs, newsletter, or whatever so
that I can evaluate its merits. Note, however, that I have a strong
dislike for CompuServe, Genie and other for-profit services.


   If these conditions seem overly stringent to you, tough! I have spent a
considerable amount of time with these reviews, and I do not want anyone
to change my words, use them without proper credit, or make a profit from
my work. Should you have any doubts about the conditions I have imposed,
contact me _before_ you begin to distribute these reviews.
