Version 3.6.0 - June 12, 1991 ( M. Rausche & P. Knoerrich )

    Fixed a problem with LZHs created with  LHARC ver 2.0 and  above that
    resulted in hanging the machine.
    Fixed some problems with printing pathnames in archives.
    All Microsoft and Profiler stuff deleted.

Version 3.5.0 - June 6, 1991 ( M. Rausche & P. Knoerrich )

    Added ARJ handling. (Internal release only)

Version 3.4.5 - July 9, 1990

    Fixed a problem in the handling of "Authenticated" ZIPs that resulted 
    in an "Invalid Central Directory" message from FFF.  

Version 3.4.4 - June 29, 1990

    Fixed a problem that caused FFF to hang  if  it  encountered  an  FFF 
    Environment Variable containing only disk specifiers, i.e: 

        SET FFF=ABCD

    Thanks to Rick Hallowell for reporting this bug.

Version 3.4.3 - June 20, 1990

    Fixed a problem in the pattern matched  with  patterns  of  the  form 
    "???abc" or "abc???".  
    Added a "key test" routine to allow the user to abort FFF at any time 
    during the search by pressing the "ESC" key.  
    FFF can now display the date,  in the "verbose" mode, in any of three 
    forms  at  the  user's  option:   "International",   i.e.   yy-mm-dd, 
    "Military", i.e. dd Mmm yy, or "U.S.", i.e mm/dd/yy.  

Version 3.4.2 - June 16, 1990

    Corrected  an error in the new pattern matcher that affected patterns 
    of the form '*abcd*'.
    Compiled with Turbo C++ 1.0.  

Version 3.4.1 - June 15, 1990

    This version existed only to correct some bad uploads.  The wrong ZIP 
    file was uploaded to CompuServ and several other systems.  There  was 
    no change in the internals.  

Version 3.4.0 - June 12, 1990

    Installed a new pattern matcher to fix  a  number  of  holes  in  the 
    enhanced pattern matching.  
    Added  a new option,  '-c',  to allow output in lower case instead of 
    the default upper case - much easier on the eyes!  

Version 3.3.3 - May 30, 1990

    Fixed a format problem in showing the date and time for a file within 
    an ARC (or PAK) file correctly.  

Version 3.3.2 - March 23, 1990

    Fixed still another problem in the MATCH routine that  prevented  FFF 
    from finding files matching the "*.xxx" pattern.  

Version 3.3.1 - February 25, 1990

    Fixed yet another problem in the MATCH  routine  that  prevented  FFF 
    from finding files matching the "*.xxx" pattern".  

Version 3.3.0 - January 26, 1990

    Fixed a major error introduced in version 3.2.0  that  prevented  FFF 
    from  finding  files  inside of archives!  Add the ability to "stack" 
    options  (i.e  "-acv"  as  well  as  "-a  -v  -f".  Made  the  source 
    compatible  with Microsoft C 5.1 as well as Turbo C 2.0 and introduce 
    a MAKEFILE for Microsoft C.  Minor speed-ups in the pattern  matching 
    routine and in the directory searching routines.  

Version 3.2.2 - January 24, 1990

    Repaired the match() routine.  The old routine  said  that  ONLINE.C1
    matched  the  pattern  *1.*.  Since  ONLINE does not end with 1,  the
    match was erroneous.  Thanks to Terry  Shankland  for  reporting  the
    error.

Version 3.2.1 - January 20, 1990

    Repaired  the  processing  of  the  FFF  Environment  Variable.  Disk
    specifiers  terminating  with a ":" caused the system to "hang".  The
    two new options,  created in version 3.2.0,  caused FFF to  become  a
    "NOP" if they were specified in the Environment Variable.

Version 3.2.0 - January 12, 1990

    At the request of user's,  a '-q' option has been added  to  suppress
    the statistics output.

    A  '-f'  option has been added that changes the format of the date in
    the verbose output from the "military" form - numeric day followed by
    three character alphabetic month followed by  numeric  year  -  to  a
    format that can be more readily sorted - YY/MM/DD.

    With  this  version,  multiple patterns can be specified and FFF will
    search for all of them in a single pass.

Version 3.1.1 - December 17, 1989

    At the suggestion of several users,  FFF now has a hard-coded default
    disk to search,  the "current disk".  This hard-coded default will be
    overridden by any disks specified in the FFF Environment Variable and
    any disks specified on  the  command  line  will  override  both  the
    hard-coded  default  and  any  disks specified in the FFF Environment
    Variable.

Version 3.1.0 - December 7, 1989

    At the suggestion of a user,  FFF will now  process  and  Environment
    Variable,  "FFF",  to establish its defaults.  Unfortunately,  on the
    day that I was reading the suggestion, I was on a VERY noisy line and
    a noise burst caused CompuServ to delete the message and disconnected
    by line before I  could  make  a  note  of  who  it  was  making  the
    suggestion!

    Irv  Hoff  convinced me that the LZH and PAK archives are more common
    that I had thought so the processing of those archive types was added
    to this version of FFF before  I  had  planned  on  doing  so.  Other
    archive  types  will,  at  some  time  in the future,  also be added,
    however,  I have to get a current version of the archive program that
    produces them first.  Since I, and none of my "clients", have any LZH
    or  PAK  archives  on my system,  the processing of them has NOT been
    heavily tested!  Approximately 200 LZH and PAK  archives,  that  were
    specially created for the purpose, have been processed correctly.

Version 3.0.1 - December 3, 1989

    This  version  was  purely a maintenance release!  The executable and
    documentation for  Version  2.1.1  was  inadvertently  inserted  into
    FFF300.ZIP instead of the correct versions.

Version 3.0.0 - November 22, 1989

    This   version   contained   a   major   improvement  in  performance
    (approximately 25%) in processing ZIP archives.

Version 2.1.1 - November 15, 1989

    The '-p' option to paginate the output every 23 lines  was  added  in
    this version at the suggestion of a user.

Version 2.1.0 - November 1, 1989

    The '-v' option to cause FFF to show the size,  date,  and time for a
    "found" file was added in this version at the suggestion of a user.

Version 2.0.0 - October 19, 1989

    First public release.
