FileFind is a program that is functionally similar to the familiar
WHERE.  It will search on or more disks, looking for files whose names 
match a specified pattern.  The major difference between FFF and other 
programs of its type is that  FFF  can,  optionally,  look  for  files
inside  of any of six  of the more popular archive file formats,  .ARC
(or &PKA), .ARJ, .LZH, .PAK, .ZIP, and .ZOO. Also, FFF is fully in the
public  domain  -  no  copyrighted  code  and  all  of the source (for 
Borland's Turbo C) is included.  By default,  FFF  searches  only  the 
current disk and will search inside of any of the common archive files 
that  it  finds.  The disk or disks to be searched can be specified on 
the command line and there is a command line option  to  suppress  the 
searching inside of archive files.

USAGE:

        C:>FFF [disk_specifier(s):]pattern [pattern ....] [options]     

The disk specifier(s) are  the  concatenation  of  the  drives  to  be 
searched  and  the  pattern  are  standard  MS-DOS file name patterns, 
optionally including "wild cards".  With version 3.2.0, FFF can search  
for multiple patterns in a single pass.  By default,  FFF will  search  
the "current disk" if no disks are specified on the Command line or in  
the  FFF  Environment Variable.  FFF offers one small enhancement over  
the MS-DOS pattern matching in that  it  will  allow  the  "match  any 
number  of any characters" character,  "*",  to appear anywhere in the 
pattern,  not just at the end.  If, at any time during the search, the
user presses the "ESC" key, FFF will immediately terminate.           


OPTIONS:                                                                 
                                                                         
FFF recognizes six options:                                            
                                                                         
        -a·Reverses  the  default  setting  for  searching  inside  of  
           archive files.  The FFF default is ON - to search inside of  
           archive files - but may be modified by the  user  with  the  
           "FFF" Environment Variable.                                  
                                                                         
        -v·Reverses  the  default  setting  for  the  verbose printing  
           option.  The FFF default is OFF  -  do  NOT  print  verbose  
           information  -  but  may  be  modified by the user with the  
           "FFF" Environment Variable.                                  

        -f·Changes the date format  for  the  verbose  form  form  the
           "Military"  form - DD Mon YY - to the "Internationl" form -
           YY-MM-DD - a form that is sortable.

        -u·Changes the date format  for  the  verbose  mode  from  the  
           "Military"  form  -  DD  Mon YY - the the more familar "US"
           form - MM/DD/YY.

        -p·Reverses the setting of  the  pagination  option.  The  FFF  
           default  is  OFF - do not paginate every 23 lines - but may  
           be  modified  by  the  user  with  the  "FFF"   Environment  
           Variable.  before  continuing.  If the response is anything  
           other  than  'N',  'n'  or  Ctl-C,  the  output  continues,  
           otherwise the program terminates.                            

        -q·Suppresses  the  printing of the statistics on total files,  
           files matched, and archive files.                            

        -c·Change the output from upper case to lower case.

The  case  of  the options is not significant and the option(s) may be 
specified either  before  or  after  the  pattern  specification.  The
options may be specified individually (i.e.  "-a -v -f") or  "stacked" 
(i.e. "-avf") and may be in either upper case or lower case.  The '-f'
and  '-u'  options  or  mutually exclusive and only the last specified
will be in effect, i.e.  if the option '-vfu' were specified, the date
would be shown in "US" format where if the option were to be specified
as '-vuf', the date would be shown in "International" format.


"FFF" ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE:                                             
                                                                        
With  version  3.1.0,  FFF  will read an optional Environment Variable 
"FFF" to establish its defaults.  The "FFF" Environment  Variable  can 
set  the default disks to be searched and the default setting for each 
of  the  command  line  options.   Any  disks  specified  in  the  FFF
Environment Variable will override the hard-coded default of searching
the  "current  disk".  Options  specified  on  the  command  line will
override those set by the "FFF" Environment Variable.  
                                                                        

TERMINATION:

Since a number of searches can require a large  amount  of  time,  FFF
provides  the  user  with  the  ability to terminate at any time.  If,
during  the  search,  the  user  presses  the  "ESC"  key,   FFF  will
immediately terminate.
           
EXAMPLES: 

On my current hard disk,  the following command will  find  all  files 
whose  name  begins  with  "AC"  on the current disk,  including those 
inside of ARJs, ARCs, LZHs, PAKs, ZIPs, and/or ZOOs, regardless of the
extension: 

        C:>FFF AC*

FFF will respond with the following listing:

        FFF: FastFileFind - Version 3.6.0: June 12, 1991

        C:\ACELST.LST
        C:\ACELST
        C:\ACELST.307
        C:\ACELST.ZIP
        C:\ACELST.ZIP--> (ACELST.301)
        C:\ACELST.ZIP--> (ACELST.302)
        C:\ACELST.ZIP--> (ACELST.303)
        C:\ACELST.ZIP--> (ACELST.306)
        C:\ACELST.ZIP--> (ACELST.307)
        C:\ANYWHERE\ACANCEL.EXE
        C:\ANYWHERE\ACHKSUM.EXE

The  files,  ACELST.301,  ACELST.302,  ACELST.303,   ACELST.306,   and 
ACELST.307,  shown  in  parentheses  following the file ACELST.ZIP are 
members of that ZIP archive file.  

To find all files on the current disk that begin with "AC" and have no  
extension,  including those inside of ARJs,  ARCs,  LZHs,  PAKs, ZIPs,
and/or ZOOs, would require the following command:

        C:>FFF AC*.

which would produce the following listing:

        FFF: FastFileFind - Version 3.6.0 : June 12, 1991

        C:\ACELST


To search disks A and C for all files that  contain  the  letter  pair 
"WH"  anywhere  if their name,  including those inside of ARJs,  ARCs,
LZHs, PAKs, ZIPs, and/or ZOOs, would require the following command:

        C:>FFF AC:*WH*

and would produce the following listing:

        FFF: FastFileFind - Version 3.6.0: June 12, 1991

If you wanted to search disk C:, D:, and E:  by default without having  
to specify the "cde:" on the command line each time, you could set the  
"FFF" Environment Variable:                                             
                                                                        
    SET FFF=CDE                                                         
                                                                        
in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.  The, if you issue the command:                   
                                                                        
    C:>FFF FFF*                                                         
                                                                        
FFF will search drives C:,  D:,  and E:  for all files beginning  with  
"FFF"  regardless  of  the extension,  including those inside of ARJs,
ARCs,  LZHs,  PAKs,  ZIPs  and/or  ZOOs.  If  you  had set  the  "FFF"
Environment Variable as shown above and wanted to search only on drive
C:, for example, you would have to enter the command:
                                                                        
    C:>FFF C:FFF*                                                       
                                                                        
The specification of  C:  on  the  command  line  would  override  the  
defaults established by the "FFF" Environment Variable.                 
                                                                        
The "FFF" Environment Variable can also be used to  set  the  defaults  
for the '-a',  '-v',  '-f-,  '-p',  and 'q' command line options.  For  
example:                                                                
                                                                        
    SET FFF=CDE -a                                                      
                                                                        
would set the default to NOT search inside of archive files.  Again, a  
command line option would override the "FFF" Environment Variable.  If  
you had set the  "FFF"  Environment  Variable  to  suppress  searching  
inside of archives,  you could have FFF search inside of archive files  
anyway with the command line:                                           
                                                                        
    C:>FFF FFF* -a
