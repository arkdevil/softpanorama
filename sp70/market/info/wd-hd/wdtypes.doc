                         Field Applications Engineering
    
                         Document for WDTYPES.EXE Utility

                         (C) 1993 Western Digital Corp.
    
            This document is intended to accompany the WDTYPES.EXE utility
            placed on this BBS for your convenience. First our disclaimer:
    
            Western Digital assumes no liability for the fitness, operation
            or results of this program. It was created solely for systems
            integrators' use in configuring an AT compatible computer.
    
            Now that that's out of the way, we shall go on ...
    
            This utility is intended to aid beginners or those stuck with
            undocumented equipment in the installation of Western Digital's


    
    


            hard disk controllers and / or drives in most AT compatible
            computers.
    
            When loaded, the utility will scan the entire 64K page of BIOS
            memory for a configuration that matches the original AT's
            drive type #1. This drive was defined as follows :
    
                    306 cylinders
                    4   heads
                    17  sectors per track
    
            This specific signature is searched throughout the BIOS area.
            If found, the utility calls this a drive type 1, and proceeds
            to display all other valid drive type tables. Many BIOS
            companies have nonsensical ones included in a string of valid
            configurations. The program is trained to ignore those types
            that have zero heads or cylinders, and to stop the search when
            a larger than 2047 cylinder or 16 head type is found.


    
    


    
            In the event a match for the 10 Megabyte drive test fails, the
            program will search for a 20 Megabyte drive of the following
            configuration :
    
                    615 cylinders
                    4   heads
                    17  sectors per track
    
            Several versions of BIOS were distributed with this configuration
            as the first drive type.
    
    







    
    


    
                            IN CASE OF DIFFICULTY ...
    
    
            To verify the findings of this utility, run your system's
            SETUP utility and define a hard drive type 1. Your hard drive
            can then be installed ( ... if it has at least 4 heads and 306
            cylinders ...) and it should function as a 10 Megabyte hard
            drive. The DOS utility FDISK should report 305 ( or 304 )
            cylinders.
    
                                 REMEMBER ...
    
            You can only use a drive type that meets the following :
    
                    1) LESS than or EQUAL TO the actual number of
                       CYLINDERS on the drive you are trying to
                       install.


    
    


    
                    2) EQUAL TO the actual number of HEADS on the
                       drive you are trying to install.
    
                    3) EQUAL to the SECTORS PER TRACK of BOTH THE
                       DRIVE AND CONTROLLER !!
    
                       ST-506 MFM DRIVES & CONTROLLERS HAVE 17 SECTORS
                       ST-506 RLL DRIVES & CONTROLLERS HAVE 26-31 SECTORS *
                       ESDI DRIVES AND CONTROLLERS HAVE 17-54 SECTORS  *
    
            * Western Digital manufactures controllers that have ON-BOARD
              BIOS ROMS to accept other than motherboard BIOS drive
              configurations. Contact your dealer.

            If you are unsure of your drive's parameters, a file called
            DRIVES.LST is available on this TBBS to assist you in most
            of the popular (and some unpopular) hard drives.
