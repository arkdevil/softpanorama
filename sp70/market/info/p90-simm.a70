Intel manual recommends 70ns. No speed improvement with 60ns, however 60ns
maybe better insurance in case you upgrade later. I have heard horror
stories with the gold plated leads, but only on the net. Maybe someone else
can give more information.

Usually faster is ok. The only reason for NOT using faster is the
SIMM ID code will be different and if the system checks the SIMM
ID code, it may not like the 60ns codes.

Either tin or gold leads are fine BUT you must use all gold or all
tin. Do NOT mix the two. You can cause electrolytic corrosion.
I have seen one system where the user had mixed gold and tin SIMMs
and one of the SIMMs had arc'ed around some leads burning out the
SIMM.

Sorry, I can't let this one go by --- mixing gold/tin plated SIMMs in
a system will *NOT* give you this kind of problem.  You should match the
plating of your SIMMs with the SOCKETS into which they will be inserted to
avoid corrosion problems, but even if you don't, the only consequence will
be data errors in a few years.  If you have leads burning off your SIMMs,
it is because you weren't careful enough and installed one with just enough
misalignment to short pins together.  (Trust me, having done just that, I
know the consequences).  Again, match the plating on the socket to the SIMMs
and you'll be OK, but if you don't, don't sweat it.

In this particular case the system was running fine for several
months with the mixed SIMMs before it crashed and burned with
a parity error. Whatever caused the SIMM leads to short out took
a while to happen. The mixture of tin and gold leads was a good
candidate as well as the fact the customer bought cheap SIMMs.
However I will have to disagree about matching the plating on
the sockets and the SIMMs. My company's official position is
tin is preferred but as long as they are all of the same type
it is okay. Mixing tin and gold is definitely a cause to bill
you for any service call that would otherwise be covered under
warranty.
