 I find this post noteworthy. The developer of Mesa is actually keeping
 tabs on individual user reactions and requests for changes and additions
 to their product. A few years ago I sent some bug reports and suggestions
 to Lotus and never heard back from them at all.

 Have to say it looks promising!
