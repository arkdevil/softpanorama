1.0.  OVERVIEW.

1.1.  DIET.EXE reduces the disk-storage space needed by ex-
ecutable and data files WITHOUT giving up immediate access to
such files.  DIET is a Freeware Program.

  (a)   When DIET compresses an EXECUTABLE file (.EXE or .COM),
        it adds a header that automatically expands the file when
        it is executed.

  (b)   On average, DIET reduces the size of .EXE & .COM files
        by 40%.

  (c)   Self-expansion of DIETed .EXE & .COM files is so fast
        that it is difficult to measure the change in the speed
        of file execution.  You certainly won't notice any
        change.

  (d)   DIET's self-expansion of .EXE and .COM files is similar
        to PKLITE or LZEXE, except that DIET also lets you com-
        press overlay files -- something that PKLITE and LZEXE
        cannot do.


1.2.  What makes DIET really unique is its ability to compress
DATA Files and to automatically expand them when you call them
into an Word Processor or Editor to read or change them.

  (a)   To use that feature, you must load DIET so that it is
        resident in memory (i.e., Terminate and Stay Resident, or
        TSR).

  (b)   DIET reduces the size of an average DATA File by 2/3rd.

  (c)   DIET's automatic expansion of Data Files adds a little
        time (on a 386SX-16 system, about 3 sec. compared to
        loading a 100k byte unDIETed text file into an editor).
        But that is a small price for the benefit of being able
        to keep infrequently-used Data Files on your Hard Disk,
        instead of having to store them on floppies. And you can
        optionally set up DIET so that it will automatically
        recompress Data Files when you exit your Editor.

  (d)   Many -- but not all -- application programs can use
        DIETed DATA files.  For example, QUATTRO can use DIETed
        ???.WQ1 files; dBASE cannot use DIETed ???.DBF files.
        You'll have to experiment.

















































This document is the USER'S GUIDE for DIET v.1.45F.  To learn
about DIET's internals and changes from version to version, see
DIETAPI.DOC and DIETTECH.DOC  Those much more technical documents
are of no importance to the average USER of DIET, but are avail-
able for programmers and the curious.



2.0.  A QUICK INTRODUCTION TO WHAT DIET CAN DO.


2.1.  OVERVIEW.  For our discussion, it is useful to classify
DOS files into three general types:


       ∙  EXECUTABLE, i.e., ???.EXE and ???.COM


       ∙  DEVICE DRIVERS, e.g., ???.SYS or ???.DRV


       ∙  DATA, e.g. ???.DOC, ???.TXT, ???.WQ1, etc.


2.1.1.  DIET compresses EXECUTABLES and DRIVERS so that from the
user's perspective they perform the same as if they were not
compressed.  That means you can execute them directly, or load
them from your CONFIG.SYS.  We call this feature selF-eXtracting,
or SFX.


2.1.2.  You can use DIET to compress DATA-type files, but they
are NOT self-extracting.  To use DIETed DATA files, you must
either decompress manually or load DIET as a TSR so that they are
decompressed automatically when your application program loads
them.


2.1.3.  To compress your files on the current directory, simply
type:
                         DIET filename,
or use wildcards, e.g.,
                            DIET *.*
When you use DIET without any options, EXECUTABLES and DRIVERS
are compressed as SFX, and all other files as non-SFX types
files.


2.1.4.  To know whether or not a file has been compressed by
DIET, type:
                             DIET -l
That will display all files in the current directory, with com-
pressed files in reverse color.


2.1.5.  To restore non-SFX compressed files to their uncompressed
status, type
             DIET -r filename.ext,  or  DIET -r *.*


2.1.6.  The simplest -- but not best -- use of DIET would be to
execute both of the following commands in a directory:
                            DIET *.*
followed by
                           DIET -r *.*
That would leave you with EXECUTABLES and DRIVERS in SFX mode,
and all other files (the DATA-type files) uncompressed.


To restore all DIETed files, including compressed executable or
driver files, type
             DIET -ra filename.ext  or  DIET -ra *.*


2.2.  DIET in TSR Mode.
We assume you're displaying DIET.DOC on your console, using
the DOS MORE command, Vernon Buerg's LIST.COM, or your favorite
Editor.  Try the following:


  (a)   Return to DOS.


  (b)   Execute:
                            DIET DIET.DOC
        That will compress this file.  If you now try view the
        file with MORE, or read it with LIST or your favorite
        editor, you'll get garbage.


  (c)   Now Execute:
                                 DIET -Z
        That will load DIET in the TSR mode and allows you to
        display DIET.DOC with MORE, LIST, or your Editor.  Try
        it.


  (d)   Remove the DIET TSR by executing:
                                DIET -ZR


  (e)   Finally, restore (i.e., decompress) DIET.DOC by
        executing:
                           DIET -R DIET.DOC



3.0.  USING DIET's OPTIONS


3.1.  The basic DIET command structure is:
                   DIET [options] [file-names]
                {wild-cards are OK in filenames}
Options require a prefix.  You may use either "-" or "/" as the
option-prefix.  Multiple options must be separated by spaces,
e.g.
                       DIET -z -p -td:\tmp



3.2.  Options fall into two general categories:


  (a)   BASIC options that specify fundamental DIET functions,
        and


  (b)   AUXILIARY Options that modify the operation of a BASIC
        option.


3.3.  The following table summarizes the BASIC and AUXILIARY
Options:

 ------------------------------------------------------------------
 BASIC      Function of the           AUXILIARY Options that can
 Option     BASIC Option              Be used with the BASIC option

 -Z[n]      Load DIET as a TSR. Value    -P,-W,-N,-M
            of [n] defines where in      -S,-Txxxxxx
            memory DIET is loaded.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------
 -ZD        Disable TSR DIET  (also DIET OFF)
 -ZA        Activate TSR DIET (also DIET ON)
 -ZR        Remove TSR DIET from memory.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------



3.4.  The following table summarizes what the file-related
AUXILIARY options do.  Not included in the table are the
AUXILIARY options related to TSR-user of DIET -- they are dis-
cussed at xx, below.  For more details on options, see the full
discussion of options at xx, below.

                   SUMMARY of what FILE-RELATED OPTIONS do.
               -X     Compress as SFX type.
              -XC     Force compression of a .COM file as a real SFX .COM file
               -G     Create a larger SFX header to speed up decompression
               -D     Force compression as DATA type.
               -B     Compare size in Byte count instead Cluster count
               -K     Recompress DATA files upon termination of the
                      application program that uses the files, but not while
                      the application program is running.
               -I     Ignore warning "may be overlay files!"
               -Oxxxx Specify file name or path name of Output.
               -A     Set READ ONLY attribute of the file.


3.5.  AUTOMATIC DECOMPRESSION BY USING DIET AS A TSR.
The general syntax for making DIET terminate & stay resident is:
                      DIET -Z[n] [options]
        -Z    loads DIET into memory as a TSR.  If space is available
              in upper memory (UMB), DIET will try to use it.
              If Expanded memory is available, DIET will try to use it.
              Under DOS 5.0, DIET -Z and DIET -Z1 achieve the same results.

        -Z[n] the [n], if present, tells DIET how to use Expanded Memory.
             -Z0 do not use Expanded Memory (same as -Z alone)
             -Z1 use Expanded Memory for DIET's temporary files.
             -Z2 use Expanded Memory for both DIET's temporary files
                 and for most of DIET's resident code, too.  If you
                 have enough Expanded Memory, -Z2 saves you about 6k
                 bytes of regular memory.

             -ZD   disables DIET in memory, but leaves it loaded.
                   (DIET OFF does the same thing)
             -ZA   restores DIET after -ZD has been used.
                   (DIET ON does the same thing)
             -ZR   removes DIET from memory.  But don't do that if you loaded
                      other TSR's after DIET.

        AUXILIARY options available for use with BASIC option "Z" are:
               -P     automates recompression of DIETed file that has
                      been opened and changed.
               -W     automates compression of newly created file.
               -N     defers automated [re]compression until
                      DIET -$ is issued.
               -M     suppress messages in automated compression.
               -S     display decompressed file size
               -Txxxx specify temporary work directory for DIET's use

        Notes:  After DIET has been loaded as a TSR, additional use
                of "Z[n]" has no effect.  But you can modify DIET's TSR
                functions by using -ZD, -ZA, -ZR, or any of the AUXILIARY
                options, by executing DIET [options] after having
                loaded DIET as a TSR.

                If you compress COMMAND.COM or some overlay files, you must
                make DIET resident in memory.

                Regular users of DIET should include DIET -Z in their
                AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  Alternatively, you can also load DIET
                as a Device Driver, e.g.,
                                DEVICE=DIET.EXE -Z2 -P -K
                That uses a few additional bytes of memory, but allows
                you to DIET Device Drivers (to save disk space).  If you
                have large or many Device Drivers, that may be useful.

                DIET's TSR function may be disabled if ^C or ^Break are used
                while DIET is executing, or by certain interrupts.  If DIET's
                TSR function disappears for an unknown cause, try restoring it
                by typing   DIET -ZA  at the command prompt.



4.0.  Environment Variables.


4.1.  In DOS versions 3.0 and above, DIET uses the following en-
vironment variable strings, if they are present.  You create them
(usually from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file) as follows:
                     SET NameOfEnvVar = data


DIETOPT  lets you define the options you want used as a default,
       e.g.,
                           SET DIETOPT=-D -K
       will use option -D and -K whenever a file is DIETed.
       Options you can set with DIETOPT are: -J,-I,-D,-G,-K,-P,-W,-
       N,&-S


DIETOFF  DIET's ability to automate compression & decompression
       can have certain undesirable effects.  For some programs,
       you may prefer to disable DIET, e.g., to speed up file
       copying without having to use Option -C (see below in
       Sec.5.0.).  By including an environment string as below,
       you tell DIET's TSR not to do what it usually would do
       with DIETed files:
       SET DIETOFF=COMMAND.COM;FC.COM;DUMP.EXE;XCOPY.EXE;LHA.EXE
       You don't need to specify a Path for the files -- DIET is
       concerned only with the programs' names.


NODIET  You should suppress DIETing of some files, e.g., archives
       like *.LZH and *.ZIP, and temporary intermediate files
       created by some application programs.  You can also tell
       DIET to ignore all files in specified directories -- if
       your NODIET string ends with a Directory name, be sure to
       append a "\".  There is a limit of 10 NODIET entries.
       Example:
            SET NODIET=*.LZH;*.ZIP;*.OBJ;C:\TMP\;C:\C600\  
       will suppress DIETing of all *.LZH, *.ZIP, *.OBJ files,
       and of all files in directories C:\TMP and C:\C600.


  TMP  Define storage area for DIET's Temporary Files by putting
       into your AUTOEXEC.BAT a line like:
              SET TMP=E:\DirName     (see also Option -T.)
       NOTE: When you use DIET in resident mode, it creates and
       uses temporary files with names such as __DIET__.??? DIET
       cleans up after itself by erasing such files automatically
       when DIET finishes its tasks, but if you boot your system
       or stop DIET's execution by Ctrl-Break, such files may
       remain on your disk.  You can safely erase any such files.


DIETSIZE  Some programs read in DATA files only to the size ob-
       tained by the Function Call AH=4Eh/4Fh. The environment
       variable:
                   SET DIETSIZE=xxxxxx.COM;xxxxx.EXE
       enables such programs to fully read compressed MSG or HLP
       files.  Because some programs (e.g., SIDEKICK) check
       DATA files by other methods, DIET cannot be used with
       them.  You'll have to experiment.



5.0.  DETAILS ABOUT DIET's OPTIONS, in ALPHABETICAL ORDER


   -!  Makes a self-check of DIET.EXE's internal integrity.


   -$  [Re]compress files whose automatic [re]compression was
       deferred due to use of the -N option (see below).  This
       command is effective only if you specified -N in addition
       to -P and/or -W when you invoked DIET as a TSR.  The
       DIET -$ command MUST be issued before you shutdown your
       system -- it won't do it's job after a reboot.



   -A  Set Read-Only Attribute.  Few users will need to use the
       -A option, but it's there for those who want to be extra
       safe.  It is a safety measure for users who do not always
       keep DIET in memory as a TSR.  If you were to call a
       DIETed file into your editor without DIET in memory, it is
       possible that your editor could lock up.  To restart you
       would have to reboot, and you could lose your DIETed DATA
       file. By using the -A option, you make any DIETed file
       Read-Only.


   -B  Few users will need this option, but it's there for those
       who do.  If you don't fully understand the following
       technical discussion, you don't need this option.
       DIET will not compress files that would -- in their com-
       pressed form -- use the same (or more) CLUSTERs of disk
       space.  (The size of CLUSTERS vary with disks e.g., on a
       High-Density 5.25" disk each CLUSTER consists of 1,024
       bytes).  However, when you archive files with PKZIP or LHA
       using those program's No-Compress options, you might want
       to DIET them first to save as much space as possible.
       The -B option tells DIET to compress the file even if the
       number of CLUSTERS of the DIETed file is the same as the
       un-DIETed version.


   -C  Copying DIETed files with DIET's TSR in memory takes extra
       time because DIETed files are automatically decompressed
       before copying and recompressed after copying.  You can
       suppress that by using DIET with the -C option to copy
       files. The syntax is:
                    DIET -C<destination> <FILENAMEs>

       Example 1.  To copy all files (including compressed files)
       in the current directory of C:\ to Drive A:
                           DIET -CA:\ C:\*.*

       Example 2.  To copy compressed files in drive A: to Drive
       C: and simultaneously decompress them:
                         DIET -RA -CC:\ A:\*.*
       (See also the DIETOFF Environment Variable, above)


   -D  DIET forces compression of any file (incl. xxx.COM &
       xxx.EXE) as a Data type.  If DIET is loaded as a TSR, it
       will decompress such files on-the-fly and will run them.
       Why do this?  What benefit can you get?  Well, you can
       save a little header space in that way (about 100 bytes
       per executable file).  More importantly, programs that
       load themselves into high memory, and programs that use
       many overlays, can be run while DIETed as Data types if
       they won't run after you DIET them using the -I option.
       As with certain other highly-technical options, if you're
       confused by this, just don't use the -D option.


   -E  In its Default mode, DIET expands the file that is opened
       by an application program into a temporary file, and erases
       that temporary file at the termination of the application.
       It is possible for WINDOWS 3.1 or some other DOS Task
       Swapping program to confuse DOS' File Handles and erase
       the original DIETed file instead of the temporary file,
       even if the original file like (*.HLP or *.MSG files) was
       set to R/O (ReadOnly).  The -E option is designed to avoid
       that risk.  Use the -E option ONLY if you experience this
       problem with a particular application.


   -G  You can speed-up self-extraction if you're willing to use
       an extra 100 bytes (about 200 vs. 100) for the SFX header.
       It's worth trying on large executable files, especially
       when the 100 extra bytes don't change the number of
       Clusters used by the DIETed file.  We suggest you experi-
       ment with this option and use it where it's to your
       benefit.


   -H  Make an integrity check of a DIETed file using a CRC
       algorithm, and determine whether the -K option was used
       when the file was DIETed.


   -I  Ignore warnings.  DIET ordinarily refuses to compress
       files with overlays when the size of the file in EXEHDR is
       not the same as the file's actual size, or when a file is
       to be loaded into high-memory (e.g., ADDRV.EXE).  But
       since DIETed overlay files can be used when DIET is in its
       TSR mode, you can use the -I option to force DIET to com-
       press the files anyway.
       DO NOT USE THIS OPTION UNLESS YOU LOAD DIET AS A TSR!!!


   -J  Ignore this option unless you are using JDOS4.0 from IBM-
       Japan and can read Japanese.


   -K  Kill temporary Files Only on Quitting Program.
       In its TSR mode, DIET opens a temporary file whenever a
       program like an editor opens a compressed file.  In its
       default mode, DIET erases the temporary file when the
       program closes it. Some programs open, close, and reopen
       files frequently, e.g. a Help Message file, or communica-
       tions software with overlay protocol files.  That can be
       very time consuming.  To avoid that, DIET such files using
       the -K option -- then the temporary files will be erased
       ONLY when you quit the main program from which the DIETed
       files were expanded.

    -L [filename.ext] presents a directory listing for the
       default disk, with the DIETed files in reverse color.  An
       "#" means the file has a self-extracting header, and a "*"
       means it is compressed as a DATA file.  If you add a
       filename and filetype, you restrict the search to the
       defined files.  Wildcard filenames are OK, e.g.,
                             DIET -L *.EXE
       DIET -L's default is the same as DIET -L *.*


   -M  If you don't want DIET to give you a message about what it
       is doing to your file, suppress the message with -M


   -N  When the -W and/or -P options are specified when DIET is
       loaded as a TSR, DIET automatically compresses newly
       created files and recompresses files that are not set to
       READ ONLY.  Specifying the -N option when DIET is loaded
       as a TSR delays auto-compression and recompression until
                                DIET -$
       is issued to instruct DIET to recompress changed files
       and/or compress newly created files.  The time stamp of
       the compressed files is set to when they were closed, NOT
       to when they were actually compressed. This option is
       useful if you don't want DIET to take time to recompress
       files as you work, but prefer to have DIET do its job when
       you're ready to quit.  The DIET -$ command works only if
       you use it BEFORE you reboot.


   -O  By default, DIET overwrites the files it compresses (or
       uncompresses).  If you want to save the uncompressed (or
       compressed) file, use the -O option to put the changed
       file into another directory.  To illustrate:

       Example 1. You are NOT logged into DRIVE A:.  You want a
       compressed version of A:ALPHA.DAT in your default
       directory:
                          DIET -O A:alpha.dat.

       Example 2. You want to compress ALPHA.DAT in your default
       directory and store the compressed file in directory C:\TMP
                         DIET -OC:\tmp\ alpha.dat
          (note the positions of the spaces and back slashes!!)


   -P  Use this option to automatically recompress changed DIETed
       files, because in its default mode DIET does not re-
       compress DATA files that were changed after being loaded
       and manipulated by a program such as an Editor or a
       Spreadsheet.  DIET -P enables automatic recompression.
       Note: DIET's ability to automatically recompress DATA
       files depends on your Editor's internal workings.
       Experiment!


   -S  Some application programs read in a specified amount of
       data from overlay or other files, and get confused if
       those files have been DIETed.  Specifying the -S option
       when DIETing avoids that problem.  We suggest ALWAYS using
       the -S option if you are going to archive files using LHA,
       PKZIP, or PKARC.  There are no circumstances in which it
       is disadvantageous to use the -S option -- we suggest
       using -S when invoking DIET as a TSR.


   -T  In its default mode, DIET stores in the default directory
       certain temporary files that it creates and needs. If you
       use the Environment Variable  TMP=??? (as may be required
       by various programs), DIET will attempt to store its tem-
       porary files in the directory that you've defined as ???.
       To force DIET to use a particular directory for its tem-
       porary files, use the -T option on the DIET line in your
       AUTOEXEC.BAT file, e.g.
                         DIET -Z2 -TD:\tmp1\  
               DO NOT FORGET THE LAST "\" IN THIS OPTION.
       The -T option is especially useful if you define a RAM
       DISK directory as the recipient of DIET's temporary files.


   -W  Automatically DIETs all newly-created files, including any
       temporary files that your programs may create.  That can
       be useful but can also waste time.  To avoid this option
       becoming a nuisance, use the NODIET Environmental Variable
       to suppress DIETing of files like *.OBJ, *.LZH. Or use -N
       option together, and issue the command
                                DIET -$
       before you quit your session.


   -X  As a default, DIET recognizes as device drivers all files
       with the extensions "SYS" or "DRV" and does NOT compress
       them.  If you want to DIET a Device Driver, you must make
       it self-extracting (because you won't have DIET in memory
       as a TSR until you load it as a TSR in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
       file). You can force DIET to add a self-extracting header
       to any file by using the -X option.  But see also option
       -I, above.


  -XC  DIET always compresses a .COM file into .EXE file and
       renames it as .COM.  You need not be concerned about this.
       If you have a particular reason to want DIET to produce a
       real .COM file, you can force that by using this option.
       But be sure to experiment -- the behavior of such a .COM
       file may be unpredictable.


-Z[?]  See Sec.3.5., above.



6.0.  CONCLUDING REMARKS.


6.1.  Don't allow DIET to be memory-resident when using HardDisk
Managers like SPEEDDSK, OPTIMIZE, DOG.  Disable DIET by executing
DIET -ZD when you use such programs!!  In fact, it's always best
to clear ALL TSRs before using such programs.


6.2.  If you elect NOT to make DIET memory-resident:


  (a)   Remember to manually decompress Data-type files before
        using them.  You could simplify that by using Batch files
        to decompress the Data-type files and then invoking your
        application program from the Batch file.


  (b)   When using a Laptop with a Ramdisk, a useful technique is
        to store your application program and related Data files
        on a floppy and transfer them to the Ramdisk (e.g.,
        Drive D:) with:
                           DIET -r -CD: a:*.*
        When you're done, exit from the application program and
        do:
                             DIET -CA: D:*.*
        That will compress the revised Data files and store them,
        together with the application program, on A:.  Of course,
        you must have enough room on A: to accept the revised
        files.


6.3.  With DIET memory-resident:


  (a)   Specifying a RAM disk for DIET's temporary files speeds
        up DIET's operation -- see the -T option, above.


  (b)   You may see a message like: "Can't find abc.exe" even
        though the file exists.  This is usually the result of
        DIET being unable to find enough space in your temporary
        directory for its temporary files. Check the space in the
        appropriate directory (the Default directory, of the
        defined TMP directory) if you get this message.


  (c)   DIETOPT variables modify DIET to avoid certain un-
        desirable effects, like decompressing files before copy-
        ing them and then recompressing those files after
        copying.  To optimize DIET's performance in YOUR
        application, experiment with the -C, -P, -W, and -K
        options.


  (d)   Word processors frequently write files back to disk
        before you exit them, and create auxiliary files for
        formatting or controlling a printer.  If you use the -P
        option, that can take a lot of time for compressing and
        decompressing these files. By specifying the -K option,
        you defer all that DIETing until you exit the word
        processor.  If you have plenty of space on your Hard Disk
        or Ram Disk, it's easiest to specify -K when you load
        DIET as a TSR.  If you're short of disk space, be selec-
        tive about the files that are DIETed with the -K option,
        by specifying -K when you DIET files that you want to
        remain expanded until you quit a particular application
        program.


  (e)   The -P option is highly-desirable when you always use
        DIET as a TSR, especially when appropriately used in
        conjunction with -K. You may enjoy being reminded of the
        space you're saving when you quit your application (DIET
        tells you what it's doing).  If you don't want to be
        reminded, use the -M option to tell DIET to do its work
        quietly.


  (f)   You can force DIET to compress executable files that use
        overlays (and the overlays themselves) when you use DIET
        as a TSR.  To do that, use the -K option and the -D op-
        tion when DIETING such files.


  (g)   You can toggle DIET on and off with "DIET ON" and DIET
        OFF". Those commands also tell you the status of various
        options.


  (h)   DIET tries to keep track of filenames even with DOS 5.0's
        task-swapping, or Windows in its enhanced mode. However,
        you may find some application programs for which DIET
        fails to trace tasks swapped.  Take due precautions with
        task swapping -- experiment before relying on using DIET
        with them.
