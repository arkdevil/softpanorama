	     g   Sets group permissions.
	     o   Sets other permissions.
	     a   Sets all permissions; this is the default.

	     +   Turns on a permission.
	     -   Turns off a permission.
	     =   Turns on the specified permissions and turns off all others.

	     s   Setuid/Setgid bit. On MSDOS and OS/2 this maps to the
	         SYSTEM attribute.
	     t   Text bit.  On MSDOS and OS/2 this maps to the ARCHIVED
	         attribute.

    absolute mode

	    A octal value made up using by ORing the following values.  Note
	    that some values may be invalid.  These are translated into the
	    appropriate MSDOS/OS2 values.

		4000   HIDDEN Attribute
		2000   SYSTEM Attribute
		1000   ARCHIVE Attribute
		0400   User read. Ignored on MSDOS and OS/2

		0001   Other execute. Ignored on MSDOS and OS/2

	    If the last character is a d (as in 001d), the absolute DOS
	    values listed below are assumed and no translation takes place.

	    001 - Read only
	    002 - Hidden
	    004 - system
	    040 - Archived
