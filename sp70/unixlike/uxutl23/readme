UXUTL23?.zip		1 September 94

This is a new set of UNIX utilities for use with MS Shell 2.x.  It fixes a
number of bugs in the earlier release (2.2).  The documentation is minimal
(in true UNIX style, and even worse that UNIX) and assumes that you are
familiar with the original UNIX command set.  The usage file list the
command usage and the meaning of the switches.  If you want more detail, I
recommend the appropriate UNIX manual pages.  The command set has move
towards conforming with X/Open, POSIX etc.

The archive comes in 4 files (a,b,c,d).

As far as possible, I've maintained the UNIX semantics of a command.
Obviously somethings don't work (links - symbolic or hard, groups, users
etc) and somethings have changed slighty to support MSDOS (support for
drives etc).

Some of the command support raw disks and floppies to a degree (cpio, dd).
The filename for a raw disk is /dev/hdxy and /dev/fdx for a floppy where x
is the unit number and y is the partition (numbered from 1, partition 0 is
the whole disk unit).  Thus: dd=/dev/hd00 count=1 bs=512 of=x copies the
boot sector from unit 0 to file x.

All these commands support MS Shell's indirect command file option (see the 
Command Line Building section in its manual page.  If the command is given
a parameter @filename, it reads the commands from filename, one per line.
A \ at the end of the line escapes the newline and continues the current
parameter from the next line, also see LINK and LIB.  This means you have a
entry of the form name = unix in the ${EXTENDED_LINE} file).

Without MS Shell, they support UNIX style wildcards (*?[]) and assume UNIX
style directory separators (/ not \).  \ is the escape next character
character!

As an aside:	MSDOS itself doesn't care whether you use / or \ as the
		directory separator, it is the commands (command.com
		backup.com etc) which care and only because / is the
		switch character.

I'm not really into supporting these commands (mainly because I'm supposed
to do some real work to earn money most of my time).  However, if you send
me a bug report, I'll try and fix it and send you a new release.  But don't
expect regular updates to this archive.

All the code (as far as I'm aware) is either ported Public Domain sources
from the net or stuff I've written myself.  

Please try not to ask me for the source, because at the moment it is
expensive for us to send large mail packages.  If you are interested in how
a command works, I recommend you look at the GNU utility set which contains
most of these commands (not that my stuff is the GNU version, I hasten to
add).

Oh, yes,  you will probably need to set up the following environment
variables (I've shown you the values I use.  Change them to match your
environment):

    HOME=c:/			# The root directory
    TERM=ibmpc-color		# The terminal type
    TERMCAP=c:/etc/termcap	# The location of the termcap file
    TMP=c:/tmp			# The location for temporary files.
    TZ=GMT0GMT			# Your timezone

Other than that, have fun.
