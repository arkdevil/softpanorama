                               DesqView Support


Version 2.55 of CronJr introduces DesqView time slice relinquishment.

This means that if CronJr is running in a DesqView window and CronJr is
not running a job, CronJr will relinquish the remaining portion of its
allocated time slice.

This can lead to a 100% or better performance increase.  This increase
depends on the number of DesqView windows running CronJr and how you
have allocated time slices to individual windows.

To put this claim to the test do the following.  You will need Norton
Utilities' SI program or equivalent system performance tester.

Before starting DesqView, run SI.  Our test clone 33mhz 486 shows a
computing index (CI) of 51.6 .

Run Desqview and run SI from within a DOS window.  Our test showed a
CI of 50.1 .

Open another DOS window and run an old version of CronJr ( versions
below 2.55 ).  Run SI back in the DOS window and look at the CI.  Our
tests showed 24.3 .

Terminate the old CronJr and start up the new CronJr version 2.55 or
greater.  Before CronJr starts launching applications, switch
back to the DOS window and run SI.  Our tests showed a CI of 50.0, 
better than %100 faster than the original 24.3 .

These tests were done with even time slicing in foreground and
background windows.  Your results may vary.

DesqView time slice relinquishment is done automatically and cannot be
overridden.  If this increase in performance adversely impacts your
system then your only resort is to run one of the versions prior to
2.55.  We have included some old versions of CRON.EXE in the
\VERSIONS directory on the distribution disk.  If you need to use
one of these older versions, delete or rename the CRON.EXE file on your
hard drive and copy one of the files - say CRON251.EXE - to your hard
drive as CRON.EXE .
