                   Windows 3.1 .pif and .ico file support.

  0. Make the assumption you installed CronJr in the c:\cron directory.

  1. Complete the standard DOS CronJr installation ( cron start... ).

  2. Copy the CronJr.pif file into your windows directory ( c:\win31 ).

  3. Copy the CronJr.ico file into your cronjr directory ( c:\cron ).

  4. Start up Windows and bring up the PIF Editor.  Load the CronJr.pif
     file and edit the Start Up Path directory to point to the location
     of the CronJr.Bat file ( c:\cron ).

  5. Go to your Windows Applications window, or other window and create
     a new file by selection the "File" item, then "New" and select
     "Program Item" then click on "Ok".  Fill in the remaining items
     as shown below:

       Description: CronJr
       Command Line: CronJr.pif
       Working Directory: c:\cron  ( or wherever you installed CronJr  )
       Check "Run Minimized"

     Click on "Change Icon".  You will be told there are no icons, click
     "Ok" and browse into the c:\cron directory.  Select the CronJr.ico
     file.  Click on "Ok" until you are at your "Applications Window".

  6. CronJr is ready for windows.  Our defaults eat up lots of memory,
     which in most cases is correct.  Our defaults also run in the
     background.  You may need to modify the CronJr.pif file to suit
     your needs.


  The above instructions and support files are just that - support.
  We do not sell CronJr as a Windows application, nor do we claim
  to be experts in the optimization of Windows for DOS applications.
  With that aside, you should find the DOS CronJr program to be a very
  stable Windows application.
