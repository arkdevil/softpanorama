07/14/94 - Version 2.55 fixes the problem when pressing F1 when the
           DOS shell is disabled.  Pressing F1 would incorrectly
           cause immediate evaluation.

11/26/93 - Version 2.51 increases the number of entries allowed in the
           CronJr.sch file.  We thought it was unlimited, but we
           were wrong.  Version 2.50 will hang immediately if there are
           70 or more entries in the schedule file.  This was due to
           compiling in the tiny memory mode, which only allows 64k
           for program and code.  The other problem was that memory
           for the schedule was being calloc'd as a block.  Calloc'd
           blocks are currently limited to 64k, thus limiting the
           number of entries in the schedule file.  The calloc'd blocks
           have been replaced with linked lists, and the memory mode
           has been changed to compact, which allows 1 meg for data.
           After all these changes, there still is a limit to the
           number of items in the CronJr.sch file - about 840 for a
           machine with 490k free.

03/05/93 - Version 2.49 fixes the ROOT installation problems.  The
           CronJr.BAT file was writing incorrectly writing two \'s
           for directory changes and program execution.

           Version 2.48 changed the immediate evalation key from ENTER
           to  E  .  People were experiencing problems on Novell networks
           where their CronJr scripts were logging in and out of networks.
           They were experiencing anywhere from 1 to 10 executions per
           minute.  This was due to a "feature" of both the Netware login
           script and CronJr.  Some Netware login scripts stuff an
           ENTER into the keyboard upon returning to DOS.  That ENTER
           was being interpreted by CRONJR as an immediate schedule
           evaulation and thus resulting in another execution of the
           CronJr job.  By changing the immediate evaluation key from
           ENTER to  E  fixed this problem.

05/16/92 - Some non 100% Microsoft compatable command interpreters may
           cause problems with the creation of the CronJr.LOG file.
           The CronJr.LOG file is created via the DOS command line using
           the  >>  output redirectors.  The  >>  redirector appends to
           a file.  Some Command.COM substitutes such as some versions
           of 4DOS do not work properly.  The  >>  redirector in 4DOS
           always creates a file, rather than appending to a file.
           This problem may not be limited to 4DOS.  It is easy to test
           for this problem by typing the following at your DOS prompt.

            c:\> echo does >  kk
            c:\> echo this >> kk
            c:\> echo work >> kk

           The resulting file named KK should contain 3 lines.

05/11/92 - Due to a bug in the Borland Turbo C 1.5 time functions, the
           clock would jump 1 hour on April 28, 1992 at 2:00 am and
           remain 1 hour ahead until April 29, 1992 at 2:00 am when it
           would jump back an hour.  This bug has been acknowledged by
           Borland and the CronJr and TimeNow programs have been
           recompiled with a later release of the C compiler.
           Wildcarded minutes are no longer valid.  The problem of mixing
           incremental minutes and hours has been fixed and limited by
           the EditCron program.

08/25/91 - Versions 2.24 and 2.25 were writing garbage parameters into the
           CRONWK.BAT file.  It worked great as long as you only had one
           entry in the CRONJR.SCH file.  Changed token scanning code and
           tested and tested and tested.

08/01/91 - Installation process ( CRON START ) was not working correctly
           for DOS versions 4.0 and above.  CronJr treated DOS 4.0 and
           higher as if it was a version below 3.3.   Oops.  We plead
           stupidity.  If you have DOS version 4.0 or above, and have
           installed CRONJR, you should recreate the CRONJR.BAT file
           by running CRON START with the new version of CRON .
