FILEC15.DOC

Since releasing Filec v1.02 into the public domain I have had 
many comments from users including suggestions for enhancements
and reports of problems.

I have sent several people the source code and recently I received
a revised version (1.04) from Seth Chailkin (psykseth@aau.dk). Seth
is responsible for all the new features including filename listing,
DOS 5 compatiablity and cleaning up the command line interface, and
I'd like to particularly thank him for his efforts. 

Since then I have fixed up some more minor bugs and polished a 
few more rought corners and now I'm releasing Filec v1.05 back into
the public domain.

Any comments or suggestions you have will be greatfully received
by both Seth and myself, and the source is freely avaliable for 
the asking.

NEW FEATURES:

+ Matching Filename Listings

    If the hotkey is pressed twice with the same partial filename
    then filec will list the possible matches (if there are any).

    This emulates ^D in [t]csh or bash.

+ Operates under DOS 4.x and DOS 5.x

    The previous release of filec went splat after DOS 3.3.

+ Sister utility called SHOWKEY

    A convient way to find the key mask and scan code for
    selected hotkeys.

MINOR NEW FEATURES:

+ Error checking for scancode and keymask values
	(a) must be a number; (b) must be appropriate value

+ English feedback about new hotkey combination 

+ Case insensitive in reading commands 

+ Changed the "beeping" rules.

	- No beep on match (rationale: don't like a beeping PC)
	- Encouraging beep on partial match (i.e., higher)
	- Lowest beep on no match.

+ Will install with only "filec" 

	(Given that V 1.02 would install with (filec parameter)
	It seemed arbitrary to have an "install" command.

+ Can now change multiple parameters after filec is resident.


"BUG" FIXES

+ Does not match on /  (added test in suck_screen() in filec.c)

+ Does not "install" filec if a 'filec quit' is the first command given.
  
+ If installed as "filec sleep" then really sleeps

+ Runs on DOS 4+ with enhanced keyboards 

+ removed adjustable freq and made beeps is machine independant.
