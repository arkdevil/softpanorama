			   File Name Completion
			   --------------------

			      Richard Miller


    FILEC  is Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR)  utility that reduces 
    the number of keystrokes needed to enter long filenames. When the 
    HOTKEY is pressed FILEC reads a partial filename as typed by  the 
    user  and  attempts  to  complete the filename  by  seaching  the 
    appropriate  directory.  The completed filename is then pasted by 
    FILEC, as if the user had typed it. 

      e.g.   C:\ type au<HOT_KEY>
	     C:\ type autoexec.bat

	If  FILEC  can not find a unique completion it only pastes as 
    much  as is common to the multiple completions.   The  user  then    
    must  type  an  extra letter and try again.   For example if  the 
    current directory contains both COMMAND.COM and  CONFIG.SYS  then 
    following will occur. 
	
	    C:\ dir c<HOT_KEY>
	    C:\ dir co

    The user must then add either the M or N depend on what she wants.

	    C:\ dir com<HOT_KEY>
	    C:\ dir command.com

    If the partial filename doesn't match any existing filename  then 
    FILEC will paste nothing at all and merely beep at you. 

	    C:\ type phantom<HOT_KEY>
	    C:\ type phantom

    FILEC  also completes directory names in the same  manner.    For 
    example  if  you have a disk with two levels  of  subdirectoryies 
    then the following is possible. 

	    C:\ dir A:\ba<HOT_KEY>
	    C:\ dir A:\basement

    Notice that FILEC recognizes the disk drive specified was A:  and 
    searches  accordingly.    You can then add to what FILEC has just 
    added. 

	    C:\ dir A:\basement\ca<HOT_KEY>
	    C:\ dir A:\basement\carpark

    FILEC also understands parent and root directories.

	    A:\CARPARK\ type ..\carpark\j<HOT_KEY>
	    A:\CARPARK\ type ..\carpark\jaguar.xjs


    Installing FILEC
    ----------------

    First  place  a  copy  of FILEC.EXE somewhere in  your  path  (or 
    alternatively  you  can  specify a full  pathname  when  you  run 
    FILEC).   Then to install FILEC run FILEC.EXE at the  DOS  prompt 
    with the "install" option. 

	     C:\ filec install
     
	     FILE going resident ....

	     C:\

    FILEC  will make itself resident and the DOS prompt will  return. 
    If  FILEC is subsequently run again it will recognize that it  is 
    already  installed  and will not go resident  again  however  the 
    options are passed to the resident copy. 

	     C:\ file nobeep

	     FILEC: patched resident code

	     C:\

    FILEC will now respond when ever the HOT_KEY is pressed.

    NOTE:  FILEC reads the partial filename directly from the  screen 
    from  current cursor postion backwards until the first space, ">"
    , "<" or "|".   This means that conmpletion  will not work if the
    partial filename is butted against some other letters.
		  
	    C:PROMPTcomm<HOT_KEY>      {will not work} 
	    C:PROMPTcomm

	    C:PROMPT comm<HOT_KEY>     {will work}
	    C:PROMPT command.com
		  
    A  neat solution  to this  problem is to add a ">" to the end of 
    your prompt string in your autoexec.bat
		  
	    "set prompt=$p$g>"
                        

    Command Line Options
    --------------------

    There  are  a  number of options that user can  specify  via  the 
    command line.   All the options can be set at once when initially 
    installing FILEC but only one option can be given when  modifying 
    FILEC once it is resident. 

    If FILEC is run with no options it displays a brief usage message 
    and termainates. 

	install
	------- 

	Specifies  that you want FILEC to go resident.  The option is 
	implied if you specify any other option. 

	sleep (not default)
	-----

	Specifies  that  you  want FILEC to  stay  resident  but  not 
	active.   While FILEC is sleeping it will not respond to  the 
	HOT_KEY. 

	awake (default)
	-----

	This  option  jolts FILEC out of sleep mode  and  FILEC  will 
	subsequently respond to the HOT_KEY. 

	beep (default)
	----

	Turns on sound effects.  FILEC uses three different beeps. The 
	first  beep  indicates that multiple  completions  have  been 
	found,  the second indicates no completions can be found, and 
	the third indicates a unique completion has been found. 

	nobeep (not default)
	------

	Turns beeps off.

	freq f
	------

	Allows you to change the frequency (pitch) of the beeps.  The
	actual sound is dependent on you machine's speed. The default
	value for f is 100.

	window (not default)
	------

	Turns window mode on.   In window mode every time the HOT_KEY 
	is  pressed a window pops to show what is about to be pasted.  
	(See WINDOW MODE) 

	nowindow (default)
	--------

	Turns window mode off.

	win y x
	-------

	Specifies the x y coordinates of the top left hand corner  of 
	the window. (default 15,3)  eg file win 10 10

	hotkey scan mask
	----------------

	Allows you to specify different hotkeys. Default (Ctrl-SPACE).



    WINDOW MODE
    -----------

    When  FILEC  is  in WINDOW mode it pops a window every  time  the 
    HOT_KEY  is  press.   The window shows the partial  filename  the 
    completion found and the number of matches found. 

    You  then have the option aborting by pressing ESC or pasting  by 
    pressing  any  other they.   The key pressed is  also  pasted  to 
    minimize keystrokes.  If you press ENTER to paste the  completion 
    the ENTER is not pasted. 


    HOT_KEY
    -------

    The HOT_KEY is specified by two numbers - a ScanCode and KeyMask.
    The ScanCode specifies which key will cause FILEC to POP and  the
    KeyMask specifies  what state the  CTRL/ALT/SHIFTS/LOCKS/INS must
    in when the ScanCode key is struck.

    To determine the scan code of a particular key, look it up in the
    following table.  To determine the KeyMask value add together all
    the values for the things you want from the Keyboard Status Mask.

    The default HOT_KEY is Ctrl-SPACE and there for has

	    Scancode = 57    (SPACE)
	    KeyMask  = 4     (Value For CTRL)

    From The Author
    ---------------

    FileC was inspired by file name completion facilities offered
    in a number of *Unix* shells, including csh and tcsh. I found
    it very frustrating to return to DOS after using these shells
    so I set about writting a TSR to do the job. Now I have FileC 
    in all my AUTOEXEC.BATs (it turned out to be actually useful
    to my supprize).

    FILEC has been released into the PUBLIC DOMAIN.

    You are free to distribute this  program amongst your friends
    and co-workers for non-commercial purposes.  If you like this
    File Completion Utility and find it valuable then please let
    me know. This will encourage me to continue developement and
    deployment of other utilites.

    If you have received FileC over the Internet, and have given
    it a whirl please drop me some email.  A simple 2 line message
    would be enough, just so I can keep track of where my creations 
    get to.

    Any comments/bug reports/suggestion would also be greatly 
    appreciated. If there is sufficient interest or you ask me
    I'm happy to distribute the source code as well - which is
    almost entirely written in Turbo C.
