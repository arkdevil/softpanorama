        1 INTRODUCTION



        1.1 Product Description

        This is version 1.8 of CRON.

        CRON is a timed command dispatcher that closely implements all the
        features of the UNIX 'cron' utility that make sense in a DOS
        environment.

        CRON reads a special file at startup, conventionally called CRONTAB,
        where each entry defines a time and a command to execute at that time.
        All commands are periodic, i.e. one-shot commands are not possible. The
        longest period is one year, however, so this is not considered a
        problem. In a PC environment, a command with a 1-year period is a one-
        shot command for all practical purposes.

        After a command has executed, CRON re-calculates its next execution
        time, then sorts the command list in time order and waits until the
        first command in the list is due for execution. This sequence is
        repeated undefinitely (or until the user stops CRON).

        CRON optionally logs its activites in a file conventionally called
        CRONLOG. The layout of this file is more or less identical to the UNIX
        cronlog and conveys the same information. The cronlog maintains an
        accurate track of CRON's activities. A startup option is available to
        make CRON lock the log file during access, allowing several
        workstations on a network to run CRON with a central logfile on the
        server.

        CRON works well with DESQview. Under DESQview, the background operation
        of UNIX cron can be emulated by letting CRON run by itself in a (small)
        window. Indeed, CRON was originally developed for use with DESQview.
        See chapter 7 for instructions on using CRON with DESQview, and for
        information about the special CRONDV program for spawning xx-pif.dvp
        files.

        Although based on UNIX cron, CRON is developed from scratch and
        contains no proprietary code.

        CRON.EXE has been reported to work fine with Microsoft Windows 3.0,
        although I have not tested this.

        1.2 Shareware

        CRON is shareware (aka. User Supported Software). This means that you
        may freely use CRON for a reasonable evaluation period. You may also
        freely distribute CRON18.ZIP in unmodified form, to BBS'es or
        otherwise.

        If, after a reasonable evaluation period, you find CRON useful, I would
        appreciate a contribution. NOK 150 (USD 25) suggested.

        All the usual disclaimers about damages, fitness for any particular
        purpose and all that apply. In brief, you use CRON at your own risks
        and perils.

        1.3 Acknowledgements

        Thanks to Thomas Wagner, Berlin, Germany for his EXEC routines (public
        domain software, available as EXEC23.LZH on many BBS'es), on which
        CRON's swap logic is based, and to Borland International for their
        splendid debugger.

        Thanks to Julian Templeton, London, for suggesting the new character
        escape facility.



        1.4 System Requirements

        CRON runs on any IBM PC compatible computer under the DOS operating
        system, version 3 or later. CRON requires a minimum of 46KB of free
        memory to load, more for large CRONTABS. The special version CRONDV.EXE
        runs on the same hardware but only under DESQview.



        1.5 Feedback

        Your comments, suggestions and bug reports are most welcome. Since CRON
        implements all the features of UNIX cron that make sense in a DOS
        environment, new functionality is not likely to be added if not
        sollicited by users. Bug reports, on the other hand, is a different
        story.

        This archive should contain the following files:

          -    CRON.EXE,      the executable program
          -    CRONDV.EXE,    special executable for running DESQview
                              xx-PIF.DVP files, see chapter 7.
          -    CRON.DOC,      this document
          -    CRONTAB,       annotated sample crontab
          -    CRONTAB.DV,    annotated sample crontab for CRONDV
          -    LOGCHECK.EXE,  let CRON control its log size
          -    CDD.EXE        smarter CHDIR command
          -    READ.ME        list of fixes and new features in this version



        2.2 Installing CRON

        Copy CRON.EXE/CRONDV.EXE to a directory in the DOS PATH (e.g. c:\bin).

        Create a directory for CRON's use, for example C:\CRON.

        This directory should be used for crontabs and log files.

        Create your crontab using the supplied CRONTAB as a template. Read the
        rest of this document for more information about crontabs. Put your
        crontab in the directory you created.



        2.3 Setting up CRON's environment

        CRON recognizes several environment variables. These are:

          CRONTAB   if set, CRON assumes it contains the name of a file that is
                    to be used as the crontab. This can be overridden on the
                    command line. Typically, this environment variable will
                    contain C:\CRON\CRONTAB.

          CRONLOG   required if you want CRON to log its operations. Set to the
                    name of the logfile (e.g. C:\CRON\CRONLOG). Note that
                    CRONLOG must point to a fully qualified file name,
                    including drive/path. This is required since the commands
                    that CRON execute may change the logged drive and/or
                    directory.

          TZ        indirectly consulted by the time management functions of
                    the run-time library. This variable must be set as follows:
                    TZ=zzzN where 'zzz' is the name of the time zone, for
                    example CET (Continental European Time) and N is the signed

        CRON User's Guide            Rev. 01-15-92                       Page 4


                    number of hours your time is after GMT. For example, the
                    correct setting for Central Europe is TZ=CET-1, since
                    Central Europe is 1 hour before GMT. In America, N should
                    be a positive number since America is after GMT. If your
                    time zone practices daylight saving, be sure to set the DOS
                    clock using TIME whenever you change to and from daylight
                    saving time.

          TMP       if CRON is run in swap mode, it will swap most of itself
                    out of memory when executing commands. By default, CRON
                    will swap to a temporary file in the directory named by the
                    TMP variable, or in the current directory if the TMP
                    directory does not exist. If you have a RAM disk with 50-
                    70K of free space, set TMP to the name of directory on this
                    RAM disk. The directory used for swapping can be overridden
                    on the command line.

          COMSPEC   when CRON needs to spawn COMMAND.COM, it will use the name
                    contained in this variable, which is normally
                    C:\COMMAND.COM. Other shells, like 4DOS, can be used by
                    setting COMSPEC appropriately.


          CRONPIF   see chapter 7.5. This is the directory where CRONDV looks
                    for xx-pif.dvp files to execute.


        Setting these environment variables allows you to start CRON with the
        appropriate environment by simply typing CRON.

        Here's a selected part of my AUTOEXEC.BAT:

          SET CRONTAB=d:\cron\crontab
          SET CRONLOG=d:\cron\cronlog
          SET TMP=m:\tmp
          SET TZ=CET-1



        2.4 Set Your Clock

        CRON will not operate as expected if the DOS date and time are not set
        correctly. In particular, remember to update your clock when switching
        to and from daylight saving time.

        3 USING CRON


        See chapter 7 for further instructions regarding CRONDV.EXE.



        3.1 Command-line Summary

        CRON is started as follows:

          CRON [option] [option] ...


        As a special case, entering "CRON ?" will display an option summary and
        terminate.

        The available options are:

          -c tab    -- override CRONTAB name
          -n        -- no log
          -s        -- swap mode
          -e        -- swap to LIM/EMS memory if possible
          -d dir    -- swap directory override
          -v        -- verbose mode
          -l        -- lock CRONLOG when accessing if on network drive
          -L        -- always lock CRONLOG when accessing



        3.2 Crontab override -- the '-c tab' option

        This option overrides the name that CRON will use for the crontab.
        'tab' must be the name of an existing file. Full drive/path syntax or
        relative syntax may be used.

        In the absence of this option, CRON will look for the crontab as
        follows:

          -    if the CRONTAB environment variable is set, use that name
          -    otherwise, look in the directory that was current when CRON was
               started for the file name "CRONTAB".

        CRON will complain and abort if it cannot find a crontab.

        Example (friday afternoon):

          cron -c d:\cron\weekend

        Note that CRON only reads the crontab at startup.

        3.3 Disable logging -- the '-n' option

        If CRON is set up for logging, this option disables logging. If CRON
        would not have logged anyway the option is ignored.

        Logging is only done if the environment variable CRONLOG is set to a
        fully qualified filename (i.e. with full drive/path syntax).

        CRON will complain if CRONLOG is set but does not point to a fully
        qualified filename.



        3.4 Swap Mode -- the '-s', '-d dir' and '-e' options

        CRON may optionally swap most of itself out of memory when executing
        other commands. This feature is enabled by entering the -s option.

        CRON will by default swap to a temporary file, either in the TMP
        directory if set, or in the directory that was current when CRON was
        started.

        The -e option will make CRON try to swap itself to LIM/EMS memory, if
        present and available in sufficient quantities. See chapter 7 for a
        discussion of memory requirements. If EMS swapping is not possible,
        CRON reverts to disk swapping.

        The '-d dir' option will make CRON swap to a temporary file in the
        directory 'dir' instead of the standard places described above.

        CRON complains if it sees -d or -e but not -s, and if 'dir' is not a
        valid directory.



        3.5 Verbose mode -- the '-v' option

        This option requires that an ANSI driver be present in your system,
        e.g. ANSI.SYS, or DVANSI.COM under DESQview.

        The effect of -v is that CRON maintains a real time display showing the
        next command scheduled for execution, the time it will be executed, and
        the time left (in seconds) until the command is executed.

        CRON User's Guide            Rev. 01-15-92                       Page 7


        3.6 Locking the logfile -- the '-L' and '-l' options

        If one of these options is entered, CRON will lock byte 0 of the
        logfile before accessing it, using the DOS 3.1 locking calls.

        CRON uses the IOCTL Is Redirected Handle call to determine if the
        logfile is on a network drive. Your DOS version must support this call
        (DOS function 44H, subfunction 0AH) for logfile locking to work with
        the '-l' option. If you enter the '-L' option CRON will not check if
        the file is remote but will always try to lock it. This is useful if
        you have loaded SHARE.EXE on the local machine.

        Most networks support the DOS 3.1 locking calls. CRON has also been
        tested and found to work fine on a Novell NetWare network.

        If your network does not support the way CRON goes about locking the
        logfile, CRON will still work but will simply disable logfile locking.

        If a lock call fails (either because of a timeout or because you used
        the '-L' option and the locking call failed), CRON will print a
        timestamped error message and disable locking and verbose mode.



        3.7 Stopping CRON

        CRON is stopped by typing ESC. CRON reminds you of this at startup.



        3.8 Startup Information

        When CRON starts, it will print a banner consisting of the program
        name, version, copyright, memory available after CRON has processed the
        crontab and grabbed what it needs, and a reminder that you should hit
        ESC to stop CRON.

        If CRON believes that it runs under DESQview, it will print the
        additional line '(DESQview detected)'.

        In verbose mode, CRON will then print information about the first
        command to execute, and start its real-time second countdown.

        If this information looks funny (displaying left arrows and '['
        characters) you don't have an ANSI driver resident. Put the line

          DEVICE=[drive:\path\]ANSI.SYS

        in your CONFIG.SYS file, or load DVANSI.COM before starting CRON if
        running under DESQview.

        4 THE CRONTAB IN DETAIL



        4.1 Syntax Summary

        CRONTAB is a regular ASCII text file that can be created by any editor
        or word processor in non-document mode.

        Lines containing a '#' character in column 1, and blank lines, are
        ignored (useful for commenting crontabs).

        All other lines are interpreted as CRONTAB ENTRIES. A CRONTAB entry has
        the following format:

        minute   hour   day   month   day-of-week   command

        Fields are separated by any number of tabs or spaces. No tabs or spaces
        are allowed inside the first 5 fields. Maximum line length is 512
        characters including the trailing CR/LF pair.



        4.2 The Date and Time fields

        These fields can have the following forms:

          *         all legal values
          i,j,k     sequence of values
          i-j       inclusive range of values

        The sequence and range forms may be combined, as in

          1,3,5,7-9,11,13-17,19

        An asterisk '*' overrides any other value in a field. Thus

          1,3,*,5,7

        is equivalent to

          *

        Legal ranges for the different fields are as follows:

          minute         -- 0..59
          hour           -- 0..23 (24-hour clock)
          day            -- 1..31 (must be consistent with month)
          month          -- 1..12
          day-of-week    -- 0..6, 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday etc.


        CRON detects values that are out of range, and impossible dates (like
        February 31.).


        CRON User's Guide            Rev. 01-15-92        (C) 1992 Tron Hvaring




        CRON User's Guide            Rev. 01-15-92                       Page 9



        The actual execution times computed by CRON is the largest matching set
        of times. This is best explained by the following example:

          54 6 1,15 * 1 doreport

        means that the command 'doreport' will be executed at 06:54 on the 1.
        and 15. of every month (month = '*'), AND on each monday (day-of-week =
        1). If the 1. or 15. falls on a Monday, 'doreport' will not be executed
        twice.

        The extremes in terms of periodicity are:

        * * * * * dooften     -- executes 'dooften' every minute
        1 0 1 1 * calendar    -- executes 'calendar' at 00:01 each January 1.



        4.3 The Command Field

        The 'command' field of a CRONTAB entry consists of one or more COMMAND
        LINES, separated by semicolons ';'. If the command field contains only
        one command line, it should not be terminated by a semicolon.

        A COMMAND LINE obeys the following syntax:

          [~][!]DOS command line

        i.e. an optional '~' character, followed by an optional '!' character,
        followed by a regular DOS command line.

        Thus a command field looks like

          [~][!]command line;[~][!]command line;[~][!]command line....

        or

          [~][!]command line


        The '~' character means 'NOSWAP'. It means that CRON should not swap
        itself out when executing this command, even if swapping is enabled. If
        swapping is disabled, the character is ignored. This feature is useful
        for small commands that require modest amounts of memory.

        If both '~' and '!' are entered, '~' must precede '!'.

        CRON User's Guide            Rev. 01-15-92                      Page 10


        IMPORTANT NOTE:
        ---------------

        if any 'command line' contains path separator characters (i.e. '\'
        inside pathnames) each '\' must be entered TWICE. This is because
        starting with V1.6, CRON assumes that '\' is an escape character,
        causing the next character to be processed literally (even if it is a
        '!', a '~' or a ';'). Thus

          cdd d:\mypath

        will not work as expected, whereas

          cdd d:\\mypath

        will.


        The '!' character is a synonym for %COMSPEC% /C, i.e. the contents of
        the environment variable COMSPEC, followed by the string " /C ".

        Thus the command lines

          !dir

        and

          COMMAND /C dir

        are equivalent, provided COMSPEC points to COMMAND.COM.

        '!' (or its synonym) is *required* for COMMAND.COM internal commands,
        like DIR, DEL and CD.

        '!' (or its synonym) is optional for executable programs, including
        .BAT files.

        If your command uses redirection (i.e. <, >, >> or |), '!' is required
        since redirection is handled by COMMAND.COM. Otherwise it should not be
        used, as it adds no functionality except consuming a few K of
        additional memory.

        Thus the command line

          sort <infile >outfile

        will not work as expected, but

          !sort <infile >outfile

        will.

        CRON User's Guide            Rev. 01-15-92                      Page 11


        Note that CRON knows about .BAT files and will spawn COMMAND.COM
        internally for them. Therefore, the '!' prefix is not needed for .BAT
        files.

        When locating the command to execute, CRON follows the standard DOS
        algorithm: first look in the current directory, then in each directory
        along the PATH, respecting the search order for .COM, .EXE and .BAT
        files. Thus CRONTAB command lines may be entered exactly as if you were
        at the DOS prompt, except for the '!' prefix (which is implicit when at
        the DOS command line).

        CRON sets the logged drive and directory to their startup values (i.e.
        the drive and directory that were current when CRON started) before
        executing a CRONTAB entry.


        If an entry contains multiple command lines, the logged drive and
        directory are not reset between command lines. This allows entries such
        as:

        57 5 1,15 * * ~!d:;~!cd \\acct\\dbase;misreport

        assuming that the program 'misreport' expects to be run from the
        'D:\ACCT\DBASE' directory.

        The enclosed file CRONTAB contains several commented CRONTAB entries.

        See chapter 9 for a description of the enclosed utilities that are
        useful in CRONTAB entries.

        5 THE CRONLOG IN DETAIL



        5.1 General Description

        The optional CRONLOG is a text file produced by CRON where all its
        operations and their results are logged.

        CRONLOG is a plain ASCII text file with highly structured lines.
        Cronlogs are suitable for automatic processing, for example with AWK or
        similar utilities.

        The cronlog is always opened in APPEND mode, so it is ever-increasing.
        The utility LOGCHECK.EXE (documented later) can be used to control the
        size of the cronlog.

        CRON produces a log entry when:

          -    CRON is started
          -    CRON is stopped
          -    CRON starts to execute a CRONTAB entry
          -    CRON has finished to execute a CRONTAB entry
          -    CRON starts to execute subsequent command lines in a multi-
               command entry
          -    CRON has finished to execute a command line in a multi-command
               entry.

        Entries have the following general format:

        <entry token> <operation> <date and time> <additional data>



        5.2 Starting And Stopping CRON

        These lines are as follows:

        !cron started at Fri Oct 19 13:22:35 1990
        !cron stopped at Fri Oct 19 13:22:51 1990

        No further comments should be necessary.

        CRON User's Guide            Rev. 01-15-92                      Page 13


        5.3 Start and Stop of CRONTAB Entry Processing

        When CRON starts executing a CRONTAB entry, it produces a log record
        starting with the character '>'.

        A typical entry is as follows:

        > 'mapmem -v' Fri Oct 19 13:43:00 1990

        meaning that the command field 'mapmem -v' started to execute on the
        indicated date and time.


        When the command returns, CRON produces a log entry starting with the
        '<' character, as follows:

        < 'mapmem -v' Fri Oct 19 13:43:00 1990, rc = 0

        meaning that the command 'mapmem -v' executed until the indicated date
        and time (in this example, for less than 1 second), and returned with
        an exit code 0 ('rc = 0').

        5.4 Logging Multi-Command Execution

        For CRONTAB entries containing multiple command lines, CRON produces a
        sequence of records bracketed by a '>' entry, marking the start of the
        entry as a whole, and a '<' entry, marking the end of the entry as a
        whole. Between these entries, a pair or '>>' (start of command) and
        '<<' (end of command) is produced for each command line in the entry,
        including the first.

        The text of the '>' and '<' entries contain the entire command field.
        The text of the '>>' and '<<' entries contain the individual command
        lines, *without* any '!' or '~' prefix. These prefixes appear in the
        bracketing lines, though.

        A sample sequence is shown below, corresponding to the CRONTAB entry

          54 16 * * * !d:;!cd \\cron;mapmem -v

        > '!d:;!cd \cron;mapmem -v' Fri Oct 19 16:54:00 1990
        >> 'd:' Fri Oct 19 16:54:00 1990
        << 'd:' Fri Oct 19 16:54:00 1990, rc = 0
        >> 'cd \cron' Fri Oct 19 16:54:00 1990
        << 'cd \cron' Fri Oct 19 16:54:00 1990, rc = 0
        >> 'mapmem -v' Fri Oct 19 16:54:00 1990
        << 'mapmem -v' Fri Oct 19 16:54:01 1990, rc = 0
        < '!d:;!cd \cron;mapmem -v' Fri Oct 19 16:54:01 1990, rc = 0

        Exit codes are only produced for '<' and '<<' entries. See the next
        chapter for a discussion of how to interpret these codes.

        Some '<' and '<<' entries may contain the string "*** FAILED ***". This
        means that an error occured. See the next chapter for an interpretation
        of such entries.

        In a bracket '<' line, the 'rc = n' field has the same value as the
        last sub-command that was executed.

        6 ERROR HANDLING



        6.1 General Considerations

        Errors may occur for several reasons:

          -    CRON does not have enough resources to run
          -    CRON may be unable to locate or spawn a command
          -    a critical error can hit CRON (logfile disk full, swap error)
          -    the spawned command can fail
          -    a critical error can hit a spawned command
          -    a spawned command may encounter an internal exception requiring
               user intervention (i.e. the command prompts for keyboard input).

        If a critical error occurs -- either inside CRON or in a spawned
        command -- you are simply out of luck, since the infamous 'Abort,
        Retry, Ignore' requires user intervention (i.e. keyboard input).

        I considered trapping critical errors within CRON, but decided against
        it. Since CRON is typically run on an unattended system, and since CRON
        cannot know whether or not a spawned command has put the system into an
        unstable state, we cannot be quite sure that a 'disk full' error really
        means that the disk is full. To prevent disaster we simply let the
        standard DOS error handling take over, suspending everything until a
        human can take over. This is also known as the 'better safe than sorry'
        strategy.

        CRON relies on the fact that a spawned command will eventually return.
        If the command decides it wants keyboard input, and no one is around,
        CRON will be suspended until someone comes around to hit the keyboard.
        The net effect of a critical error hitting a spawned command is the
        same.

        The bottom line is that you should make sure no critical errors will
        occur when leaving CRON in charge of an unattended system.
        Specifically, make sure that all required peripherals are online, that
        any addressed printers are online and have enough paper, et cetera, et
        cetera. Also, make sure that spawned commands are started in such a way
        that they won't ever require keyboard input.

        Perhaps one day I'll understand what is so critical about a printer
        being out of paper, and why that condition is handled in the same way
        as a hard disk CRC error. Or perhaps I won't.

        6.2 Failure to Spawn a Command

        CRON may fail trying to spawn a command. This is reflected by a log
        entry of the '<' or '<<' variety, with 'rc = -1'. If swapping is not
        enabled, an additional 'errno = n' is appended to the entry. See
        chapter 8 for interpretation of errno values.

        If swapping is enabled, 'rc = -1' always means that CRON could not
        locate the executable file. This may be caused by:

          -    you forgot to prefix a COMMAND.COM internal command with '!'
          -    the command does not exist in the current directory, nor in any
               directory in the current PATH.

        If a command name is given without an extension, CRON will try .COM,
        .EXE and .BAT exactly like COMMAND.COM does.

        If a '!' style command returns an exit code of -1, it means that the
        command interpreter itself failed to load. This is normally a serious
        condition, with possible causes:

          -    the command named by COMSPEC has disappeared or is no longer in
               the DOS PATH
          -    the COMSPEC environment variable has been corrupted
          -    the PATH environment variable has been corrupted

        If swapping is not enabled, 'errno' contains further information. If
        swapping is enabled, one of the three causes above apply.



        6.3 A Spawned Command Fails

        This is indicated by an exit code in the range 0..255. It means that
        CRON could spawn the command, and that the command itself returned a
        non-0 exit code when issuing the DOS TERMINATE call.

        CRON's actions depend on whether or not the current entry contains
        multiple commands.

        If the command was the only command in the CRONTAB entry, CRON simply
        records the exit code in the log (if enabled) and proceeds to schedule
        the next command. The philosophy behind this is that a failure in one
        crontab entry should not influence the operation of other, possible
        unrelated, crontab entries.

        If the command was part of a multi-command entry, CRON assumes that all
        commands in the entry are somewhat interdependent and therefore aborts
        execution of remaining commands in the entry, logging this fact if
        logging is enabled.

        The CDD.EXE utility (documented in a later chapter) is a more
        intelligent alternative to COMMAND.COM's builtin CHDIR command. The
        crontab entry

          38 04 * * * ~cdd d:\\acct\\dbase;misreport

        will first change the logged drive and directory to 'D:\ACCT\DBASE',
        without swapping CRON, and then execute the command 'misreport'.
        Since 'misreport' obviously wants to be run from this drive/directory,
        we had better not run it if the 'cdd' command fails. So, if cdd returns
        a non-0 exit code, 'misreport' is skipped and CRON proceeds to schedule
        the next entry after logging the failure.



        6.4 Other Internal CRON errors

        If a swap file error occurs, CRON will report an error code of 256 (rc
        = 256) for the appropriate '<' or '<<' entry and will disable swapping
        for all commands thereafter. This may cause failure of other commands
        that need so much memory that they cannot coexist with CRON in memory.

        Error codes starting from 768 and upwards are specific to the swapping
        interface to the EXEC function, and are documented later.



        6.5 Exit Codes and COMMAND.COM

        COMMAND.COM is too dumb to return the exit code of a command that it
        spawns, even with the /C switch.

        Thus, when CRON executes a '!' entry or a .BAT file, it will receive an
        exit code 0 provided COMMAND.COM itself could be spawned, but the exit
        code from the actual command is lost even if it was non-0.

        Thus the following crontab entry may give surprising results:

        12 7 * * * !z:;!cd \\absent;!XXXXXXXXXXXXX

        CRON will happily spawn all three commands, since spawning COMMAND.COM
        succeeds. COMMAND.COM will print something like 'Bad command or file
        name', but will still return an exit code of 0.

        Thus all three commands -- which failed -- show up with 'rc = 0' in the
        cronlog, since COMMAND.COM lies about the results.

        4DOS or some other more intelligent shell may handle this in a better
        way. For multi-command entries where changing drive and path is
        crucial, use the supplied CDD.EXE utility instead of "!d:;!cd \\path"
        constructs.

        7 ADVANCED TOPICS



        7.1 Resource Requirements

        CRON requires 46 KB of memory, plus up to 1K per 16 crontab entries.
        The number of crontab entries should be rounded up to the nearest
        multiple of 16. This is a worst-case estimate; most CRONTAB entries
        require less than 64 bytes.

        When swapping, CRON leaves 1.3K of itself -- plus the size of its
        environment -- in memory, swapping out the rest.

        When swapping to disk, CRON therefore needs (size of resident CRON -
        1.3K + pad to cluster boundary + directory overhead) bytes of disk
        space, typically less than 64K bytes.

        When swapping to EMS, CRON requires (size of resident CRON - 1.3K + pad
        to nearest 16K boundary) bytes, typically 3 pages = 48K bytes.

        For very large CRONTABS (several hundred entries) CRON may require 4
        EMS pages, i.e. 64K bytes.

        When swapping to disk, the swap file is closed before spawning. The
        spawned command thus has a full 20 handles available.

        When swapping to EMS, CRON uses 1 EMS handle which is kept across the
        EXEC call.

        CRON only needs EMS and disk space when a spawned command is actually
        executing. Between commands (i.e. when CRON is waiting for the next
        command to execute), no EMS or disk space is used.

        CRON hooks no interrupt vectors except those hooked by the run-time
        library, and does not use floating point.



        7.2 Using CRON with DESQview

        CRON works very well with DESQview. If you use DESQview, chances are
        that you have EMS in your system. If so, use the -s -e options to CRON
        for best results.

        CRON detects DESQview at startup. When executing its idle loop (i.e.
        waiting to execute the next command), CRON issues the 'give up time
        slice' DESQview API call. (In command line operation, CRON issues Int
        28H calls instead).







        CRON User's Guide            Rev. 01-15-92        (C) 1992 Tron Hvaring




        CRON User's Guide            Rev. 01-15-92                      Page 19


        CRON is generally well behaved: all output is via DOS, input is via
        BIOS keyboard calls. Does not use floating point, can (should!) run in
        the background, does not use serial lines, does not require a floppy
        disk.

        Note that CRON should not be swapped out by DESQview, because of its
        real-time nature. Having DESQview swap CRON would invalidate CRON's
        timing function.

        So, when designing a DESQview profile for CRON, you should think more
        about the programs you are spawning from CRON than about CRON itself.

        For example, if you spawn a telecommunications program (which is a
        natural for CRON), you should tell DESQview about which port it uses.
        Also, if a spawned program needs EMS memory, the amount should be ADDED
        to amount required by CRON if CRON is swapping to EMS.

        The previous subsection states the memory resources needed by CRON in
        its different operational modes. These should be added to whatever is
        required by spawned programs.

        See also section 7.5 for the DESQview specific version of CRON.



        7.3 CRON Technical Information

        CRON is written in C and assembler and compiled with Borland C++ 3.0
        (ANSI C compiler mode) and TASM 3.0.

        The Compact memory model is used, allowing an unlimited CRONTAB size
        subject to memory constraints. Because of the way Borland C sets up
        DGROUP, CRON actually uses LESS memory in the Compact model than in the
        Small model, for crontabs up to 2-300 entries.

        The CRON source code is around 2500 lines, including comments.

        CRON uses only documented DOS and BIOS calls. All EMS access is via
        interrupt 67H, using the approved methods to detect the presence of an
        EMS manager.



        7.4 Differences between CRON and UNIX cron

        There are two major differences between CRON and UNIX cron:

          -    UNIX cron runs in the background
          -    UNIX cron executes commands concurrently, while CRON executes
               commands sequentially.

        Under UNIX, two commands can be started by cron at the same time (well,
        almost). Under DOS, two commands scheduled to execute at the same time
        will execute one after the other, and the order of execution is random.

        CRON User's Guide            Rev. 01-15-92                      Page 20



        Since UNIX cron runs in the background, and concurrently with the
        commands it spawns, a spawned command can never suspend cron. As
        described above, this may well happen with CRON in some cases.

        The background nature of UNIX cron can be emulated to some extent by
        running CRON under DESQview. Concurrency it not possible, however.

        With CRON, a command can be delayed if the previous command executes
        for a long time, i.e. past the time that the next command was due to
        execute. All commands will be executed, though. UNIX cron always starts
        commands at the scheduled times.

        Some of the more esoteric fields of the UNIX cronlog have been skipped,
        such as PID's of commands.

        The UNIX 'crontab' utility is of limited use under DOS and is not
        implemented.

        The LOGCHECK.EXE utility performs about the same actions as the UNIX
        /etc/logchecker shell script.

        UNIX cron reads all files in the /usr/spool/cron/crontabs directory as
        crontabs when it starts up -- this is the central repository of all
        user's crontabs. Since DOS's multiuser capability is somewhat limited,
        this feature was not deemed necessary. Also, hard-coded directory names
        and excessive use of environment variables are not popular in DOS
        circles.

        UNIX cron writes its logfile in the /usr/lib/cron directory. CRON's
        logfile is defined by the CRONLOG environment variable.

        UNIX cron re-reads its crontabs at run time if a crontab is modified by
        the 'crontab' utility.

        With CRON, you stop CRON, modify the crontab and restart CRON to
        achieve the same effect.

        The command-line options to CRON are not available nor useful under
        UNIX.

        The '~' and '!' command prefixes are specific to CRON and are not
        available (nor meaningful) with UNIX cron.

        7.5 CRONDV.EXE



        7.5.1 What Is CRONDV.EXE?

        CRONDV.EXE is new with version 1.6 of CRON. It can only be used with
        DESQview. The CRONTAB used with CRONDV.EXE should only contain two-
        letter commands, optionally prefixed with a drive:\\path\\,
        corresponding to the two letters used to start a program from the
        DESQview menu.



        7.5.2 How it Works

        CRONDV will use the DESQview API to spawn the corresponding programs
        asynchronously. The advantages are:

          -    CRONDV may run in a minimal (~ 40 K) window, since it doesn't
               spawn other processes in its own window
          -    for multiple-command CRONTAB entries, the commands will start
               simultaneously and run in parallel (in the DESQview sense)
          -    the xx-PIF.DVP files may be modified without the need to modify
               the CRONTAB

        The disadvantages are:

          -    CRONDV can *only* run xx-PIF.DVP files, *not* regular programs
          -    since CRONDV uses the "Sleep" API call, the real-time display is
               not available
          -    the CRONLOG will not (in fact, cannot) show return conditions of
               the spawned programs, since CRONDV doesn't wait for their return



        7.5.3 The CRONPIF Environment Variable

        CRONDV looks for an additional environment variable called CRONPIF. If
        present, any non-prefixed two-letter command is assumed to refer to an
        xx-PIF.DVP file in the directory named by CRONPIF. If CRONPIF is not
        set, CRONDV assumes C:\DV by default. For example, suppose you have

          SET CRONPIF=D:\MYPIFS

        then the CRONTAB entry

        23 17 * * * RE

        will make CRONDV try to execute D:\MYPIFS\RE-PIF.DVP at 17:23 daily,
        just as if you had entered RE under the Open Window option on the
        DESQview menu.

        CRON User's Guide            Rev. 01-15-92                      Page 22


        On the other hand, the CRONTAB entry

        23 17 * * * d:\\specials\\re

        will execute D:\SPECIALS\RE-PIF.DVP regardless of the contents of
        CRONPIF.



        7.5.4 CRONLOG entries

        CRONDV only produces the '>' and '>>' flavours of CRONLOG entries,
        since it is not possible for CRONDV to detect when commands terminate.



        7.5.5 About Programs spawned by CRONDV

        CRONDV runs programs as if they were started by the two-letter
        sequences of the DESQview menu. This means that CRONDV does not control
        whether or not the programs close their window on exit. The
        xx-PIF.DVP's used with CRONDV should be set up with unattended
        execution in mind, so that you don't end up with lots of windows
        waiting for EXIT to be typed.

        CRONDV cannot control nor detect whether or not the programs could be
        started. Lack of memory, resource conflicts (e.g. two comm programs
        trying to use the same modem simultaneously) etc. goes undetected and
        unreported. It is your responsibility to make sure that these things do
        not cause trouble.


        7.5.6 Command-line Options

        CRONDV supports the following subset of the CRON command-line options:

          -c tab         -- CRONTAB override
          -n             -- no logfile
          -l             -- logfile locking for network logfiles
          -L             -- unconditional logfile locking
          -v             -- limited verbose mode

        See the corresponding section for CRON.EXE for further details.

        The -v option will make CRONDV print the name of the PIF file and the
        time of execution of the command each time CRONDV starts to wait for
        the next command to execute. There is no real-time display, so
        DVANSI.COM is not required.

        8 REFERENCE SECTION



        8.1 Error Messages

        CRON can complain about various things, at startup and later. All error
        output is sent to stdout (i.e. DOS handle 2). Any startup error, and
        some other errors, make CRON terminate.

        The following list describes the errors (in no particular order):


        cdd("dirname") failed
               CRON failed to do an internal drive/directory change. Usually
               means disk failure, or a spawned command has wreaked havoc in
               your system. This error can occur after each spawned command.


        No memory for crontab
               CRON failed to allocate dynamic memory for loading the crontab.
               This means that your crontab is *very* large or that you have
               very little memory in your system.


        'command' : illegal date
               The crontab entry containing 'command' specifies an illegal
               date, for example February 31. Correct the crontab entry.


        Syntax: 'entry'
               The crontab line containing 'entry' does not conform to crontab
               entry syntax rules. Correct the offending line.


        CRONTAB is empty
               No entries were found in crontab.


        'file': cannot open
               CRON could not open the named file. File probably does not
               exist.


        'name': not a directory
               The specified 'name' is not a directory (swap mode).

               The environment variable CRONLOG contains a name that is not a
               fully qualified filename.


        'CRONLOG=name' : cannot open
               CRON was unable to open the file named by the CRONLOG
               environment variable. Either the file exists and is read-only,
               or the name specifies a directory, or the network denied create
               or write access to the file.


        (DESQview detected)
               Not an error message, but a startup message stating that CRON
               believes that it is running under DESQview.


        DESQview not found
               CRONDV was started outside DESQview


        '[d:\path\]xx-PIF.DVP' : not found
               CRONDV did not find the specified .DVP file.

        Lock failure @ <timestamp>
               A lock() call on the logfile failed, either because locking is
               not supported and you used the -L option, or because the call
               timed out. CRON[dv] continues to run, but switches off logging
               and verbose mode, so that the message remains on the screen.



        8.2 Exit Codes

        Some exit codes (shown in the cronlog as 'rc = nn') have slightly
        different interpretations when running CRON in swap or non-swap mode.



        8.2.1 Common Exit Codes

        All exit codes in the range 0..255 are actual exit codes from spawned
        commands. Their interpretation is specific to each actual command. CRON
        does not attempt to interpret these codes except that in a multi-
        command entry, the remaining commands in the entry will be skipped if a
        command returns a non-0 exit code, as explained earlier.

        8.2.2 Swap Mode

        In swap mode, interpret exit codes as follows:

          -1        named command not found. Either the command is actually
                    non-existent, or you forgot to prefix a COMMAND.COM
                    internal command with '!'

          0..255    see 8.2.1

          256       swap file error. CRON switches swapping off permanently and
                    continues execution.

          770       DOS EXEC: file not found
          771       DOS EXEC: path not found
          772       DOS EXEC: too many open files
          773       DOS EXEC: access denied
          776       DOS EXEC: not enough memory to load command
          778       DOS EXEC: environment is corrupt
          779       DOS EXEC: bad format for .EXE file (.EXE file is corrupt)



        8.2.3 Non-Swap Mode

        In non-swap mode, interpret exit codes as follows:

          -1        spawn failure, errno gives further information

          0..255    see 8.2.1

        For -1, errno can take one of the following values:

           2        ENOENT:  path or file not found
           8        ENOMEM:  not enough memory to spawn command
          19        EINVAL:  illegal argument
          20        E2BIG:   argument list is too long
          21        ENOEXEC: .EXE file format error



        8.2.4 RC = -1 for '!' Commands

        If a command prefixed with '!' returns with 'rc = -1', it means that
        CRON was unable to spawn the command interpreter, i.e. the program
        named by the COMSPEC environment variable.

        This is a serious error. Some possible causes are:

          -    the COMSPEC environment variable has been corrupted
          -    the PATH has been corrupted
          -    the program named by COMSPEC (e.g. C:\COMMAND.COM) has
               disappeared. Look out for viruses.
          -    not enough memory to spawn command interpreter.

        9 UTILITY PROGRAMS



        9.1 CDD.EXE

        CDD (for "change drive and directory") is a smarter replacement for
        DOS's CHDIR (CD) command. Since CDD is an .EXE file, it will return an
        exit code != 0 if it was unable to switch drive and/or directory.

        USE: cdd [d:][\path]

        Exit codes:

          0    -- success
          1    -- could not switch drive
          2    -- could not change directory
          3    -- bad command line syntax

        CDD is small, so I recommend using the '~' command prefix when using
        CDD in crontabs.

        Typing "CDD ?" gives a command syntax reminder.



        9.2 LOGCHECK.EXE

        CRON usually produces large logfiles. To avoid excessive log sizes, put
        a call to LOGCHECK in your crontab, with a period depending on how much
        you use CRON and the execution frequency of your crontab entries.

        USE: logcheck [-s maxsize] [-L|-l]

        where 'maxsize' is the decimal number of kilobytes that you want your
        logfile not to exceed. If no 'maxsize' is entered, LOGCHECK assumes a
        value of 32. Use -L or -l if you want LOGCHECK to lock the logfile when
        it operates (similar to CRON's -L and -l options).

        If LOGCHECK finds that your current cronlog exceeds 'maxsize' it will
        perform the following actions:

          --   copy the current cronlog to a file with the same name but with
               extension 'old'. For example, if your cronlog is named
               'CRONLOG.CUR', its current contents will be copied to
               'CRONLOG.OLD'. If your cronlog is named 'CRONLOG.OLD', the copy
               will be named 'CRONLOG.OL2'. Any existing file with the modified
               name will be destroyed. The copy is made in the same directory
               as the cronlog.

          --   truncate the cronlog to 0 size, then add the following entry:
               '!logswap <timestamp>'.

        CRON User's Guide            Rev. 01-15-92                      Page 27


        The following crontab entry will check your network cronlog daily,
        making sure it doesn't become much larger than 64K:

        13 5 * * * ~logcheck -s 64 -l


        Exit codes from LOGCHECK:

          0    -- successful log swap
          1    -- no action (log smaller than maxsize)
          2    -- could not swap log (disk error, access denied)
          3    -- CRONLOG environment variable not found.
          4    -- bad command line syntax


        Typing "LOGCHECK ?" gives a command syntax reminder.

        Caveat: LOGCHECK can only check the log when it is activated. Thus
        between invocations, the log can grow to a size much larger than
        'maxsize' if there is a lot of CRON activity going on. Select LOGCHECK 
        periodicity according to your crontab.

        10  PROGRAM HISTORY



        Version     Date      Comments
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
        0.0 - 1.0   10-19-90  [Internal] Internal versions
        1.1         10-20-90  [Public] First public release
        1.2         10-21-90  [Internal] Benign bug fixed: in the absence of
                              the -L option, a file handle was needlessly kept
                              open permanently. Harmless, but wasteful. Also,
                              CRON.DOC stated that CRON would swap to the
                              current directory if no TMP variable and if no -d
                              option. This is wrong. CRON will swap to the
                              directory that was current when CRON started
                              under these conditions. LOGCHECK.EXE always
                              unlocked the logfile even if locking was not
                              specified.
        1.3         10-26-90  [Internal] Upgrade to T. Wagner's EXEC23 -- swap
                              file is now closed when spawning. Saves a file
                              handle.
        1.4         10-26-90  [Public] Added compile date to CRON's banner.
        1.5         01-15-91  [Internal] Added the character escape facility as
                              suggested by Julian Templeton.
        1.6         01-20-91  [Public] Now includes CRONDV.EXE, DESQview
                              specific version for spawning xx-PIF.DVP's. New
                              locking options, -l and -L, for finer control.
                              All .EXE's now have the same version number
                              (1.6).
        1.7         02-05-91  [Public] Upgrade to EXEC25.
        1.7.1       11-10-91  [Internal] Fixed bug in CRONDV.C: bad word order
                              for long variable.
        1.8         01-15-92  [Public] Some changes to the docs. Recompiled
                              with Borland C++ 3.0 and TASM 3.0.
