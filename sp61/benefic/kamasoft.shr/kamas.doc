
            ==== OVERVIEW OF KAMAS (KAMAS.DOC) ====

KAMAS is a member of a new genre of personal productivity software that
we often call Outline Processing.  We at KAMASOFT coined this term and
helped pioneer this new genre of software (our first Outline Processor
was released in 1984).  In the current Personal Computing revolution,
other terms are also used in the context of this new kind of software:
"Personal Information Managers" or "Knowledge Outliners" or even
"Knowledge Processors".

While earlier productivity software (like spreadsheet programs) dealt
primarily with numbers, the more recent tools enhance thinking and
organizing.  Outline Processors help you organize your ideas as you
create, develop, and express them through the written word.  As a
Knowledge Outliner, KAMAS helps you plan, organize, and retrieve the
knowledge you gather for specific projects or finished documents.

The benefit to you?  A boost to your thinking and your writing.  You can
harness the computer's power to help you brainstorm, plan, write, learn,
study, organize thoughts, classify data, analyze ideas, catalogue items,
track information, and make presentations.

Outline processors add a new dimension to processing text that most word
processors don't offer.  Word processors are oriented toward producing
formatted, printed documents; they are output-document oriented.
Outline processors, on the other hand, help you express your ideas in
text to begin with; they are input/author oriented.  Outline processors
allow you to tie together your creative ideas in a way that is
disciplined and structured, yet dynamic and flexible.  You can name a
piece of text and juggle it around based on its relationship to other
pieces of text.  Outline processors keep track of the structure embodied
in the text and let you manipulate the structure itself, separate from
the textual context.  They truly offer a new dimension to creating and
organizing text.  They are the natural next step from word processing,
and products like KAMAS integrate both Outline Processing and Word
Processing.

KAMAS lets you create and manipulate text outlines using the power of
your personal computer.  The outlines contain what can be thought of as
structured text, which is kept in special files called outline files.
Outline files are internally organized in a familiar outline form. KAMAS
lets you create and modify outline files and it lets you traverse and
modify the structured text within them.  KAMAS is aware of the outline
structure of your outlines and presents the structure to you through an
interactive full-screen outline editor.

KAMAS outline files can grow to 8 Megabytes each.  Huge collections of
text can be organized and managed by KAMAS because the number of outline
files that you can potentially manage at once is over 300.  Within KAMAS
outline files, the number of levels deep that the outline can go and the
number of titles per level are both limited only by the 8 Megabyte limit
on the size of an outline file.  Copying from from one outline to
another is easy.  Because the KAMAS Knowledge Access Method (KAM) is so
highly efficient, KAMAS can do all this while never using more than 200K
of your DOS 640K of memory.  Compare KAMAS with other outlining tools
and we think you'll agree that, considering breadth, depth, efficiency,
and price, KAMAS is top notch.


There are two major areas in which you control KAMAS:  the File Manager
and the Outline Editor.  These two areas are closely integrated.

The File Manager allows you to Prepare new Outlines and to Delete
existing ones.  In addition, it provides utilities to manage the
Outlines on your disks.

The Outline Editor lets you edit both the structure and the text content
of outlines.  This is the heart of KAMAS.  The Outline Editor provides a
rich variety of commands to Insert, Move, Copy, Delete, Show, Input,
Format, Output, Search, and Retrieve outlines.

In addition to all the commands for editing the outline structure, there
are two parts of the Outline Editor for editing the text content of your
outlines: the Title Editor and the Text Editor.

The Title Editor lets you edit the text in outline titles.  The Text
Editor lets you edit the optional portions of text (up to 32,680
characters each) that you can attach to each title in the outline.  Both
editors are interactive, full screen editors.

You can control KAMAS through the comprehensive menu system or through
fast key commands that are entered directly.  The F1 key always gives
help.  The F2 key starts the menu system and then backs out one menu
prompt at a time.  The ESC key cancels whatever command you have
started.


======================== Shareware KAMAS =============================

Help us distribute KAMAS by sharing copies of the unmodified Shareware
KAMAS disk with your associates.  Make them aware of the organizing
leverage that KAMAS Knowledge Outlining can provide.  If they create and
manage text in the course of their work, they will thank you for it.

As Shareware, this fully functional release of KAMAS is available for
trial use.  If you have tried KAMAS and are continuing to use it, won't
you please support the Shareware marketing concept by supporting its
developers?  You can support this unique and very convenient marketing
method by registering the software that you have sampled and are
continuing to use.  By registering with us, at ONLY $39 for KAMAS, you
will receive:

  (1) A DOS formatted diskette containing the latest registered version of
      KAMAS.

  (2) The KCUSTOM utility which will allow you to customize many different
      KAMAS defaults like: screen colors, printer drivers, 43-line mode on
      EGA/VGA video adaptors, multiple drive searching, file manager
      sorting, and more.

  (3) A comprehensive 264 page printed KAMAS User's Guide.


The Shareware version of KAMAS is a full-function version of KAMAS.
With its online KAMAS Shareware Guide and the DEMO outline, you can get
up to speed using KAMAS quickly and easily.

But to gain the fullest range of use from KAMAS (for example, in the
areas of printing, file conversion, configuring, and brainstorming)
we highly recommend that you register KAMAS and obtain the printed
KAMAS User's Guide.  We think Registration is very inexpensive and
well worth the cost.

          ===== KAMAS SHAREWARE POLICY AND LICENSE =====

KAMAS is now (starting with v. 2.4) being distributed under the Shareware
marketing method.  Shareware distribution gives user's a chance to try
software before buying it.  If you try a Shareware program and continue
using it, you are required by the license to register and pay the

Non-registered users of the Shareware release of KAMAS are granted a limited
use license to use that product on a trial basis, and to give others copies
of the Shareware releases of KAMAS for trial use provided that the Shareware
KAMAS software is distributed in UNMODIFIED form and for a copy/handling fee
not to exceed $6.  Any unregistered use other than trial use to determine if
KAMAS meets your needs is a violation of the license agreement and is
forbidden.  The Shareware release of KAMAS consists of ONLY the following
files:
    READ.ME            Notes on the Shareware release of KAMAS.
    KAMAS.DOC          Overview of KAMAS with License/Order Form.

If you obtained your copy of Shareware KAMAS from an online dialup
service--like GENIE, Compuserve, or any BBS--you should have obtained it

utilities, and a bound printed User's Guide.

The KAMAS license authorizes the registered, continued use of one copy of
KAMAS on one machine at a time by a single user.  If more than one person
uses the registered copy of KAMAS at the same time (on standalone,
networked or multi-user systems) additional copies must be registered for
each potential parallel user. For registration and licensing of more than
ten copies, contact KAMASOFT directly (at 503-649-3765) for details on our
