Hi.  I am the volunteer who is responsible for the ACM Gopher server.
There are also a number of other volunteers and ACM staff
who manage the information and structure of the different areas/forums.
We are dedicated to building a useful information system
for the association, and we are putting a lot of effort into it.
The information base has grown extensively over the past year.
It's a very exciting project for ACM.

It is a work-in-progress.  There are a number of projects that are being
concurrently developed, and I hope all of these services continue to evolve.

Suggestions are more than welcome.  I would like for everyone not to think
of these evolving network services as some mysterious ACM
entity, but more of a grass roots effort (like most of the other ACM
products and services).  My email is clore@acm.org.  Send suggestions
to me or to the ACM-NS helpdesk, helpdesk@acm.org.  Often I get
busy and can not reply right away.  However, I do read all my mail
in a timely manner.

Now, let me address the CACM problem.  CACM is available on the Net via
WAIS.  The CACM source is not currently maintained by the ACM Network
Services.  It is graciously being housed by Thinking Machines.
In addition, acm.org does not have a WAIS/Gopher gateway.  The ACM
Gopher has a link to another system which is running the gateway.
The other system running the gateway is the point of failure.
The plan is to move the CACM from Thinking Machines to an acm.org
system and run out own gateway.  Unfortunately, this will not happen
immediately.  So, in the meantime, I will find a new system into which
we may establish a working link.  The other WAIS links I have created
are, ofcourse, having the same problem.  Also, consider using a WAIS
client.

The host name for the ACM Gopher should be gopher.acm.org (just
acm.org does currently work).

The only other empty/problem menus I can think of are under ``Boards and
Committees.''  If you know of any others, let me know.  I try to
test everything.  However, often, I don't have time to do any exhaustive
tests, but most sections are well tested by various volunteers (and staff).

Here is a listing of the ACM-NS Information Directors each of which deserves
a thank you.

   ACM-NS Information Directors
   ____________________________

   Each ACM forum and information service is managed by an
   appropriate Information Director.  Maintaining accurate
   data in a forum or information base is the responsibility
   of the Information Director.  An Information Director is
   also responsible for collaborating with the ACM-NS
   Information Project leader, and other Information
   Directors, to develop new and appropriate forums and
   information services.  In addition, an Information Director
   may act as a liaison between his/her constituency and the
   ACM-NS.
