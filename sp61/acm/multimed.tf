Dear Multimedia Folks:

The quest for efficient processing and management of multimedia
data is leading to another stage of evolution in computer
technology affecting many computer science areas including
operating systems, database systems, programming languages,
communication and networking, hardware and computer human
interaction. Traditional computing principles cannot deal
efficiently with non-textual information such as images, video,
etc. Thus we need to provide a forum for practitioners and
researchers in industry and academia for the development of the
multimedia-related activities through the exchange of their
knowledge and experiences. The forum for this work was begun
almost two years ago with the formation of the Task Force on
Multimedia Computing at the IEEE Computer Society.

A Task Force (TF) is a temporary organization for initiating
technical activities. A Technical Committee (TC) is a formal
organization for further development of well-accepted activities of
greater importance. The "TF on Multimedia Computing" has been
converted into the "TC on Multimedia Computing" as of November
1993. Attached below is the organization of "TC on Multimedia
Computing." Anyone is free to participate in our TC. Your active
participation in the development of specific TC activities as a TC
member would be appreciated greatly. Please feel free to contact
me (ichikawa@huis.hiroshima-u.ac.jp) or Mike Christel
(mac@sei.cmu.edu), Secretary for TC on Multimedia Computing.

Sincerely,
Tadao Ichikawa, Chair for TC on Multimedia Computing
