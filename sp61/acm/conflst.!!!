Feel free to pass this info along to anyone who may have responsibilities
for conference organization and administration....I can't reach everyone
who might like to make use of this service.
Better than news.announce.conferences, IMHO, since those announcements can
scroll of the news spool.

Centralized location for conference announcements:

I'd like to make you  aware that the InterNIC (thru AT&T) is
offering FREE service in maintaining a database of conference
announcements.

HOW:
Make your submissions to conf@ds.internic.net with a
clear indicator of the date(s) and a contact person, and they will be
included verbatim.  There are no format requirements.

ACCESS:
The server is accessible via telnet (ds.internic.net login as WAIS
or guest); gopher (gopher clients use internic.net port 70; or
telnet to ds.internic.net and login as gopher); anon ftp; and WWW
(http://www.internic.net/)  In addition, a mailserver provides batch
access to the service. Send mail to mailserve@ds.internic.net and
include the command HELP in the body of the message.

The conf. announcements are accessible (via WWW)
at URL gopher://ds1.internic.net/11/pub/conf.announce which can be
searched by keyword.

GENERAL:
Directory and Database Services, provided by AT&T, includes a Directory of
Directories, containing lists of FTP (File Transfer Protocol) sites, lists
of various types of servers available on the Internet, lists of white and
yellow page directories, library catalogs and data archives. AT&T also
provides white and yellow pages type Directory Services. Access to these
services is initially provided through several currently popular in-use
interface methods while migrating to the use of X.500 technology, the
current standard specification for distributed information storage and
retrieval.

The database services which AT&T provides include the establishment of
Database Services to extend and supplement the resources of the NSFNET,
such as databases of contributed materials of common interest to the user
community.  AT&T also offers database design, management, and maintenance
to institutions and groups for inclusion in the Internet.

Detailed contact information for accessing Directory and Database Services
electronically is listed below. For general information about InterNIC
Directory and Database Services, call or write:

Phone: 908.668.6587
Fax:   908.668.3763
Mail:  admin@ds.internic.net

Other parts of the InterNIC are maintained by:
 Network Solutions provides REGISTRATION services (rs.internic.net)
General Atomics/CERFnet provides INFORMATION services. (is.internic.net)
