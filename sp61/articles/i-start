Subject: "Where to Start" for New Internet Users

A week or so ago, I posted to several lists a document called
"Where to Start" for New Internet Users.  This document is a
selected, annotated list of recommended books and other materials.
Since that posting I have received several comments and suggestions,
and I am now posting a newly revised version (below).  As always, further
comments and suggestions are welcome.

             "WHERE TO START" FOR NEW INTERNET USERS
                            Jim Milles
                             Ver. 2.0
                             12/16/93


1.  E-mail systems vary widely.  For help with most e-mail
    questions (signature files, quoting, and so on), contact your
    local computer support personnel or your Internet service
    provider.


2.  Some recommended books for new users of the Internet:

    LaQuey, Tracy.  _The Internet Companion: A Beginner's Guide
    to Global Networking_.  Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1992.
    (Read this first; the best guide for the true beginner,
    useful even for the pre-beginner who has not yet signed on to
    the Internet.)

    Hahn, Harley & Rick Stout.  _The Internet Complete
    Reference_.  Berkeley: Osborne McGraw-Hill, 1993.  (Widely
    considered the the best of the new crop of Internet books,
    and at 800+ pages, by far the most comprehensive.)

    Krol, Ed.  _The Whole Internet: User's Guide & Catalog_.
    Sebastapol, CA: O'Reilly & Associates, 1992.  (In the fast-
    moving world of the Internet, for most of 1993 this was the
    successor to _Zen_ as the essential guide to the Internet;
    has now been superseded somewhat by more up-to-date works
    such as _The Internet Complete Reference_.)

    Other useful books for new users:

    Aboba, Bernard.  _The Online User's Encyclopedia: Bulletin
    Boards and Beyond_.  Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1994. (A
    remarkably useful and comprehensive work, covering everything
    from the basics of computer communications, to using local
    bulletin boards, to the intricacies of the Internet.)

    Dern, Daniel P.  _The Internet Guide for New Users_.  New
    York: McGraw-Hill, 1994.  (Dern is the editor of _Internet
    World_ magazine and author of numerous articles on the
    Internet in many other publications.)

    Engst, Adam.  _Internet Starter Kit for Macintosh_.
    Indianapolis: Hayden Press, 1993.  (Highly recommended by Mac
    users, many of whom preferred this to the Fraase book listed
    below.  Includes a disk with a variety of Internet access
    software.)

    Fisher, Sharon.  _Riding the Internet Highway_.  Carmel,
    Indiana: New Riders Pub., 1993.

    Fraase, Michael.  _The Mac Internet Tour Guide: Cruising the
    Internet the Easy Way_.  Chapel Hill NC: Ventana Press, 1993.
    (The first Internet guide written for Macintosh users;
    includes a 800K disc containing useful software.)

    Gardner, James.  _A DOS User's Guide to the Internet_.
    Waterloo, ON, Canada: MKS [Mortice Kern Systems], 1993.

    Gilster, Paul.  _The Internet Navigator_.  New York: John
    Wiley, 1993.

    Kehoe, Brendan.  _Zen and the Art of the Internet: A
    Beginner's Guide_.  2nd ed.  Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-
    Hall, 1993.  (One of the first and most popular guides to the
    Internet.  The first edition was distributed for free on the
    Internet, and is still available at many anonymous ftp sites,
    e.g. nic.merit.edu, directory /introducing.the.internet,
    filename zen.txt.)

    Kochmer, Jonathan and NorthWestNet.  _The Internet Passport:
    NorthWestNet's Guide to Our World Online_.  4th ed.
    Bellevue, WA: NorthWestNet, 1993.  (A comprehensive guide to
    Internet resources, comparable to Krol's _The Whole Internet_
    but even broader in scope.  It covers a number of areas that
    other guides ignore.)

    Lambert, Steve & Walt Howe.  _Internet Basics_.  New York:
    Random House, 1993.  (Although this is a good, general guide
    to the Internet for any user, it is especially useful for
    those who access the Internet through the commercial Delphi
    information service.  Howe is the sysop of the Delphi
    Internet SIG)

    Levine, John R. and Carol Baroudi.  _The Internet for
    Dummies_.  San Mateo, California: IDG Books, 1993.  (A very
    useful, well organized, and readable book, one of the
    publisher's popular "... for Dummies" series.)

    Marine, April; Kirkpatric, Susan; Neou, Vivian; and Ward,
    Carol.  _Internet: Getting Started_.  Englewood Cliffs, NJ:
    PTR Prentice Hall, 1992.  (Includes useful information on how
    to obtain Internet access, as well as other technical
    reference material.)

    Quarterman, John S.  _The Matrix: Computer Networks and
    Conferencing Systems Worldwide_.  Bedford, MA: Digital Press,
    1990.  (A comprehensive guide to the history and present--as
    of 1990--state of the Internet and its component and related
    networks.  Recommended for those who want to learn the
    background and history of the Internet.)

    Smith, Richard and Mark Gibbs.  _Navigating the Internet_.
    Carmel, Indiana: SAMS Publishing, 1993.  (A highly readable
    guide, with an easy-to-use listing of Internet resources
    arranged by subject.  Smith is well known for his popular
    online "Navigating the Internet" courses.)

    Tennant, Roy, John Ober, & Anne G. Lipow.  _Crossing the
    Internet Threshold: An Instructional Handbook_.  Berkeley,
    CA: Library Solutions Press, 1993.  (Includes helpful fact
    sheets on various Internet tools from ftp and telnet to
    archie, gopher, WAIS, and World-Wide Web.)

    listserver systems.)
