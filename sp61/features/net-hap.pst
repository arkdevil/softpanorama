   ********************************************************** 
     SUMMARY OF ELECTRONIC PUBLIC INFORMATION NEWSLETTER
                  VOL. 3, NO. 22; November 19, 1993
   **********************************************************

INDEX:

1. PANEL FAVORS TRANSFER OF GPO TO EXECUTIVE BRANCH
2. ACE CALLS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK PROGRAM
3. OMB PUBLISHES DRAFT PROPOSAL FOR GILS
4. GPO DRAFTS PLAN FOR ELECTRONIC INFORMATION ACCESS
5. DIMARIO CONFIRMED AS PUBLIC PRINTER
6. NIIT DEMOSTRATES FIRST EARTH SCIENCE TESTBED APPLICATION


1. PANEL FAVORS TRANSFER OF GPO TO EXECUTIVE BRANCH: In a surprise
move, the Committee on House Administration drafted and approved an
amendment to pending legislation to move the Government Printing
Office from the legislative to the executive branch. At the same
time, the functions of information dissemination exercised by the
Government Printing Office would be transferred to the Library of
Congress. (However, at the last minute, the House Rules Committee
put the GPO back in the leglisative branch. The latter was then
passed by the House.) In a letter to Rep. John Moakley, Chairman of
the House Rules Committee, Rep. Charlie Rose, Chairman of the House
Administration Committee, and Rep. Bill Thomas, the Committee's
Ranking Minority Member, stated, "The Committee amendment
(substitute) preserves and enhances the traditional role of the
Congress as disseminator of government information to the public,
while allowing the executive branch maximum control over
publishing, and procurement of publishing, for the executive and
judicial branches of government." The Committee amended Title XIV,
"Reinventing Support Services," of the "Government Reform and
Savings Act of 1993" (H.R. 3400). H.R. 3400 is an administration
backed measure designed to implement the Gore Report on
"Reinventing Government," an attempt by the Clinton Administration
to reform the federal bureaucracy and at the same time cut $10
billion from the federal deficit. Part of that reform called for
the transfer of executive branch printing out of the GPO to the
individual federal agencies.

2. ACE CALLS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK PROGRAM:
Americans Communicating Electronically (ACE), an ad hoc group of
federal officials and others, called last week on the Clinton
Administration to develop a communications network program between
the federal government and the American public. To support the
development of interactive communications between governments and
communities, ACE recommended the issuance of an executive directive
assigning responsibility to all federal and agencies for the
establishment of information access programs to help create and
foster an "interactive citizen-government communications system."
At the same time, the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA)
released the report, "Making Government Work: Electronic Delivery
of Federal Services" [OTA-TCT-578, Sept. 1993], where it urged the
Clinton Administration to adopt an overall strategy or vision for
the electronic delivery of government services.

3. OMB PUBLISHES DRAFT PROPOSAL FOR GILS: A 12-page, revised, draft
of the conceptual design for an agency-based Government Information
Locator Service (GILS) was published (11/11) in the Federal
Register and Commerce Business Daily. The draft was prepared by
Eliot Christian of the U.S. Geological Survey, who is currently
working with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in concert
with the Information Policy Committee of the Information
Infrastructure Task Force (IITF) on the development of GILS. EPIN
reported on Christian's draft proposal in its Oct. 8 edition.
A public meeting to discuss the draft will be held December 13 in
the auditorium of the Department of Interior at 1849 C Street, N.W.
in Washington, D.C. Written comments can be sent to Barbara Banks,
information Policy Branch, Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs, OMB, Room 3235 New Executive Office Building, Washington,
D.C. 20503. OMB is requesting that the comments be sent by December
15. Comments can also be forwarded to OMB via electronic mail to
the following OMB x 400 mail address:
/s=3Dgils=3Dus/admd=3Dtelemail/prmd=3Dgov+eop. (Internet users add
=FE/@sprint.com=FE to the address. The document is available on
FedWorld or via FTP on Internet from 130.11.48.107 as /pub/gils.doc
(Microsoft Word for Windows format) or /pub/gils.txt (ASCII text
format).

4. GPO DRAFTS PLAN FOR ELECTRONIC INFORMATION ACCESS: By the
beginning of next year, the Government Printing Office (GPO) hopes
to have a prototype information locator service and Internet access
to the Congressional Record and Federal Register using a Wide Area
Information Server (WAIS). These goals are outlined in GPO's
"Initial Implementation Plan," which was prepared by the Office of
Electronic Information Dissemination Services for the purpose of
carrying out the mandate of the Government Printing Office
Electronic Information Access Enhancement Act of 1993 (GPO Access).
The GPO Access legislation requires the Superintendent of Documents
to 1) maintain an electronic directory (locator) of Federal
electronic information; 2) provide a system of online interactive
service providing access to the Congressional Record and Federal
Register and other appropriate publications, and 3) operate an
electronic storage facility for federal electronic information.
Collectively these three mandates are referred to as the GPO Access
System. Congress mandated that GPO have the system operational by
June 1994.
Note: a copy of the "Initial Implementation Plan" and the RFP for
the software can be downloaded free of charge from the GPO Federal
Bulletin Board under the SIG "GPOACCES."

5. DIMARIO CONFIRMED AS PUBLIC PRINTER: The Senate confirmed
Michael F. DiMario as Public Printer on November 9. DiMario
received strong support from the American Library Association and
the Government Printing Office unions, among others, at his
confirmation before a hearing of the Senate Rules Committee on
October 28.

6. NIIT DEMOSTRATES FIRST EARTH SCIENCE TESTBED APPLICATION: An
industry-led group of corporations, universities and government
agencies treated the press last week to a demonstration of a
network application showing the power and practicality of the
emerging information superhighway. The consortium, the National
Information Infrastructure Testbed, showed two computers=FElocated on
either coast but linked by a highspeed network=FEsimultaneously
sharing software and data. The demonstration showed that
information retrieved from a third location=FEa database in South
Dakota=FEcan  appear simultaneously on a computer terminal in Oregon
and another terminal a continent apart in New Hampshire. The
operators at each terminal can manipulate the data according to a
variety of common programs with the changes appearing at the same
time on both terminals. The demonstration took place at the Sprint
Applied Technology Center in Washington, D.C. and involved NIIT's
first network application, the Earth Data Systems.

Subject: Print Version of PACS Review Volume 3 Published

The Public-Access Computer Systems Review (PACS Review) is an
electronic journal about end-user computer systems in libraries.
It is distributed at no charge on BITNET, Internet, and other
computer networks.  The journal publishes papers on topics such
as campus-wide information systems, CD-ROM LANs, document
delivery systems, electronic publishing, expert systems,
hypermedia and multimedia systems, locally mounted databases,
network-based information resources and tools, and online
catalogs.  It is published by the University of Houston
Libraries.  A print version of the journal is published
annually by the Library and Information Technology
Association (LITA).
 
Volume three (1992) of The Public-Access Computer Systems Review
has just been published in book form (ISBN 0-8389-7700-6).
 
This volume has papers on campus-wide information systems and
tools, including the University of California at Berkeley's
Infocal Campus Information Service, HYTELNET, the LIBS Internet
Access Software, and nonbibliographic applications of Z39.50.  It
includes an in-depth investigation of the future of electronic
publishing, a paper on The Online Journal of Current Clinical
Trials, and a bibliography about electronic publishing on
networks.  It also contains papers on reshaping library services
and staffing to support emerging electronic information systems;
the Canadian Network for the Advancement of Research, Industry,
and Education; and search failures in information retrieval
systems.
 
The first two volumes of The Public-Access Computer Systems
Review are also available in book form from LITA.
 
Volume two has a special section about major network-based
electronic serials that includes papers by the editors and
publishers of EJournal, The Electronic Journal of Communication,
the Journal of the International Academy of Hospitality Research,
New Horizons in Adult Education, the Newsletter on Serials
Pricing Issues, Postmodern Culture, and PSYCOLOQUY (plus a guide
to the important LISTSERV software).  The volume also contains a
paper on machine-readable data files in libraries and a symposium
on networked information resources and scholarly communication.
 
Volume one has a special section on the SPIRES system, which
describes projects that use the system for locally mounted
databases and campus-wide information systems.  It contains a
symposium on staffing issues and public-access computer systems,
and it includes papers about Carnegie Mellon University's Library
Information System II, CD-ROM networks, text management software,
the University of Guelph's SearchMe system, and Z39.50.
 
All three volumes include columns by Walt Crawford and Martin
Halbert, plus book reviews.  Volume three introduced a new
columnist, Priscilla Caplan.  Topics covered include artificial
intelligence, the Common Command Language, copyright and digital
media, enhanced OPACs, help systems, hypermedia, Internet
resources, and USMARC format integration.

From: richard smith <rjs@lis.pitt.edu>

Here is a report on "Navigating The Internet: Let's Go Gopherin'"
that ended last week.  A total of 17,769 people participated in the
workshop.  That breaks the attendence of the last Navigating
workshop of 15,000+.

Thought this might be of interest.  Jim compiled the following
statistics from the listserv:

Number of subscribers: 17,769
Number or countries:       54
.com users:             1,251
.gov users:               680
.net users:               160
.org users:               424


In addition, this course was fed through a USENET News group, was
redistributed through locals bulletin boards and other distribution
mechanisms. So more than the above number of people participated in
the workshop.

Jim has been interviewed by "NEWSDAY" of NYC and a British juornal
interested in the workshop.

This workshop was unique in that not only were the students at a
distance--I traveled from Pittsburgh several times and had to send
out course materials from Cincinnati OH, Buffalo NY, and Slippery
Rock PA.  The teacher was at a distance also in this distance
education course.

An evaluation may be sent out to a sampling of the particapants for
input on improvements and outcome of the workshop.  (Any takers on
helping with this?)

A small number of responses were received at the end of the
workshop.  Most seemed positive.  Some suggestions such as giving
it more of a MAC flavor or other points of Gopher usage was
mentioned.  (I still do this on my old trusty IBM XT, black and
white, turn it on several times in order to get a prompt, and back
up every 10 minutes because it usually crashes somewhere along the
line.)

Which brings me to finances.  Any suggestion on where to find
funding for this project?  Maybe a shareware course?  Any sponsors
out there?  Hey I'm unemployed and mobile--international
suggestions are welcomed.  A nice two year residency in Europe,
Australia, or the Orient might do the trick.

Anyway Jim and I had fun and hope that the exercise helped some of
those number of people Navigate the Internet.

*** Baltimore Internet Users Group ***

You are cordially invited to attend the December meeting of the Baltimore,
Maryland Internet Users Group. We have a very interesting and informative
speaker who will address Project Seymour, an important initiative which
will utilize the Internet to bring you access to unparalleled levels of
information through access to Maryland libraries and other public information
resources.

When:   Thursday, December 16, 1993   2:30pm - 4:00pm

Where:  University of Maryland Baltimore County
        Catonsville, Maryland

Directions:     Take Interstate 95 to exit 47B. Exit and follow the signs
                towards Catonsville (rt 166)(not the airport), go one half mile
                to the UMBC exit.

                Park in parking lot 10 (visitors/metered) or lot 13.
                For a campus map and/or more specific parking information
                contact the individuals listed at the end of this message.

                Follow the "Internet" signs and walk to the University Center
                Ballroom Lounge (3rd floor University Center).

Featured Speaker:

Dr. Ronald L. Larsen
Associate Director for Information Technology
University of Maryland Libraries

      Ron Larsen is the Associate Director of Libraries for Information
Technology and is an Affiliate Associate Professor of Computer Science
at the University of Maryland at College Park.  In this position he is
responsible for managing the implementation and operation of a State-wide
integrated Library Information Management System (LIMS) for the
University of Maryland System.  Dr. Larsen holds a B.S. in Engineering
Sciences from Purdue University, an M.S. in Applied Physics from the
Catholic University of America, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the
University of Maryland at College Park.


           Internet Libraries, Seymour, ... and Points Beyond

      Networks are increasingly becoming enabling facilities rather than
supplementary resources in libraries' continuing efforts to meet the
information needs of their community.  Network access to traditional
print materials as well as direct electronic publication, while still
largely experimental, is unrelentingly changing the way patrons use
library resources.  Continuing growth in publication volume coupled with
price inflation render impossible any expectation of developing or
maintaining a comprehensive collection to meet all of the needs of the
libraries' patrons.  The ability of libraries to continue to satisfy the
legitimate needs of their community depends on their ability to provide
demand-based, location-independent, and time-independent access to
information resources from the patron's workstation.

      Seymour is being deployed in 1994 to provide unmetered access to
Maryland's libraries and public information resources.  Eventually, all
libraries in Maryland will be interconnected over this network, providing
heretofore unachievable levels of information and resource sharing.

      Dr. Larsen will describe the evolution of libraries as the Internet
has become increasingly ubiquitous, and their growing role in the network
environment.  The background, architecture, and future of Seymour will
then be discussed, with time allowed for discussion.

                  GPO ACCESS ACT IMPLEMENTATION PROCEEDS

The Superintendent of Documents has held two meetings to describe the
implementation of the Government Printing Office Electronic Information
Access Enhancement Act of 1993 (PL 103-40).  The first was held at GPO on
October 22 to consult with information companies, while a similar meeting
for depository librarians was conducted in Chicago at the Depository
Library Council meeting on November 2.

Under the GPO Access Act, the Superintendent of Documents is required to
(1) maintain an electronic directory of federal electronic information; (2)
provide a system of online access to the Congressional Record, the Federal
Register and other appropriate publications; and (3) operate an electronic
storage facility for federal electronic information.  Work has begun on all
three components of the legislation.

For example, GPO's prototype locator should be operational by June 1994.
The implementation will use a phased approach, and the initial set of
information will be available by January 1994, with additional agencies or
information sources being added gradually thereafter.  The result will not
be a single, central locator, but rather a series of inter-related,
individual locators in several different locations.  According to GPO, the
prototype locator will:

*    allow federal depository libraries and members of the public access to
     an electronic Locator Service in order to obtain data on selected
     federal information services and products as well as to facilitate
     access to the referenced information.

*    provide a basis for the collection of data on user characteristics and
     needs, as well as tracking Prototype Locator usage.

*    demonstrate the feasibility of integrating the Prototype Locator with
     the other components of the GPO Access System, particularly the Online
     Interactive System.

GPO has set up a free Special Interest Group (SIG) on the Federal Bulletin
Board to announce continuing developments under the GPO Access legislation.
The SIG is named GPOACCES.  You can also use the electronic mail service
(E-mail) to send comments by addressing a message to GPOACCES.  To access
The Federal Bulletin Board, contact the GPO Office of Electronic
Information Dissemination Services (EIDS) by telephone at (202) 512-1265 or
by Fax at (202) 512-1262.

***************************************************************************

                      ELECTRONIC FOIA BILL INTRODUCED

On November 23, Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Hank Brown (R-CO)
introduced S. 1782, Electronic Freedom of Information Improvement Act of
1993 (see November 23 _Congressional Record_, pp. S17056-8).  Senator Leahy
said S. 1782 will give the public access to the records of federal agencies
maintained in electronic form, and takes steps to alleviate the endemic
delays in processing requests for government records.  Without specifically
naming the GPO Access Act, Senator Leahy referred to it in his introductory
statement:  "We recognized the importance of such electronic access when we
recently passed a law requiring that people have online access to important
Government publications, such as the Federal Register, the CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD, and other documents put out by the Government Printing Office."

***************************************************************************

            OMB PROPOSES GOVERNMENT INFORMATION LOCATOR SERVICE

The Office of Management and Budget is promoting the establishment of an
agency-based Government Information Locator Service (GILS).  In the
November 19 _Federal Register_, pp. 61109-10, OMB requested comments on a
draft design concept for the proposed GILS, and announced a public meeting
on the proposed GILS.  To receive a paper copy of the draft document, or to
request an opportunity to speak at the public meeting, contact Barbara
Banks, Information Policy Branch, Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs, OMB, Room 3235, New Executive Office Building, Washington DC
20503. Telephone: (202) 395-4814.

Comments on the draft design concept should be received by December 15,
1993, at the above address.  The public meeting will be held on December
13, 2 to 4 p.m., in the auditorium at the Department of Interior, 1849 C
Street, NW, Washington, DC.

In addition to paper copy, the draft design concept will be available on
the FedWorld bulletin board.  FedWorld can be accessed by using a modem to
dial 703/321-8020. For further instructions to access FedWorld, call
703/487-4608.  The document will also be available on the Internet via
anonymous File Transfer Protocol from 130.11.48.107 as /pub/gils.doc
(Microsoft Word for Windows format) or /pub/gils.txt (ASCII text format).
Electronic comments on the draft may be submitted via electronic mail to
the following OMB X.400 mail address:
/s=gils/c=us/admd=telemail/prmd=gov+eop. (Internet users should add
/@sprint.com at the end of the address.)

The OMB notice says that the public would be served by GILS directly or
through intermediaries.  Central disseminating agencies such as the
Government Printing Office and the National Technical Information Service
would act as intermediaries to GILS, as would public libraries and private
sector information services offering GILS contents through kiosks, 800
numbers, electronic mail, bulletin boards, FAX, and off-line media such as
floppy disks, CD-ROM, and printed works.  GILS would supplement, but not
necessarily supplant, other agency information dissemination mechanisms and
commercial information sources.

***************************************************************************

                 NCLIS CHAIR CONFIRMED; SEVERAL NOMINATED

Jeanne Hurley Simon was confirmed by the Senate on November 20 as a member
of the U.S. National Commission on Libraries and Information Science for a
term expiring July 19, 1997.  President Clinton subsequently designated her
as chair of the commission.

Simon is an attorney and served two terms as Representative in the Illinois
General Assembly.  She has also held positions as a legislative analyst and
government relations representative as well as consulting for a number of
organizations.  She currently directs the Emeritus Attorneys program of the
Emeritus Foundation by which retired lawyers volunteer their skills with
legal service agencies in need of professional pro-bono assistance.

Simon served on the Advisory Committee to the 1979 White House Conference
on Library and Information Services.  She is an ALA member who has
addressed several ALA Conferences; she was a keynote speaker at the Central
Illinois regional meeting of the Illinois Governor's Conference on Library
and Information Services in 1990.

She received her B.A. from Barat College in Lake Forest, Illinois, and her
J.D. degree from the Northwestern University Law School.  She is married to
Paul Simon, U.S. Senator from Illinois.

On November 22, the Senate received the following nominations to NCLIS from
the White House:  Martha B. Gould of Nevada and Gary N. Sudduth of
Minnesota for terms expiring July 19, 1997; and Frank J. Lucchino of
Pennsylvania and Bobby L. Roberts of Arkansas for terms expiring July 19,
1998.  There are still two NCLIS slots to be filled by the President.

***************************************************************************

            PRESIDENTIAL EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND MEMORANDA ISSUED

HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.  On November 1, President
Clinton signed Executive Order 12876, Historically Black Colleges and
Universities, "to advance the development of human potential, to strengthen
the capacity of historically Black colleges and universities to provide
quality education, to increase opportunities to participate in and benefit
from Federal programs...(see 58FR58735).  The Executive Order--among other
things--establishes in the Department of Education the President's Board of
Advisors on Historically Black Colleges and Universities, a Presidential
advisory committee; and directs federal agencies designated by the
Secretary of Education to enter into appropriate grants, contracts, or
cooperative agreements with historically Black colleges and universities.

INTERGOVERNMENTAL PARTNERSHIP.  Executive Order 12875, Enhancing the
Intergovernmental Partnership, was signed by President Clinton on October
26 (see 58FR58093-4).  The executive order is intended "to reduce the
imposition of unfunded mandates upon State, local, and tribal government;
to streamline the application process for and increase the availability of
waivers to State, local, and tribal governments; and to establish regular
and meaningful consultation and collaboration with State, local, and tribal
governments on Federal matters that significantly or uniquely affect their
communities...."

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE.  Pointing to the $200 billion the federal government
spends annually buying goods and services, on October 26 the President sent
heads of executive agencies and the President's Management Council a
memorandum on streamlining Procurement through electronic commerce (see
58FR58095-6).   The objectives of the electronic commerce initiative are
to: (a) exchange procurement information--such as solicitations, offers,
contracts, purchase orders, invoices, payments, and other contractual
documents--electronically between the private sector and the federal
government to the maximum extent practical; (b) provide businesses,
including small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned businesses, with
greater access to federal procurement opportunities; (c) ensure that
potential suppliers are provided simplified access to the federal
government's electronic commerce system; (d) employ nationally and
internationally recognized data formats that serve to broaden and ease the
electronic interchange of data; and (e) use agency and industry systems and
networks to enable the government and potential suppliers to exchange
information and access federal procurement data.

*5   CHILDREN ONLINE:  THE GOOD, BAD AND UGLY
     The explosion of on-line computer services, which mixes
children with adults, "holds hazards" for many young people
(Schwartz, WASH. POST).  And the intermingling of ages raises
questions of "parental supervision, moral education, free speech
and license," writes the paper.
     The POST:  "Dropping children in front of the computer is a
little like letting them cruise the mall for the afternoon."  The
difference is that parents often give children instructions
before they go off to the mall.  "We call it the IUD syndrome,"
said Jim Thomas, a U of Illinois sociology professor who studies
the computer underground.  "Parents are ignorant, technology is
ubiquitous, and some of the information is deleterious."
     Janice Abrahams, an Internet subscriber who is writing a
book about students online, figures there are about 150,000
Internet accounts for students, teachers and school
administrators in the 22 states she has surveyed.  She
anticipates 1.5 million accounts nationwide within 30 months.
And Abrahams notes that "kids connections" are the growth area.
Online collaboration is "one way that computers truly add value
to schooling," said Gary Watts, executive director of the
National Education Association's National Center for Innovation.
For example, the National Science Foundation and the National
Geographic Society unite online children from around the world to
meet and discuss school projects.
     But more opportunities exist at home for children to access
computer networks.  Besides sex, computer addiction is another
parental concern, explained Sherry Turkle of M.I.T. and an expert
on children and computing.  Turkle finds that most children
experience a period of time when they are addicted to the
computer, but eventually "develop a satisfying mastery and dial
back to normal use -- a pattern similar to young fans of chess
and other pursuits," writes the paper.  But to a few the lure of
virtual reality games such as Multi-User Dungeons may prove
overwhelming.  "Kids disappear into imaginary relationships all
the time ... but usually there's a limit to how far that
imaginary relationship can go, because it's all in their head.
[In an on-line game] those limits are taken off."
     Another worry is the risk of developing antisocial and even
criminal behavior, according to Mike Godwin, an attorney with the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based civil
liberties and policy group.  "We already face a large number of
young computer users who have no scruples about computer
intrusion, privacy violations, and other computer-related
misconduct."
     The POST:  "Despite their worries, few parents want their
children to miss out on the online revolution."  Educators and
parents are developing "innovative" ways to deal with online's
"more troubling aspects."  America Online offers Kids Only
OnLine, "a wholesome haven" with adult chaperons.  Others suggest
that teaching values is the best way to steer children away from
inappropriate use of online services.  For example, Mary Ellen
Verona, director of Montgomery County, Md.'s, Blair H.S. requires
both students and parents to sign a contract prior to children
setting foot into information highways.  The contract "outlines
responsibilities, purposes and limits of school computer use,"
writes the POST.  And student abusers face a stiff penalty --
they loser their online privileges.
     The "best way to keep children out of trouble might be to
scout out cyberspace with them," according to the POST.
Genevieve Kazdin, a "self-appointed crossing guard" on America
Online, points out that network has 45,000 subscribers and warns
parents:  "You wouldn't let your kid walk the street alone in a
city that large -- and you shouldn't here either."  (11/28)

>From the 11/93 issue of "New York Nonprofits" a publication of the
Nonprofit Coordinating Committee of New York:

STATE ON-LINE COMPUTER SERVICE

The Nonprofit Resource Center in cooperation with Empire Information
Service in Schenectady is finalizing plans to being CitizensNet, an
on-line computer service on state government which will be geared to
nonprofit groups across the state.  Plans call for interested
organizations to be trained to use the network this fall, and the network
to be inaugurated in January as the 1994 legislative session opens.
Participants will have access to all press releases and floor votes in
both houses of the legislature.  As part of the project, the Nonprofit
Resource Center is also negotiating with Legitech, a private company
which operates a computer program with bill texts, votes and other data,
to develop a limited version for CitizensNet subscribers.

To participate, organizations will need a computer with a modem and
telecommunications software, and there will be a $95 subscriber fee
annually.  There will also be a usage fee of $27 per hour.  For those who
haven't used computer networks before, information can be downloaded or
saved to a hard drive so time on the system can be minimized.

CitizensNet is meant to be an interactive computer network that will
allow advocates to spread information about their activities directly to
groups across the state.  There will also be an electronic mail function
that allows participants to communicate with other participants.  The
Nonprofit Resource Center is interesting in having advocacy groups load
onto the network the kind of analysis, alters and newsletters which they
are already publishing, and the Center will waive the $95 subscriber's
fee for those who agree to provide information to the network.  If you
are interested, you should call (518)438-4526.

Please post and distribute to interested colleagues.

                         Call for Workshop Proposals

       Developing an Effective and Equitable Information Infrastructure

    Directions and Implications of Advanced Computing (DIAC-94) Symposium
                           Cambridge, MA, USA
                           April 23 - 24, 1994

The National Information Infrastructure (NII) is being proposed as the next-
generation "information superhighway" for the 90's and beyond.  Academia,
libraries, government agencies, as well as media and telecommunication
companies are involved in the current development. Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility (CPSR) and other organizations believe that critical
issues regarding the use of the NII deserve increased public visibility and
participation and is using the DIAC Symposium to help address this concern.

The DIAC-94 symposium is a two-day symposium and will consist of
presentations on the first day and workshops on the second day.  The DIAC
Symposia are held biannually and DIAC-94 will be CPSR's fifth such
conference.  We encourage your participation both through attending and
through conducting a workshop. We are currently soliciting workshop
proposals. We suggest proposals on the following themes but any topic
relating to the symposium theme is welcome.

 Systems and Services              Policy
   + Community networks              + Funding
   + Information services            + Role of government
   + Delivery of social services     + Economic modelling of networks
   + Privacy (including medical)     + Commercialization of the NII
   + Educational support             + Universal access
   + Meeting diverse needs           + Freedom of expression and
                                        community standards

 Electronic Democracy              Directions and Implications
   + Access to information           + Ubiquitous computing
   + Electronic town meetings        + Global hypertext and multimedia
   + Threats to democracy            + Computing in the workplace
   + Economic and class disparities  + Computing and the environment

 International Issues              Traditional and Virtual Communities
   + Language differences            + MUDs
   + Cultural diversity              + Communication ethics, values, and styles
   + National and international      + Gender relations in cyberspace
       priorities
   + Cooperative projects            + Networking for indigenous peoples

Workshops will be an hour and half in length.  The proposal should include
title, presenter, purpose of workshop, references, and plan.  Workshops
should substantially involve the audience and proposals in which some group
product or action plan is created are preferred.  As the proposals may be
collected into a book, workshop proposals should be clear and informative to
people who don't participate in the workshop.  Proposals are due February 15,
1994 and acceptance and rejection notices will be sent by March 15, 1994.  To
discuss workshops or to submit proposals for workshops contact the program
chair, Doug Schuler, doug.schuler@cpsr.org.  Electronic submissions are
encouraged but paper versions are also acceptable (send them to CPSR/Seattle
- DIAC '94 Workshop Submission, P.O. Box 85481, Seattle, WA 98145-1481).

        Sponsored by Computer Professionals for Social Responsbility

Potential co-sponsors are being sought.  Please contact us if your
organization would like to help with this event.  For more information on
co-sponsorship or on general issues, contact conference chair, Coralee
Whitcomb, cwhitcomb@bentley.edu.

******************************************************************

With this message we cordially invite you all to participate in the
8th conference of the European Schools Project to be held in
Amsterdam.

Over the years the annual teacher meetings, as they took place in
a.o. Grossburgwedel, Copenhagen, Lenham, Toledo, Schwerte, were
appreciated by all teachers and other educators who could attend.
Although the participants of ESP are connected by telematics
throughout the year, the personal face-to-face contacts have proven
to provide for an extra very valuable element for designing
successful teletrips.

Therefore, although it is called a conference nowadays, its main
objectives is to be a educators' meeting, and to evaluate performed
teleprojects and to design new ones for the school year to come.
In addition many organisational and technological issues related
to the ESP, strategies to follow, and co-operation with other
international school networks will be discussed. A special point
of attention will be the involvement of more Dutch schools in ESP.

The agenda will reflect the different objectives of 1994's Amsterdam
conference.

Friday, March 18 will be devoted to ESP's organisational issues only.
Saturday, March 19, will be devoted to welcomes, more general issues,
like the various national situations, and special sessions on various
aspects of computer mediated communications.
Main themes of the remaining days will be the evaluation of
teleprojects performed in the schoolyear 1993-94, the designing
and planning of new projects, and plans and strategies for the next
year(s).

Of course, there will be plenty opportunities to exchange ideas,
information and demonstration of (new developed) materials and
equipment.

The official programme will end Tuesday evening March 22.

The conference will take place at two sites. We were fortunate
to be able to arrange a historic building along one of the
oldest canals of Amsterdam to confer during working hours.
In addition we'll use the conference rooms in the 'Park Lake Hotel'.
This hotel, situated alongside the river Gaasp, near the Gaasp lake
in one of the suburbs of Amsterdam, will be your residence during
the conference. The combination of these two places to stay will
offer you a first taste of the variety Amsterdam has to offer you.
Transport will be possible by Metro.
Estimated costs of the conference will be 550 Dutch guilders in total.
This amount is based on a four night stay in double rooms.
The amount includes hotel, all meals, and printed materials.
As soon as prices will be fixed we'll let you know.

With this call we would also like to invite you to contribute to
the conference. If you want to, please give a presentation on
your work or your experiences, or exhibit a poster. Although
we will try and be flexible enough to include your spontaneous
contribution on-the-spot, we would appreciate it to hear
from your plans in advance. So if you're interested to
contribute to the conference, please send (an abstract of)
your paper (with a maximum of 4 pages) before the December 15, 1993.
It is possible to send your contribution on disk, 3,5 inch, DOS, ASCII.
Also you can send it by electronic mail.
In this way we are able to include a written version of your
contribution in the Conference Report.

Please let us know as soon as possible if you are planning to come.
Deadline for registration will be Januar 15, 1994.
