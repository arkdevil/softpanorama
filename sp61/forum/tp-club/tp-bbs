> BBSkit is a BBS/door programmer's toolkit for Turbo Pascal 6.0 and
> newer.  It provides lots of features to make programming the door
> easier and lets you concentrate on the door instead of low level comm
> routines or file transfer protocols.  You can route input and output,
> support emulation including VT-100 and ANSI, send & receive using
> Xmodem, run a multi-node system, and more.  Also includes an extensive
> Util unit providing lots of procedures and functions useful to any
> program, not just a BBS or a door.
>
> Long description:
>         The time has finally come for the release of the much-awaited
> BBSkit 3.0.  This latest release offers a lot in comparison to older
> versions, with some new exciting features and lots of minor changes
> designed to make life more tolerable for aspiring BBS authors.
>
>         What's new in 3.0?
>
>           * Concurrent port support has been built into the COM
>             routines.  Now you can run more than 1 COM port at the same
>             time, and BBSkit will handle it without a problem.  Up to 8
>             concurrent ports are supported.
>
>           * The assembler routines are faster and more efficient,
>             providing error-free throughput up to 57,600 even on slow
>             16450 UARTs.
>
>           * Internal task switching courtesy of the MTASK toolkit by
>             Wayne Conrad allows BBSkit to do more than one thing at
>             once.  The internal routines have already been seeded with
>             task switch requests, which mean you don't need to do a lot
>             to get running in a hurry!
>
>           * Virtual consoles coupled with MTASK allow you to run more
>             than one TBBS object a single time, making it easy to run a
>             multi- node BBS on a single machine!  Each virtual console
>             keeps its own text screen, which you can switch between at
>             the touch of a key.
>
>           * There are all sorts of additions to the Util unit,
>             including an updated TTimer object for stopwatch timing, a
>             new countdown stopwatch (TCountdownTimer), a CPU detection
>             routine, country- aware Date and Time functions, and more!
>
>         Of course, BBSkit 3.0 still keeps all of the things that were
> included in version 2.0, including Xmodem and derivatives, Ymodem and
> Ymodem-G (registered version), BBSkit Session Protocol (registered
> version), emulation templates including ANSI and VT-100, fast async
> routines, and a complete manual to get you started.
