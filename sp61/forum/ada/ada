We are happy to announce that GW-Ada/Ed is now available free of charge,
for anonymous ftp, from wuarchive.wustl.edu. (see sample session below.)
This note describes GW-Ada/Ed and other Ada/Ed distributions, and gives
some general information about Ada.

The GW-Ada/Ed distribution contains the executables for GWAda, which consists
of the NYU Ada/Ed translator/interpreter system for DOS, together with 
an integrated editor developed by Prof. Arthur Vargas Lopes of the 
Pontifical University at Porto Alegre, Brazil. Lopes began his work on
GWAda while he was a doctoral student at The George Washington University.

GWAda is being distributed for exploratory purposes; the integrated
environment will eventually be made freely distributable, complete
with source code, and distributed under the GNU Public License. Please
understand that we are not yet providing source code because this system
is still in the developmental stage and we wish to avoid horrible
version-proliferation complications. Source code for Ada/Ed itself is
also available from wuarchive. (see sample session below.)

You may in any case distribute this software as you see fit, for
educational purposes and not for profit. Include this document if you
redistribute the software, and give full credit to its originators.
We'd appreciate your sending an e-mail note to mfeldman@seas.gwu.edu
when you start using the system; information on the number of users
will help us to obtain and maintain funding for this project.

GWAda is distributed as two self-extracting archives created by LHA. 
Each archive will fit on a 1.44 mb high-density 3.5" diskette.

When you un-archive the files (see the instructions below), you will find
a readme.nyu file with documentation on the NYU part of the system.
Note that you do not have to use the GWAda integrated environment,
but can execute the various parts of Ada/Ed from the DOS command line,
as described in the NYU instructions.

System Requirements

   IBM PC Compatible, 386 or 486, running MS-DOS or PC-DOS
   at least 3.6 mb available extended memory
   at least 5   mb free hard disk space

Ada/Ed

Ada/Ed is a full-language Ada compiler, developed several years ago
by New York University, and released under the GNU General Public License
in 1992. The compiler does not produce machine language, but rather a
file of instructions for a virtual machine. This virtual machine is
simulated by a program called adaexec. In a sense, then, part of Ada/Ed
is an interpreter, but most of it is a compiler in every sense. Ada/Ed
was validated (tested by a government-sponsored set of tests) several
years ago. Validation means that the behavior of the translator corresponds
to that specified in the Ada Language Reference Manual, ANSI/MIL-STD 1815-A.
Minor deviations due to the virtual machine  are listed in the documentation.

GWAda

GWada is an integrated development environment, a "shell", around Ada/Ed-DOS.
The editor structure will be familiar to DOS users of such compilers as
the Borland "Turbo" family. Programs can be compiled, linked, and executed
with a keystroke or two from within the editor, for example.

Additional Libraries

We are providing a few additional libraries for you to work with. One
is John Dalbey's Spider Graphics; the other is an adaptation of the
Portable Ada Math Library. These are set up in separate subdirectories.
A third subdirectory contains a lot of interesting Ada programs supplied
by NYU as part of their distribution.

Help with the Ada Language Reference Manual

Part of the GWAda environment is a help system that assists in searching
the Ada Language Reference Manual. This hypertext-like navigational
aid is accessed from the Help menu in GWAda. If you have a mouse driver
installed, you can use it to select topics.

More Information about Ada

The newsgroup comp.lang.ada is usually filled with interesting technical,
political, and economic discussions about Ada. Also, the Ada Joint Program
Office maintains an anonymous ftp server at ajpo.sei.cmu.edu. Many 
interesting documents are available there, including FAQ files, machine-
readable versions of the language standard and surrounding documents,
and the like. And you will find hundreds of megabytes of Ada source code
and other materials in the directory languages/ada at wuarchive.

Attached is a sample ftp session from wuarchive, to show you which files to
obtain for GW-Ada/Ed and other Ada/Ed distributions.

Enjoy!

There are two subdirectories under languages/ada/adaed. the gwu directory has
GW's enhanced Ada/Ed-DOS and the Jacques Rouillard (Marseille)
experimental Ada/Ed-Macintosh. The README's in those directories
give more details. The nyu directory has all of NYU's latest files,
including source and executables for the (unenhanced) DOS version,
and generic gcc sources for Unix. Have fun!
