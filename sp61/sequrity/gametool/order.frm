                      ==================================


        You may evaluate GAMETOOLS for a period not to exceed 30 days.
        If you continue to use GAMETOOLS after 30 days, you must register
        the product.

        Registering GAMETOOLS is easy and convenient. Registration
        includes several benefits. These benefits include:

                1.  An password to unpack GT3-R.ARJ

                2.  The registration serial number to register
                    the EMS version of GAMETOOLS.

                3.  Get an universial compressed EXE/COM decompressor
                    UP.EXE. It can unpack some extractable EXE.

                3.  Notification of upgrades.

                4.  1 year of free upgrades, from date of registration.

        You should notice that because there may be some bugs in
        GAMETOOLS that may make your computer misbehaviour. But if you
        find G3.EXE and G3X.EXE work well, you should register them
        after 30 days use.
