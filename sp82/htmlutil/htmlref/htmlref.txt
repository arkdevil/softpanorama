                       About the Program
                       -----------------

 HTMLRef runs under MSDOS or any environment capable of providing an
 MSDOS session.  The program will scan one or more HTML/HTM files and
 intelligently select lines with a URL of the HTTP: or FTP: variety,
 sending them to a designated output file.  It will additionally attempt
 to identify the URL in common language or, failing that, with the URL
 itself, and also send it to the output file.  The date of the reference
 creation and the original HTML file name is also supplied in the
 HTMLRef output line.  The output file is structured in such a way as to
 be viewed with a WWW browser.  The result is a compendium of URL's with
 descriptions obtained from the input HTML file(s).  The output file can
 be created as a new file or information can be appended by using the same
 output file name in different sessions.  All input/output processing is
 handled automatically, without user intervention.

 Here are examples of lines from an HTMLRef-created reference file, with
 comments following:

<H3> HTMLRef URL Referencer </H3><P>
   Comment:  this header is created for any new HTMLRef output file.

<BR><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/bp/bp.html">
[02/05/1995 - SUBMITUR.HTM] Washington Home Information</A>
   Comment:  example of an HTMLRef output line where a description was
             available from the input line.

<BR><a href="ftp://ftp.crl.com//ftp/users/ro/mikekell/ftp/htmlcon.zip">
[02/05/1995 - SATFTP.HTM] ftp://ftp.crl.com//ftp/htmlcon.zip</A>
   Comment:  example of an HTMLRef output line where an adequate
             description was not available and the URL was used.


                          Installation
                          ------------

HTMLRef may be installed in any directory.


                            Operation
                            ---------
HTMLRef can be invoked from the command line with arguments or without
arguments.  If used without arguments, HTMLRef will prompt for the
necessary input and output filenames.  Default filename extensions are
".HTM" if not specified by the user.

Examples:

   1.  Use the default "HTMLREF.HTM" output reference file to process an
   HTML file named "HOMEPAGE.HTM":  HTMLRef homepage

   2.  Use the default "HTMLREF.HTM" output reference file to process
   all HTML files beginning with "S": HTMLRef s*

   3.  Specify the name of an output reference file, using all HTM files
   in the directory:  HMTLRef *.htm myfile.htm

You may suppress certain output by using the following arguments on the
command line.  These arguments MUST be the last ones on the command line
and MUST NOT include any spaces:

        -d  Suppress the date information on output.
        -f  Suppress the input file name information.
        -s  Suppress the description information.

These arguments work cumulatively, so that using "-d-f" will suppress
BOTH the date and file name information.  Using "-d-f-s" will suppress
all information except the URL data (not useful for browsing!).


                           Program Notes
                           -------------

Note that the HTMLRef reference file can grow in size as you append new
input file information.  HTMLRef does not provide facilities for
eliminating duplicate URL references.  It is possible that certain URL
references will not be processed by HTMLRef is they are poorly
structured in the input HTML file.  HTMLRef makes every attempt to
extract the URL/description information if it is structured reasonably
in the input file.
