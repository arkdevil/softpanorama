
This is the public PGP key of Frans Veldman, developer of the TBAV utilities.

PGP is a high security freeware "public key" cryptographic application,
developed by Philip Zimmermann.

If you do NOT have PGP, you don't need this veldman.pgp file. If you do
not have PGP but want to obtain it, take a look at the major Bulletin
Board Systems. We do not distribute or sell it, nor do we give you
information where to get it.

When I used PGP, it generated two keys, the public one you will find
below, and another one which is private to me.  If you're wondering what
you can do with my public key, please read on.

-> Software ENcrypted with one key can only be DEcrypted with the other key.

This means, if you encrypt a file with my public key, I am the only one
who is able to decrypt it.  Now you can safely send me viruses!  If I
provide you an encrypted CRC of all our files, you are able to decrypt
and verify this CRC.  Nobody else is able to encrypt something that you
can decrypt with my public key.  If you are able to decrypt a file with
my public key, you may rest assured that the file originated from me.

By using PGP, you (the user) and I (the developer of TBAV) have a secure
method of communicating with each other.  No hacker can interfere, and
you are able to verify that the TBAV files are unmodified, free of
viruses, and originate from my system.  You can also send me viruses,
without the risk that the viruses may spread to the wrong people.

THERE IS ONE RESTRICTION! You need to be ABSOLUTELY SURE that the public
key, listed below, is mine.  Therefore, I strongly recommend that you
obtain this key DIRECTLY from me, or from a highly trusted source.
Since the key will never change, you may want to make just one phone
call to our Bulletin Board System - only once, for safety.  Once you
have a trusted key, you may download your TBAV upgrades from everywhere.
Just check them with my public key, if the key matches, you have the
original copy of TBAV.  Otherwise, you'd better get a more reliable
source...

Download or file request VELDMAN.PGP from our support system!
            2:282/222       + 31 - 591 382 011


What do you need to do? You need the PGP program, which is available on
many BBSs, including our Thunderbyte support BBS.  (F'req PGP)

Assuming that you have installed and configured PGP properly, use the
following command and answer the questions:
            PGP -KA VELDMAN.PGP

You need to do this only once. (There is no need to separate the key
listed below from this message).

If you want to send me an encrypted file, invoke the command below:
            PGP -E <FILENAME> "Frans Veldman"

PGP will create a file with the same name as the original file, but with
the extension '.PGP'.  You can safely send me that file, I'm the only
one who is able to decrypt it.

Note! If you want to send me viruses, I'd prefer that you use the
ESaSS company key (ESaSS.PGP) instead. That way other researchers
in our company are able to decipher the file as well.
