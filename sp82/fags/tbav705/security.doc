
This document enables PGP users to verify that the Anti-Vir.Dat file
supplied in the distribution archive of TBAV originates from us,
developers of TBAV, and has not been modified by somebody else.

For information about PGP read the file ESASS.PGP and/or download the
PGP package from our support BBS.

If PGP has been installed and configured properly, and after you have
added the ESASS.PGP public key, you can now verify the Anti-Vir.Dat
file. Enter:
    PGP SECURITY.DOC ANTI-VIR.DAT

You will see something like this:

> File has signature.  Public key is required to check signature.
>File 'security.$00' has signature, but with no text.
>Text is assumed to be in file 'anti-vir.dat'.

>Good signature from user "ESaSS B.V. <tbavtech@worldaccess.nl>".
>Signature made 1996/03/27 01:52 GMT using 1024-bit key, key ID 25ADBF1D
>
> Signature and text are separate.  No output file produced.

Note that the information displayed will probably differ from this
example. However, if the phrase "Good signature from user ESaSS B.V."
is displayed you can be sure the file originated from ESASS.

If the Anti-Vir.Dat file is verified, you can use this Anti-Vir.Dat file
to find out that the executable files in the archive are unmodified too:
    TbScan C:\TBAV AvFile=Anti-Vir.Dat
