<A NAME="Introduction">
<H2>Introduction</H2>
</A>
This is an alpha release of DosLynx for DOS compatible computers written by
Garrett Arch Blythe for The University of Kansas.<p>
DosLynx is a distributed hypertext browser with some World Wide Web
capabilities.<p>
This file provides information about installing, configuring, and using
DosLynx v0.8a.<p>
DosLynx is copyrighted by the University of Kansas and is free for
instructional and research educational use.  Non-educational use will be
licensed at a later date.<p>
DosLynx is available in its source and binary forms.<p>

<A NAME="SystemRequirements">
<H2>System Requirements</H2>
</A>
One of DosLynx's goals is to provide support for as many DOS users as
possible.  We have scaled DosLynx towards this end.<p>
The known system requirements are:
	<DL>
	<DT>CPU<DD>8086 compatible.
	<DT>Memory<DD>512 kilobytes free or more recommended.
	<DT>Hard Drive<DD>Required.  2 megabytes free or more recommended.
	<DT>Monitor<DD>Monochrome, Black and White, and Color supported.
	<DT>Graphics capability<DD>Optional.
	<DT>Mouse<DD>Optional.
	<DT>Network<DD>None, or Class 1 (ethernet) packet driver connected to
	    a TCP/IP network.  You may, of course, emulate a Class 1 packet driver
	    if you have the required software for your particular system (i.e.
	    PPP, ODI, SLIP, etc).
	</DL>

DosLynx is known not to work on the following systems:
	<DL>
	<DT>DOS<DD>Versions below 3.0 will not work properly.
	</DL>

Release 0.7a stated erroneously that computers using Lan Workplace for DOS
(or any other comparable TCP/IP stack) were not compatible with DosLynx.
See the <A HREF="#Installing">Installating DosLynx</A> section on how to
properly setup your computer when running an existing TCP/IP stack like Lan
Workplace but would like to use DosLynx.<p>

If your system is also not supportable, we would very much like to know your
system configuration.  Please mail the DosLynx developer at this Internet
address:<p>
<ADDRESS>lynx-help@ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu</ADDRESS>

<A NAME="GettingDosLynx">
<H2>Obtaining DosLynx</H2>
</A>
DosLynx v0.8a is available via binary anonymous FTP at ftp2.cc.ukans.edu in
the pub/WWW/DosLynx directory.  DosLynx version 0.8 alpha will be the file
named DLX0_8A.EXE which is a self-extracting archive.<p>
URL notation is
<A HREF="ftp://ftp2.cc.ukans.edu/pub/WWW/DosLynx/DLX0_8A.EXE">
ftp://ftp2.cc.ukans.edu/pub/WWW/DosLynx/DLX0_8A.EXE</A><p>
DosLynx will be updated periodically as new changes are made to the
application.  You will be able to find the new versions via binary anonymous
FTP to ftp2.cc.ukans.edu in the pub/WWW/DosLynx directory under an
appropriately named archive.<p>
URL notation for the directory is
<A HREF="ftp://ftp2.cc.ukans.edu/pub/WWW/DosLynx/">
ftp://ftp2.cc.ukans.edu/pub/WWW/DosLynx/</A><p>

<A NAME="RequiredFiles">
<H2>Required Files</H2>
</A>
DosLynx version 0.8 alpha has the following files shipped with it.  If you do
not have all of the files listed below we suggest obtaining a complete
release from the Internet address listed <A HREF="#GettingDosLynx">above</A>.
<p>
	<DL>
	<DT>DOSLYNX.EXE<DD>The DosLynx v0.8a executable.
	<DT>DOSLYNX.CFG<DD>The DosLynx v0.8a configuration file.
	<DT>README.HTM<DD>The HTML equivalent of this file.
	<DT>README.TXT<DD>The text equivalent of this file.
	<DT>ERROR.HTM<DD>The default DosLynx HTML error page.
	<DT>HOTLIST.HTM<DD>The default DosLynx HTML hotlist.
	</DL>

<A NAME="Installing">
<H2>Installing DosLynx</H2>
</A>
This section assumes that you have not already installed DosLynx version 0.8
alpha on your hard drive.  If you already have, you may
<A HREF="#Configuration">skip</A> this section.<p>
<A HREF="#GettingDosLynx">Obtain</A> a copy of DosLynx and place it in an
appropriately named directory on your hard drive.<p>
Enter the command "DLX0_8A" from your DOS prompt in the directory which you
placed the DosLynx v0.8a archive.<p>
The <A HREF="#RequiredFiles">required files</A> should be written by the
self-extracting archive into the directory.  You may now remove the
DLX0_8A.EXE from the directory if you wish by entering the command "del
DLX0_8A.EXE".<p>
For those users with a TCP/IP stack already loaded (such as Lan Workplace for
DOS) you will need to configure your computer so that you can unload the
TCP/IP stack at your convienience.  When you are ready to run DosLynx, you
must first unload your TCP/IP stack; for LWP, the command is "tcpip /u".
Next, if need be, load a packet driver emulator for your system configuration.
You should now be ready to run DosLynx.  After using DosLynx, you may want to
return your system to its previous configuration.  Do this by unloading the
packet driver emulator if one was loaded.  Load your TCP/IP stack again to
finish this process.<p>

<A NAME="Configuration">
<H2>Configuring DosLynx</H2>
</A>
Edit the DosLynx v0.8a configuration file named DOSLYNX.CFG with any text
editor.  Go through each keyword and provide the appropriate value.  Ample
configuration instructions are included in the distribution configuration
file.  Once finished, save the modifed file as ASCII text.  If you wish to
save your hotlist which was used in your old version of DosLynx, simply
change the hotlist keyword in the configuration file to point to your
old hotlist file.<p>

<A NAME="CommandLine">
<H2>Command Line Options</H2>
</A>
DosLynx has the following command line switches and options.  All command
line options supercede their configuration file equivalents.  All command
line options are case insensitive except for URLs.<p>
	<DL>
	<DT>/B<DD>This option will hide the clock, socket activity, free
	    free temporary disk space, free heap space, and message window
	    for the duration of the current DosLynx session.  This option
	    was added to not clutter the screen for blind users as this
	    causes some problems with screen readers, but makes for an
	    all around cleaner display for all users if you wish to use /B.
	<DT>/P<DD>This is the most important command line option.  If you will
	    be executing DosLynx from a directory other than the one you
	    installed DosLynx in, you must use the /P option.  /P specifies
	    the directory in which DosLynx may find its configuration file
	    DOSLYNX.CFG and the errorhtml file ERROR.HTM.  If you installed
	    DosLynx in the directory C:\DLX then you should use the /P option
	    as follows:<p>
	    doslynx /PC:\DLX<p>
	    To avoid having to retype the /P option every time you wish to
	    use DosLynx, create a DOS batch file automatically specifying
	    the /P option for you and place the batch file a directory
	    specified in your DOS PATH environment variable.
	<DT>/T<DD>This option specifies the temporary directory where DosLynx
	    will create its temporary files.  If you wanted to use the
	    directory C:\TEMP as the place to store temporary files, then you
	    would use /T in the following manner:<p>
	    doslynx /TC:\TEMP\<p>
	<DT>/L<DD>This option tells DosLynx how many loaded documents to keep
	    in memory before it starts releasing the oldest unviewed file.  If
	    you wanted DosLynx to keep the last 5 ready in memory, then you
	    would use the /L option in the follwing way:<p>
	    doslynx /L5<p>
	<DT>/V<DD>This option tells DosLynx what text mode to begin in.  /VLOW
	    tells DosLynx to use the 25 row text mode.  /VHIGH tells DosLynx
	    to attempt to use the 43 or 50 row text modes available to EGA and
	    VGA compatible video adapters.
	<DT>/H<DD>This option tells DosLynx if it should load the home page
	    you specified in the configuration file.  /HON tells DosLynx to
	    load the home page on startup.  /HOFF tells DosLynx to not load
	    the home page on startup.  /HOFF is automatically assumed if you
	    also use a URL on the command line unless /HON follows the command
	    line URL.
	<DT>/N<DD>This option tells DosLynx if it will allow network access.
	    To turn off network access, use /NNO.  To allow network access,
	    use /NYES.
	<DT>URL<DD>This command line option is actually any URL that you would
	    like DosLynx to load from the command line.  It can be any valid
	    URL or it can be a DOS path to a file.  Once a URL is specified on
	    the command line, your home page will not be loaded unless you
	    also append the /HON to your command line following the URL.  To
	    have DosLynx load this document on startup, execute one of the
	    following commands from the directory in which you installed
	    DosLynx:<p>
		doslynx readme.htm<p>
		doslynx file:///readme.htm<p>
	</DL>

<A NAME="UsingDosLynx">
<H2>Using DosLynx</H2>
</A>
DosLynx is a straightforward menu driven application.<p>
A user has several ways to activate the DosLynx menu; pressing F10, pressing
ALT and one of the highlighted menu letters, and by a single left button
mouse click.<p>
Following are a listing of all menu items and their functionality.
Menu titles and the appropriate menu choice are presented side by side with
the '|' character as a separator.<p>
	<DL>
	<DT>File|Open URL<DD>Allows you to enter a user specified URL.  Once
	    entered, DosLynx will attempt to load the URL.
	<DT>File|Open Local<DD>Allows you to select a local file from an
	    available DOS path.  DosLynx will convert the file name into
	    a URL and attempt to load the file.
	<DT>File|Close<DD>When this menu item is selected, DosLynx will close
	    the currently active window so that it is no longer viewable
	    on your display.
	<DT>File|Save Rendering<DD>When selected, DosLynx will prompt you
	    for a local file name in which to save the document in the currently
	    active window as ASCII text exactly as seen on your display.
	<DT>File|Print Rendering<DD>When selected, DosLynx will prompt you
	    for a DOS device to which to print the rendering.  The appropriate
	    DOS device to enter is the one to which your line printer is
	    connected, such as LPT1.
	<DT>File|Dos Shell<DD>DosLynx spawns your command interpreter so that
	    you may take action outside of DosLynx while it is still
	    running.  After selecting this item, you should always exit
	    the command interpreter and return to DosLynx after you are
	    finished.
	<DT>File|Exit<DD>This will cause the DosLynx application to exit
	    therefore ending your session inside DosLynx.
	<DT>Navigate|Find<DD>Allows you to enter a search string that
	    DosLynx will find in your currently active window.
	<DT>Navigate|Find Again<DD>DosLynx will again find the last
	    entered search string from the find command.
	<DT>Navigate|Next Anchor<DD>This will move you to the next selectable
	    anchor in the active window.
	<DT>Navigate|Previous Anchor<DD>This will move you to the previous
	    selectable anchor in the active window.
	<DT>Navigate|Activate Anchor<DD>This will cause DosLynx to attempt to
	    load the destination URL of the currently active anchor.
	<DT>Navigate|Prior Document<DD>This will cause DosLynx to attempt to
	    load the last visited URL in the currently active window.
	<DT>Navigate|Search Index<DD>Some loaded documents are searchable
	    indexes.  To cause DosLynx to search the index of the currently
	    active window, select this command.  This command will not
	    be active if the window contains no searchable index.
	<DT>Navigate|Show Destination URL<DD>Select this if you desire to
	    view the URL of the currently active anchor.
	<DT>Options|Toggle Low/High Text Mode<DD>Allows you to switch back
	    and forth between the default 25 line text mode and the 43 or
	    50 line text mode of EGA or VGA video adapters.
	<DT>Window|Messages<DD>This will cause the window containing all
	    DosLynx message to appear as the active window.
	<DT>Window|Clone Window<DD>Use this if you wish to create a duplicate
	    of the currently active window.  The window should be the
	    same in every respect except for window number and size.
	<DT>Window|Zoom<DD>Use this command to switch a window to its maximum
	    possible size and its previous size before Zoom.
	<DT>Window|Cascade<DD>Use this command to organize all open windows
	    in a cascading arrangement on your display.
	<DT>Window|Tile<DD>Use this command to organize all open windows
	    in a tiled arrangement on your display.
	<DT>Hotlist|View<DD>This command causes DosLynx to load the user
	    specified HotList file for easy access to anchors which you
	    speicify.
	<DT>Hotlist|Add current to Hotlist<DD>This command will add the URL
	    of the currently active window to your hotlist file and then
	    prompt you for a name by which to remember the URL.
	<DT>Hotlist|Home Page<DD>Use this command to open a new window with
	    the user specified home page loaded within.
	<DT>Help|About DosLynx<DD>Miscellaneous information regarding DosLynx.
	<DT>Help|Mail Developer<DD>Use this command to send a suggestion or
	    bug report to the developer of DosLynx if you are connected
	    to a network.
	</DL>

DosLynx also has many other ways of obtaining user input.<p>
All hotkey equivalents are listed beside the menu choices while running
DosLynx.<p>
In addition to the listed keys, you can use the UNIX vi keys (HJKL)
or your numeric keypad with your number lock on for anchor navigation.  This
differs from the 0.7a release of DosLynx that allowed the user to use the
Lynx arrow keys for anchor navigation which is no longer supported as the
arrow keys are reserved for scrolling only.<p>
Page up, page down, the arrow keys, and the space bar allow you to look
through a document that is longer than your display itself.  Further, if you
utilize a mouse with DosLynx, you can select an anchor by using a single left
button click, and activate an anchor by using a double left button click. A
special case arises when attempting to select an inline image which also is
has a destination; see the <A HREF="#SpecialNotes">Special Notes</A> section.<p>
Items contained in the status bar (the bottom line of your screen while
running DosLynx) correlate directly with items in the navigate menu which are
selectable by the mouse only.  In addition, the right mouse button is the
same as issuing the Window|Clone Window command.<p>


<A NAME="SpecialNotes">
<H2>Special Notes on Usage</H2>
</A>
As of the DosLynx v0.8a release, only the following URL types are supported:
<PRE>
	file
	ftp
	gopher
	http
	news
	wais
</PRE>
If you notice extremely poor system performace, such as the hard drive
being continually accessed, install a disk cache such as SMARTDRV.<p>
When attempting to select an inline image with a mouse, it may not work
as you expect.  Some inline images also have destinations, in which case
you will be taken to that destination.  Use the keyboard to specifically
select an inline image which also has a destination.<p>
For the best DosLynx performance, specify the temporary file directory in
your configuration file or on the command line to be a directory on a
RAMDRIVE.  See your DOS documentation for setting up a RAMDRIVE specific to
your system.<p>
DosLynx is a MDI (multiple document interface) application.  This may confuse
new users that are used to other World Wide Web clients.  As a rule of thumb,
when you open any URL or document through DosLynx's menu or equivalent
hotkeys, then it will exists in it's very own window.  Windows are numbered
in their upper right corner and you can switch between windows by pressing
the ALT key and the window number simultaneously.<p>
Each window represents an open file at any given time.  If you open more
windows than you have FILES specified in your CONFIG.SYS file then
DosLynx may crash.  Increase the number of open files your machine can have
if you plan to use multiple windows a lot.<p>
When DosLynx has used most of your computer's memory attempting to use the
File|Dos Shell command will not work.  Your computer simply does not have
enough memory to execute your command interpretor.<p>
When you ftp a file or activate an anchor that DosLynx cannot display as text,
you are asked to give a file name to save the information in; a filename is
now suggested by DosLynx.  These files are not removed by DosLynx when you
exit the application.  This allows you as the user to do what you will with
such files after exiting DosLynx.  If you are prompted to save a file that
is already on your hard drive (such as a local image) do not use the same
name in the same directory.  This option is being left in since some users
may wish to use DosLynx on a LAN and copy the selected files to their
workstation's hard drive.<p>
DosLynx has been known to crash when it encounters a file containing a large
number of selectable anchors in it.  This is due to an unavoidable memory
limitation.  Large files with few anchors will be loaded fine.  Future releases
of DosLynx will address this problem in a more stable manner.<p>
When DosLynx terminates unexpectedly, the temporary files it creates remain
in the temporary file directory you specified in the configuration file or
on the command line.  The temporary files follow the pattern of DLX*.$$$.
You will have to remove these files yourself if this occurs.  As DosLynx is
improved upon you can expect it to become a more stable application and
prevent you from having to worry about this temporary file problem.<p>
If you are wondering, the menu bar contains the current time in the upper
right had corner.  In the status bar are three numbers in the lower right
corner.  The numbers are from left to right the current network activity in
bytes, the size in bytes of the temporary drive you specified, and the
amount of available heap memory in bytes.  These were originally run-time
debugging tools for the developer of DosLynx but were left in as they are
harmless and give the user some information of what is currently
happening when DosLynx is at work.  They can be turned off with the /B
command line option.<p>
If your computer does not use a packet driver, which DosLynx requires, to
access the network, ask your local network administrator if there is a packet
emulator available for your particular workstation configuration.  For
instance, if your computer utilizes an ODI driver for network access, in order
to use DosLynx you will need to install the a packet driver emulator if one is
available to you.<p>
Once one program is utilizing your computer's packet driver, like DosLynx, no
other program may do so at the same time.  If you have need to run more than
one packet driver utilizing program at the same time, we suggest asking your
local network administrator if your computer can be configured to use a packet
multiplexor.  If so, you will need to find a suitable packet multiplexor
and install it on your computer.<p>
To correctly view the ISO Latin I characters supported by HTML, you must
configure DOS to use multilingual code page of 850.  Consult your DOS manuals
on how to specify the appropriate code page for your computer.<p>
To force DosLynx into a supported black and white video mode, type "mode BW80"
at your DOS prompt.  Consider doing this if you monitor is black and white
but DosLynx considers it a color monitor (monochrome EGA monitors).<p>
If you are interested in registering with the DosLynx development listserv
group, send a mail message to listserv@ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu.  Please do not
send subscribe requests to the doslynx-dev list directly.  In the body
