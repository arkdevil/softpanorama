<H1>Can I browse HTML files locally when I'm offline?</H1>

If you do not use Microsoft Windows, the answer is usually "no problem!"
Just use the "Open File" or equivalent option on the file menu of your web 
browser, instead of "Open Location" or "Open URL".

<em>Note:</em> for the most part, this is not a problem for
Windows 95 and Windows NT users. This section applies primarily
to Windows 3.1 users.

If you use Microsoft Windows, and particularly if you use Netscape, you
may have difficulty viewing local files when not connected to the net. 
Some web browsers will refuse to run unless there is
functioning Internet software running on the system. Netscape offers
a solution to this problem in the

release notes</a> to version 1.1 of their product. Essentially, you can
install an "empty" Internet interface (winsock.dll) that keeps
Netscape happy.
<p>
An easy way to do this for users of some Internet connectivity
software is to launch your Internet software but refrain
from dialing out. The details vary from one package of
Internet software to another. It is helpful to change
Autoload Home Page=yes to Autoload Home Page=no in your
netscape.ini file in the [Main] section.
