<H1>How can I put an access counter on my home page?</H1>

First of all, don't. It defeats caching proxy servers, putting more
load on your server. It forces your server to run an external program
for every page with a counter on it, putting more load on your
server. And it advertises your demographics or lack of them
to the world. 
<p>
<em>"Yeah, but I want to know how many people are accessing my page."</em>
<p>
Of course you do. Use one of the many
<a href="stats.htm">statistics tools</a> available to
analyze the access log of your web server. Even if you are not
the webmaster of your server, your admin will probably give you
read-only access to the log files.
<p>
Also check out <a href="http://erau.db.erau.edu/~tjd/log_faq.html">
Tim Drozinski's amazing FAQ on counting accesses without the
need for CGI programs</a> 
&lt;URL:http://erau.db.erau.edu/~tjd/log_faq.html&gt;. Most of the
techniques recommended there don't abuse the server, which
is a Good Thing.
<p>
<em>"I want an access counter anyway."</em>
<p>
In that case, in addition to Tim Drozinski's page above, consider the
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers/World_Wide_Web/Programming/Access_Counts/">
index of access counter software at Yahoo</a>
(URL is 
&lt;URL:http://www.yahoo.com/Computers/World_Wide_Web/Programming/Access_Counts/&gt; ).
Keep in mind that you must have CGI access at a minimum, and
server-side includes must also be turned on unless you are willing
to build your entire page with CGI or use a program that
generates the access count as an inline image. None of the above
approaches are efficient.
