<H1>How do I send newsgroup posts in HTML to my web client?</H1>
How to do this depends greatly on your system; if you have a Mac
or Windows system, the answer is completely different. But, as
food for thought, here is a simple shell script I use on my Unix
account to send posts from rn and related newsreaders to 
<A HREF="bunix.htm#lynx">Lynx</A>. Put this text in the file
"readwebpost" and use the "chmod" command to make it executable,
then put it somewhere in your path (such as your personal
bin directory):
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
echo \&lt;PRE\> > .article.html 
cat >> .article.html 
echo \&lt;/PRE\> >> .article.html 
lynx .article.html  &lt; /dev/tty
rm .article.html 
</PRE>
Then add the following line to your .rnmac file (create it if you
don't already have one):
<PRE>
W     |readwebpost %C
</PRE>
Now, when you press "W" while reading a post in rn, a message will be sent to 
Lynx, and the links enclosed in it will be live. 
<P>
Larry W. Virden provides the following version which invokes Mosaic
instead, and is also capable of communicating with an already-running
copy of Mosaic instead of launching another. (You can use the same
rn macro as above, invoking "goto-xm" instead of "readwebpost".)
Read the comments for details on the assumptions made by the script.

#! /bin/sh
# goto-xm, by Joseph T. Buck &lt;jbuck@eecs.berkeley.edu>
# Modified heavily by Larry W. Virden &lt;lvirden@cas.org>
# Script for use with newsreaders such as trn.  Piping the article
# through this command causes xmosaic to pop up, pointing to the
# article.  If an existing xmosaic (version 1.1 or later) exists,
# the USR1 method will be used to cause it to point to the correct
# article, otherwise a new one will be started.

# assumptions: ps command works as is on SunOS 4.1.x, may need changes
# on other platforms.

URL=`/bin/grep '^Message-ID:' | /bin/sed -e 's/.*&lt;/news:/' -e 's/>.*//'`
if [ "X$URL" = "X" ]; then
        echo "USAGE: $0 [goto] [once] &lt; USENET_msg" >&amp;2
        exit 1
fi

pid=`ps -xc | egrep '[Mm]osaic' | awk 'NR == 1 {print $1}'`
p=`which Mosaic`
gfile=/tmp/Mosaic.$pid

$p "$URL" &amp;

if      [ "$#" -gt 0 ] ; then
  if    [ "$1" = "goto" -o "$1" = "same" ] ; then
        shift
        echo "goto"   > $gfile
  else
        echo "newwin" > $gfile
  fi
else
        echo "newwin" > $gfile
fi
/bin/awk 'END { printf "'"$URL"'" }' &lt;/dev/null >> $gfile

trap "echo signal encountered" 30
kill -USR1 $pid

exit 0
