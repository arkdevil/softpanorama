<H1>How can I make transparent and interlaced GIFs? And what are they?</H1>
Transparent GIFs are useful because they appear to blend in smoothly
with the user's display, even if the user has set a background
color that differs from that the developer expected. They do this
by assigning one color to be transparent -- if the web browser
supports transparency, that color will be replaced by the browser's
background color, whatever it may be.
<P>
Interlaced GIFs appear first with poor resolution and then improve
in resolution until the entire image has arrived, as opposed to
arriving linearly from the top row to the bottom row. This is great
to get a quick idea of what the entire image will look like while
waiting for the rest. This doesn't do much for you if your web
browser doesn't support progressive display as the image is downloaded,
but non-progressive-display web browsers will still display
interlaced GIFs once they have arrived in their entirety.
<P>
You can make transparent and interlaced GIFs through the web without running
any utility software on your own system through the
<a href="http://www.vrl.com/Imaging/">Visioneering
image manipulation page</a> (URL is &lt;URL:http://www.vrl.com/Imaging/&gt;), 
which will access your image through the web and produce an enhanced 
version for you to save.
<p>
To create transparent and interlaced GIFs under Unix, check out
David Koblas' <A HREF="http://www.homepages.com/tools/">giftool</A>,
a program which can manipulate those options and many more
aspects of your GIF file.
<P>
For Windows PCs, try Lview Pro, version 1A or later,
available by anonymous FTP from oak.oakland.edu in
the directory SimTel/win3/graphics:
<P>
<code><A HREF="ftp://oak.oakland.edu/SimTel/win3/graphics">
&lt;URL:ftp://oak.oakland.edu/SimTel/win3/graphics&gt;</A></code>
<P>
As well as from many mirror sites.
<p>
You can also create transparent and interlaced GIFs using the
widely available NETPBM tools (an enhanced version of the older
pbmplus tools, which do <em>not</em> support these options).
The following Unix shell script, contributed
by Shane Castle, can make any GIF image transparent if
a recent version of the netpbm utilities has been installed:
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
if [ $# -lt 2 ]
then
    echo "Usage: transparize gifname color"
    echo "  gifname - name of GIF file"
    echo "  color   - color ID to make transparent"
    exit 1
fi
giftoppm $1 | ppmtogif -interlace -transparent $2 &gt; /tmp/$$.gif
if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
    mv /tmp/$$.gif $1
else
    rm /tmp/$$.gif
fi
</PRE>
Make the script executable using the chmod command. Usage
is as follows:
<PRE>
transparize &lt;image.gif&gt; &lt;transparent-color&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
In addition, there is a document explaining transparent GIFs available
at the URL <A HREF="http://melmac.corp.harris.com/transparent_images.html">
http://melmac.corp.harris.com/transparent_images.html </A>. You can
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/pub/net/www/tools/giftrans.c">
fetch the program 
giftrans</A> by anonymous ftp from ftp.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de at
the path /pub/net/www/tools/giftrans.c.
<P>
There is also a 
<A HREF="http://www.wg.omron.co.jp/~jfriedl/perl/#transgif">
Perl Script</A> (URL is: 
&lt;URL:http://www.wg.omron.co.jp/~jfriedl/perl/#transgif&gt; )
which makes transparent GIFs.
<P>
There are also five utilities for the Macintosh,
<A HREF="http://www.med.cornell.edu/~giles/projects.html#transparency">
Transparency</A> (
&lt;URL:http://www.med.cornell.edu/~giles/projects.html#transparency&gt;
</code>),
Graphic Converter (available from the "usual Macintosh
FTP sites", such as mac.archive.umich.edu; see the Macintosh newsgroups for 
general information on where to retrieve Macintosh software), 
Imagery (again, available from many Macintosh FTP sites), and
<A HREF="ftp://orathost.cfa.ilstu.edu/public/oratClasses/ART389.88Seminar/software">
clip2gif</A> (available by anonymous FTP from orathost.cfa.ilstu.edu
in the directory /public/oratClasses/ART389.88Seminar/software and from
many other sites including Info-Mac in the directory gst/grf).
<P>
A unique approach to the problem is offered
by <A HREF="http://www.minet.com/minet/imagizer.html">Imagizer</A>
(URL is &lt;URL:http://www.minet.com/minet/imagizer.html&gt; ),
which transforms your images on the fly when sending them to the user,
supporting thumbnails and TIFF-GIF conversion as well as interlacing.
(Of course, there is a tradeoff between storage space and CPU usage.)
