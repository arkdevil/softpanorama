<H1>Microsoft Windows browsers</H1>
<P>NOTE: Most of these browsers require that you have SLIP, PPP 
or other TCP/IP networking on your PC. The exceptions
are <A HREF="bwin.htm#slipknot">SlipKnot</A> and 
<A HREF="bwin.htm#icomm">I-COMM</A>, which 
have slightly more limited features but operate without a proper Internet
connection. SLIP or PPP can be accomplished 
over phone lines. You can do this one of two ways: using a
proper SLIP account, which requires the active cooperation of your 
network provider or educational institution (see
<A HREF="http://access.digex.net/~hecker/">Frank Hecker's
guide to SLIP and PPP access</a>; URL is &lt;URL:http://access.digex.net/~hecker/&gt; ), or by using 
<A HREF="fakeslip.htm">The Internet Adapter or SLiRP</A>, products
which simulate SLIP through your dialup Unix shell account. 
Another product, 
<A HREF="http://ugsparc0.eecg.utoronto.ca/~luk/Welcome.html">
TwinSock</A> at &lt;URL:http://ugsparc0.eecg.utoronto.ca/~luk/Welcome.html&gt;, 
provides equivalent functionality under Windows using its own proxy 
protocol. If you only have non-Unix based dialup shell access, or have no PC
at home, your best option at this time is to run 
<A HREF="bunix.htm#lynx">Lynx</A> on the VMS (or Unix, or...) system 
you call, or <A HREF="telnet.htm">telnet to a browser</A> if you cannot do so.

days by individuals.

can open many simultaneous connections in
different windows and display images and

only open two simultaneous connections, however.
<DT>
<A NAME="slipknot" HREF="http://www.interport.net/slipknot/slipknot.html">
SlipKnot</A>
<DD>
SlipKnot is a graphical WWW browser that operates
entirely without SLIP, PPP, an Ethernet connection, or
special server-side software
(but read the <A HREF="fakeslip.htm">SLIP emulator section</a> for another
workaround). SlipKnot features the ability to automatically retrieve
all documents linked to by the current document while the current
document is being read. SlipKnot supports multiple fonts, inline
images, forms, and review of documents you have already received
while new documents arrive. SlipKnot can also download "nearby"
documents in advance to save download time. Like I-COMM, SlipKnot operates 
entirely through a Unix shell account, not over TCP/IP. SlipKnot does
<strong>not</strong> require that you install any new
software on your Unix shell account. 
You can obtain SlipKnot by anonymous FTP from 
oak.oakland.edu in the directory 
<A HREF="ftp://oak.oakland.edu/SimTel/win3/internet/slnot100.zip">SimTel/win3/internet</A>.
For more information,
see the SlipKnot information page
(URL is <A HREF="http://www.interport.net/slipknot/slipknot.html">
http://www.interport.net/slipknot/slipknot.html </A>) or send
a blank email message to slipknot@micromind.com.
<DT><A NAME="icomm" HREF="http://www.best.com/~icomm/icomm.htm">
I-COMM</A>
<DD>I-COMM, like SlipKnot, operates without a true TCP/IP connection.
It requires a Unix shell account, like SlipKnot, or a 
VMS shell account, a feature unique to I-COMM.
I-COMM also features Zmodem file transfers in
both directions and complete support for forms.
I-COMM is available for evaluation as shareware
(URL is &lt;URL:http://www.best.com/~icomm/icomm.htm&gt ).

<DT><A NAME="emosaic">Enhanced Mosaic</A>
<DD>
Enhanced Mosaic, from Spyglass, Incorporated, is the commercial 
version of NCSA Mosaic. Spyglass does not offer the browser

OEMs. You can learn more about their licensing arrangements
and the existing licensees from the <a href="http://www.spyglass.com/">
Spyglass home page</a> (URL is &lt;URL:http://www.spyglass.com/&gt; ).
<DT><a href="http://www.uni-ulm.de/~richter/udiwww/index.htm">UdiWWW</a>
<DD>UdiWWW, unlike all other Windows browsers as of this writing,
supports all of the proposed HTML 3.0 standard (except for &lt;OVERLAY&gt; and
&lt;MATH&gt;) and also supports Netscape's various nonstandard
extensions. UdiWWW is still being tested, but you can obtain it
for yourself and see 
(URL is &lt;URL:http://www.uni-ulm.de/~richter/udiwww/index.htm&gt; ).
<DT><a href="http://www.twg.com">Emissary</a>

Emissary, from Wollongong, is both a web browser and a concerted effort
to integrate the Internet into the Windows environment
(see &lt;URL:http://www.twg.com&gt; ). For instance, FTP sites
appear much like drives in the file manager, mail can be sent
via drag and drop, and WYSIWYG HTML editing is included.
Emissary supports several Netscape extensions, but lacks support for tables.
