<H1>My CGI scripts don't work. How can I debug them?</H1>
Several common causes are described here. Note that every
web server is different; your mileage will almost
certainly vary. In particular, Windows and Macintosh
servers differ drastically from Unix servers. See
your server's documentation.
<DL>
<DT>The Server Must Recognize Your Program
<DD>
Simply linking from your page to an executable program
or script won't cause it to be run by the server. There are
two common arrangements: either files in 
directories specially designated by the
server administrator are executed as CGI scripts,
or files with a special extension (such as .cgi)
are executed as CGI scripts. 
<P>
These are just two possible ways your server might
be configured. Many sites don't allow users to
run CGI scripts at all. <em>Consult your
web server's administrator.</em>
<DT>Always Output a MIME Type
<DD>
Every CGI script must output a <strong>MIME type</strong> 
indicating what kind of document it is producing. If your script 
outputs an HTML page, the correct format is:
<P>
<code>Content-type: text/html</code>
<P>
Followed by <strong>two</strong> line feeds (ascii 10 decimal).
<P>
<em>After</em> the MIME type, output the desired HTML.
<DT>Always Flush Output
<DD>
On many systems, unexpected problems can result when
a CGI script outputs a MIME type, then executes another
program to generate output. To prevent such problems,
flush standard output before executing other programs.
If your script is written in C, the proper code
is usually: <code>fflush(stdout); </code>
<DT>Permissions and Paths: Why Can't My Script Access My Files?
<DD>
CGI programs typically execute with a current directory and
user ID that differ from your personal home directory and
user ID. When you write CGI programs, make sure any files
accessed are accessed by absolute path (beginning from the
root of the file system). Also, users of multiuser systems
such as Unix may have to grant all users read access or even write access 
to data files using the chmod command. This is not an ideal
situation. Better servers run your CGI programs using your user ID.
Talk to your admin if you have difficulties in this area.
<DT>When One Browser Works and Another Doesn't
<DD>
Some browsers are tolerant of incorrect Content-type
headers, as well as of null characters in text/html
or text/plain output. Make sure your output is strictly
correct; it helps to check the script with Netscape,
Mosaic and Lynx.
