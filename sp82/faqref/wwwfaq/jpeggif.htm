<H1>Which format is better for WWW image purposes, JPEG or GIF?</H1>
<P>
Almost all browsers can view inline JPEG, and there are free libraries
available to do that, so the remaining browser vendors are <strong>very short
on excuses.</strong> There is no need to avoid inline JPEG any longer.
So the proper question is, which format is better for your specific purpose?
<p>
JPEG is for photographic images. GIF is for line-art images, such
as icons, graphs and line-art logos.  You will very likely find that 
JPEG produces smudgy line art and GIF produces large and washed-out 
photographs. Use them accordingly.
<p>
However, <em>never convert GIF to JPEG</em> if you can possibly
help it. Once your photograph has been reduced to the mere 256
colors supported by GIF, it's too late. Go straight from a
lossless 24-bit format supported by your scanner, such as TIFF or PNG, 
to JPEG.
<p>
Since JPEG is an approximate representation of the image,
you shouldn't save things as JPEG and then edit them further later and save 
them again. You can expect progressive loss of quality each time you do that,
especially with different JPEG quality settings. If you must edit
a photographic image, work with it in TIFF or PNG format until it
is ready for publication, then convert it to JPEG for the web.
<p>
If your images can't tolerate being reduced to 8 bits for
GIF <em>or</em> losing precise accuracy for JPEG, TIFF and PNG
are your best options. Web browsers are beginning to
support the latter, and many external viewers
support both. The vast majority of web sites should be
using GIF for line art and JPEG for everything else,
and migrating from GIF to PNG as browser support
for PNG becomes more widely available.
