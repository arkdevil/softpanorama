<H1>I can't get SLIP or PPP. I want web access. Is there a way?</H1>
YES! If you have a plain old Unix shell account on a Unix system, such 
as a SunOS or Ultrix system, there are two ways around the problem:
<DL>
<DT>GUI Browsers that Talk to Unix
<DD>
Microsoft Windows users
can run <A HREF="bwin.htm#slipknot">SlipKnot</A>
or <A HREF="bwin.htm#icomm">ICOMM</A>, special 
browsers which operate using programs that may already be installed
on your shell account (covered in detail in the
MS Windows browsers section).
<DT>SLIP/PPP Emulators
<DD>Anyone with dialup access to a Unix shell account can use 
The Internet Adapter (TIA) or SLiRP, two programs which provide a 
pseudo-SLIP connection.
<P>
SLiRP is free. TIA is not free, but there is a free two-week
trial period and it is inexpensive.
<P>
You can learn more about TIA at
<A HREF="http://marketplace.com/tia/tiahome.html">

<P>
More information on SLiRP is available at

additional help.
<P>
"So what do I run on my machine at home?"
<P>
Exactly the same software you would use for real SLIP; as far
as your PC is concerned, it <em>is</em> a SLIP connection.
If you're unfamiliar with SLIP please check out a newsgroup
relevant to your particular type of machine (Windows, Mac, 
or even Unix-based).
