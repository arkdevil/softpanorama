<em>[Obscure technical answer deleted]</em>
<p>
By now, the Web is becoming a mainstream publishing medium in its
own right. As such, virtually everything is available somewhere
on the Web. Because it is cheaper to publish on the web than it is
to publish on paper or in the other electronic media, a wide range
of interests are represented. This is limited only by the fact
that the population of the Internet is not yet as diverse
as the population of the real world. Fortunately, that is
changing as web access becomes more and more readily
available. 
<p>
The real question is more often <a href="wsearch.htm">
"how do I search the Web to find what I want?"</a> or
perhaps <a href="catalog.htm">"where is the card catalog
of the Web?"</a>. Those questions are also answered
in this document.
