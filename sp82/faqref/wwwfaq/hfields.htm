<H1>How can I keep "state" information between calls to my CGI program?</H1>
<h3>Using Hidden Form Fields</h3>
One valid approach is to use hidden fields in forms. For example:
<PRE>
&lt;INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=state VALUE="hidden info to be returned with form">
</PRE>
By now, most browsers can handle the hidden type, but understand
that some browsers will fail to hide the field (and probably
confuse the user). Note that "hidden" doesn't mean "secret"; the user can 
always click on "view source."
<p>
The ugliness of a "hidden" field appearing on a browser that doesn't
understand hidden fields can be minimized by setting SIZE=0 for
that attribute. 
<h3>Using PATH_INFO</h3>
Another approach is to take advantage of the PATH_INFO
environment variable. PATH_INFO contains any additional text
in the URL that accessed the CGI program *after* the name of
the CGI program itself. For instance, if your CGI program's URL is:
<p>
http://mysite.com/cgi-bin/mycgi
<p>
But you open the following URL instead:
<p>
http://mysite.com/cgi-bin/mycgi/Bob/27
<p>
The program "mycgi" will still be executed -- and the environment
variable PATH_INFO will contain the text <code>/Bob/27</code>. You
can take advantage of this by always outputting URLs that contain
the state information you are trying to keep from one call to the next.
<p>
Keep in mind that URLs are limited to 1024 characters; browsers
are not required to cope with more than that. If you need more,
or dislike long URLs, simply keep the name of a temporary file
in the PATH_INFO section of the URL and store information about
that session in the temporary file. 
<h3>Using HTTP "Cookies"</h3>
"Cookies" are a new mechanism, proposed by Netscape, which allows
the browser to keep state information supplied to it by the server.
The next time a request is made for a URL in a particular portion
of the server, the relevant "cookie" will be sent to the server as 
part of the request! Cookies are currently implemented by
Netscape and by Microsoft's Internet Explorer (2.0). By the time
you read this more browsers may support them. But it is best
to ensure that your pages are still usable without them.
<p>
For example, your CGI program might output the following to set a cookie.
(Note that the Set-Cookie header must appear in its entirety on one line.)
<pre>
Content-type: text/html
Set-Cookie: cookiename=valueofcookie; expires=Saturday, 28-Feb-96 23:59:59 GMT; path=/cgi-bin/mycgiprogram

&lt;h1&gt;Web page follows.&lt;h1&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This sets a cookie which will always be sent <em>back</em> to your
server along with every request for a document on your server with 
a local URL beginning with <code>/cgi-bin/mycgiprogram</code>. The
cookie will continue to be sent until the expiration time. The
expiration time should be set using Greenwich Mean Time as shown
above, but note that the browser may have a poor idea of the local
time zone. For that reason it is best to set cookies to expire at 
least 24 hours in the future.
<p>
When your CGI program is accessed again by the user, the cookies
sent by the browser will appear in the HTTP_COOKIE environment
variable. each cookie will appear as a NAME=VALUE pair; pairs 
will be separated by a semicolon followed by optional
white space. 
<p>
As with form submissions, unusual characters in cookies
should be escaped using the %xx notation (% followed
by two hexadecimal digits specifying the ascii code
of the character).
