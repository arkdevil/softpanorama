<H1>How can users send me comments and/or email?</H1>
There are two ways:
<DL>
<DT>Using a mailto: URL
<DD>
You can simply create a link which looks like this:
<P>
&lt;A HREF="mailto:me@my.address">Send Me Mail&lt;/A>
<P>
This works great for browsers that support the mailto: URL. Perhaps
80% of web users will be able to use such a link. But not
all browsers support it.
<P>
<DT>Installing a comment form
<DD>
If you have access to the server's configuration files, or if your
server administrator permits users to create their own CGI scripts,
you can create a form which sends mail to you from any browser
that supports forms. A really flexible package for this
is the <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/wwwdev/www/dist/mit-dcns-cgi.html">
mit-dcns-cgi package</A> (URL is &lt;URL:http://web.mit.edu/wwwdev/www/dist/mit-dcns-cgi.html&gt; ). I've written a simple 
<A HREF="http://www.boutell.com/email/">email forms package
(URL is &lt;URL:http://www.boutell.com/email/&gt; )</A>,
which does it in ANSI C. There is also a package written
in Perl, known as the <a href="http://www-bprc.mps.ohio-state.edu/mailto/mailto_info.html">
WWW Mailto Gateway</A> (URL is &lt;URL:http://www.mps.ohio-state.edu/mailto/mailto_info.html&gt; ).
<A HREF="http://seclab.cs.ucdavis.edu/~hoagland/">
GetComments</A> (URL is &lt;URL:http://seclab.cs.ucdavis.edu/~hoagland/&gt;) 
is a more general package, also written in Perl, which can
do many different things in response to a form submission.
Tcl programmers may wish to try <a href="http://www.crl.com/~ivler/jmi.html">
J.M. Ivler's TCL mail forms package</a>
&lt;URL:http://www.crl.com/~ivler/jmi.html&gt;.
<p>
<a href="http://www.mornini.com/">InfoMania</a> offers a tool
called Uniform which automatically formats e-mail based on the
input received from a form posting. This "one size fits all"
CGI program is a convenient alternative to writing custom
CGI programs. &lt;URL:http://www.mornini.com/&gt;

Macintosh users should check out
<a href="http://www.biola.edu/cgi-bin/forms/">
forms.acgi</a> &lt;URL:http://www.biola.edu/cgi-bin/forms/&gt;,
a comment-handling package for Macintosh web servers.
