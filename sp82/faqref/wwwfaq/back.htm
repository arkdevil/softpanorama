<H1>Can I put a BACK button in my HTML page?</H1>

The short answer: "no." The user is well aware of the
"back" button in their web browser and will use it
when appropriate. 
<p>
The long answer: if you are writing a CGI program,
you may be able to take advantage of the
HTTP_REFERER environment variable, which sometimes
contains the URL of the page the user came from.
This information is intended to
help you discover which pages link to your own.
However, there is no guarantee that HTTP_REFERER
will be set, or that it will be set to the
immediately previous page. Also, if the user follows
such a link, the real "back" button will not behave
as the user might reasonably expect afterwards. Under 
most circumstances, you are best off exhorting the user to
"back up to the previous page." All web browsers
offer such a feature.
