<H1>Where can I learn how to create fill-out forms?</H1>
Writing an HTML form is easy, but the form doesn't accomplish anything
until you write a CGI program to interpret the results on the
server side! For more information, see 
<A HREF="cgi.htm">the section on CGI scripts</A>.
<p>
<em>"I know how to write CGI programs, I just don't know how
to write forms in HTML."</em>

See the <a href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/">w3 consortium</a> pages
&lt;URL:http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/&gt; for the HTML specification.
Also consult virtually any <a href="books.htm">book</a>
about HTML for information about forms. A good HTML
reference guide is a worthwhile investment.

See the section on <A HREF="emailf.htm">email forms</A> for a
simple solution to the most commonly desired form.
