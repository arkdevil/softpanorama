<H1>I'm running XMosaic. Why can't I get external viewers working?</H1>
<P>
Answer provided by Ronald E. Daniel (rdaniel@acl.lanl.gov):

<P>
Mosaic only looks at the .mime.types file if it has no idea what the
document's type is. This is actually a very rare situation. Essentially
all servers now use the HTTP/1.0 protocol, which means that they tell
Mosaic (or other browsers) what the document's MIME Content-type is. The
servers use a file very much like Mosaic's .mime.types file to infer the
Content-type from the filename's extension.
<P>
It is pretty simple to find out if this really is the problem. Use telnet to
talk to the server and find out if it is assigning a MIME type to the
document in question. Here's an example, looking at the home page for my
server. (idaknow: is my shell prompt)
<pre>
  idaknow: telnet www.acl.lanl.gov 80  // Connect to the httpd server
  Trying 128.165.148.3 ...
  Connected to www.acl.lanl.gov.
  Escape character is '^]'.
  HEAD /Home.html  HTTP/1.0             // replace Home.html  with your document
                                       // you supply the blank line
  HTTP/1.0 200 OK                      // the rest of this comes from the server  Date: Wednesday, 25-May-94 19:18:11 GMT
  Server: NCSA/1.1
  MIME-version: 1.0
  Content-type: text/html              // Here's the MIME Content-type
  Last-modified: Monday, 16-May-94 16:21:58 GMT
  Content-length: 1727

  Connection closed by foreign host.
  idaknow: 
</pre>
In the example above, /Home.html  will get http://www.acl.lanl.gov/Home.html .
<P>

Normally servers will be configured to supply a Content-type of text/plain
if they don't know what else to do. If this is the problem you are having,
take a look at the 
<A HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/setup/httpd/TypesConfig.html"> 
TypesConfig documentation</A> for
<A HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/Overview.html"> 
NCSA's httpd</A>.
You can have the server look at the filename extension, supply the
correct Content-type, then use your local .mailcap file to tell Mosaic
what viewer to use to look at the document.

Russ Segal adds:
<blockquote>
The answer from Ronald Daniel is essentially correct, but it needs a
small addendum.
<P>
When starting Moasic, you can specify a "fileProxy" which will fetch
files for you:
<P>
    <code>"*fileProxy: http://socks/"</code>
<P>
If you do this, file: URLs are no longer strictly local accesses.  So
even if the URL is not http:, the proxy server must be upgraded as Mr.
Daniel suggests.
