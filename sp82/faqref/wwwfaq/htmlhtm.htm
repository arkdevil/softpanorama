<H1>How do I configure my server to recognize both .htm and .html?</H1>
Many web servers run Unix or another operating system that
allows long filenames. Many users, on the other hand, are
stuck with 8.3 filenames under MSDOS and Windows 3.1.
As a result, many users give their documents a .htm
extension and are surprised when servers fail to
automatically recognize this.
<p>
Under the NCSA and Apache web servers for Unix, this can
be easily corrected by adding the following line
to the srm.conf file:
<p>
AddType text/html .htm
<p>
Most servers now ship with both .html and .htm recognized by default.
