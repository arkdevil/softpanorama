<H1>Macintosh browsers</H1>
<P>NOTE: These browsers require that you have SLIP, PPP 
or other TCP/IP networking on your PC. SLIP or PPP can be accomplished 
over phone lines. You can do this one of two ways: using a
proper SLIP account, which requires the active cooperation of your 
network provider or educational institution (see          
<A HREF="http://access.digex.net/~hecker/">Frank Hecker's          
guide to SLIP and PPP access</A>; URL is &lt;URL:http://access.digex.net/~hecker/&gt
; ), or using 
<A HREF="fakeslip.htm">The Internet Adapter or SLiRP</A>, products
which simulate SLIP through your dialup Unix shell account.
If you
only have non-Unix based dialup shell access, or have no PC
at home, your best option at this time is to run 
<A HREF="bunix.htm#lynx">Lynx</A> on the VMS (or Unix, or...) system you call, 
or <A HREF="telnet.htm">telnet to a browser</A> if you cannot do so.

(displaying more than one document in the same
browser window).
Netscape also has strong table support,                    
in addition to many extensions to                          
HTML, not all of which conform to the

Enhanced Mosaic, from Spyglass, Incorporated, is the commercial
version of NCSA Mosaic. Spyglass does sell the browser
directly to the public, although you can download an
evaluation version to try it out; instead, they seek to license it to various
OEMs. You can learn more about their licensing arrangements
and the existing licensees from the <a href="http://www.spyglass.com/">
