<H1>How do I convert HTML to (plain ASCII, Postscript, other printable formats)?</H1>
There are several ways. Most web browsers have a "save as ascii" option;
the quality of the result varies. Lynx, in particular, being a text-based
browser, does a credible job if you select the print option and
choose "print to local file" instead of an actual printer. Graphical
browsers often have a "save as postscript" option; again, quality
varies.
<P>
A product designed expressly for this purpose is
<A HREF="http://www.crl.com/~mikekell/index.html">HTMLCon</A>
(URL is &lt;URL:http://www.crl.com/~mikekell/index.html&gt; ),
a DOS command line application.
<p>
If your browser cannot save as postscript or another format which 
preserves in-line graphics, one option is to use 
<a href="http://home.netscape.com/people/mtoy/cgi/www-print.cgi">
Mozilla Print Gidget</a>
<URL:http://home.netscape.com/people/mtoy/cgi/www-print.cgi>.  You
enter the URL for the page you want to convert and save the
document that comes back.
<p>
Another interesting product is <a href="http://www.faxback.com">FaxBack</a> 
<URL:http://www.faxback.com/>, which allows you to retrieve of any web page 
from a fax machine.
