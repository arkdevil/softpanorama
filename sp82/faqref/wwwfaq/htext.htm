<H1>What are WWW, hypertext and hypermedia?</H1>

WWW stands for "World Wide Web."  The WWW project, started by 
Tim Berners-Lee while at CERN (the European Laboratory for
Particle Physics), seeks to build a "distributed hypermedia
system." In practice, the web is a vast collection of 
interconnected documents, spanning the world. Tim Berners-Lee 
continues his pioneering work with the <A
HREF="w3.htm">W3 Consortium</A> at MIT.
<P>
The advantage of hypertext is that in a hypertext document, if you
want more information about a particular subject mentioned,
you can usually "just click on it" to read further detail. In fact,
documents can be and often are linked to other documents by completely
different authors -- much like footnoting, but you can get the
referenced document instantly!
<P>
To access the web, you run a
browser program.  The browser reads documents, and can fetch documents
from other sources.  Information providers set up <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Overview.html">hypermedia
servers</A> which browsers can get documents from.<P>

The browsers can, in addition, access files by <A
HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu:80/ftp-interface.html">FTP</A>, <A
HREF="news:*">NNTP (the Internet news protocol)</A>, <A
HREF="gopher://gopher.micro.umn.edu:70/11/Information%20About%20Gopher">gopher</A>
and <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/ByAccess.html">an
ever-increasing range of other methods</A>.  On top of these, if the
server has search capabilities, the browsers will permit <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/Products/WAIS/Overview.html">searches
of documents and databases</A>.<P>

The documents that the browsers display are hypertext documents.
Hypertext is text with pointers to other text.  The browsers let you
deal with the pointers in a transparent way -- select the pointer, and
you are presented with the text that is pointed to. <P>

Hypermedia is a superset of hypertext -- it is any medium with
pointers to other media.  This means that browsers might not display a
text file, but might display images or sound or animations.  <P>
