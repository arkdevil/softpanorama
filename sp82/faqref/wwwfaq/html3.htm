<H1>What is HTML Level 3 and where can I learn more about it?</H1>
HTML Level 3, formerly known as HTML+, is an enhanced version of 
HTML designed to address some of the limitations of HTML. HTML Level 3 
supports true <A HREF="tables.htm">tables</A>, right-justified text, 
centered text, line breaks that do not double space, and many other 
desired features.
<P>
However, most clients support only a handful of HTML Level 3 features
at the time of this writing. The most commonly implemented major
feature is table support. If you have access to a Unix system with the
X Window System installed, you can try out many features of
HTML Level 3 using the experimental <A HREF="bx.htm#browsersarena">
Arena</A> browser.
<P>
You can access information about new developments
in HTML at the CERN server

(at the URL

</code>)</A>.
<P>
(HTML Level 1 is the original version. HTML Level 2 is essentially
the same, but with the addition of forms.)
