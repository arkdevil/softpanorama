<H1>How can I make sure my CGI-generated page is not cached by the client?</H1>

If your CGI-generated page is intended to produce completely different
content on each access, it is important to convince the web client
<em>not</em> to display a cached copy the next time the user accesses
it.
<p>
One workaround is to make sure that all links the CGI program
generates to itself contain a unique, random piece of information
which is then ignored by the program when it arrives as part
of the PATH_INFO environment variable. But this is not ideal,
since the user will still see the same output again upon returning
to a bookmark.
<p>
However, consider the following alternatives:
<p>
Some browsers support the Pragma: no-cache header. In this case,
the following output at the beginning of your CGI program will
specify both the content type and the fact that the page should
never be cached:
<p>
<pre>
Content-type: text/html
Pragma: no-cache

</pre>
Note the two carriage returns at the end, always required before the beginning
of the actual document.
<p>
Alternatively, if the page is "good" for some fixed amount of time,
the "Expires:" HTTP header can be used to specify the time after which 
the page must be fetched again. <em>Important:</em> The Greenwich
Mean Time (GMT) must be specified, not the local time.
