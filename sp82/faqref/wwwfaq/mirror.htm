<H1>How can I mirror part of another server?</H1>
Scripts are available to do this, but at this time they are not very
friendly to the server you are attempting to mirror; their behavior
resembles that of the more poorly written <A HREF="robots.htm">WWW robots</A>.
If you are trying to improve access times to a distant server, you
will likely find the "proxy" capabilities of 
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Status.html">
CERN's WWW server</A> to be a more
effective and general solution to your problem.
<p>
If you are interested in mirroring part of a server you control,
perhaps to improve reliability by providing alternatives,
then there are many available mirroring tools. Keep in
mind such simple possibilities as (under Unix) a cron job
that tars and compresses the web site on the "master" server
at a particular time of day, and another cron job 
on the "slave" server which takes advantage of the
lynx browser to retrieve that document, then uncompresses
and untars it. For many purposes, such simple mirroring
setups are effective and near-foolproof.
