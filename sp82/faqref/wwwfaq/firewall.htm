<H1>How can I access the web through a firewall?</H1>
A "proxy server" is a specialized HTTP server which (typically) runs on a firewall 
machine, providing access to the outside world for people inside the
firewall.  <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/httpd">The CERN httpd</A> can be
configured to run as a proxy.  Furthermore, it is able to perform
caching of documents, resulting in faster response times. <P>

For information on using NCSA Mosaic from behind a firewall, please
read the following. In general, browsers can be made useful behind

possible, work <em>with</em> your network administrators
to solve the problem, not against them.

   NCSA Mosaic requires a direct internet connection to work, but some
   folks have put together a package that works behind firewalls. This is

<BLOCKQUOTE>
     <em>November 15, 1993:</em> C&amp;C Software Technology Center (CSTC) of NEC
     Systems Lab has made available a version of SOCKS, a package for
     running Internet clients from behind firewalls without breaching
     security requirements, that includes a suitably modified version of
     Mosaic for X 2.0. <em>Beware: such a version is not supported by NCSA;
     we can't help with questions or problems arising from the
     modifications made by others.</em> But, we encourage you to check it out
     if it's interesting to you. Questions and problem notifications can
     be sent to Ying-Da Lee (<em>ylee@syl.dl.nec.com</em>).
