<H1>How can I serve [Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, doughnuts]?</H1>
In order to deliver documents of new and different types from your
server, you need to configure the correct "content type" for each
type of document, and use the proper extension when naming
the file on the server. If the document type is highly unusual,
you will also need to see to it that users know what content type
to configure their browsers for, and what application to launch
for that content type. 
<p>
Presented below is a list of the better-known content types with
commentary on those the author is familiar with. This information
is drawn from appendix 2 of the author's book,
<a href="http://www.boutell.com/cgibook/">CGI Programming
in C and Perl</a> &lt;URL:http://www.boutell.com/cgibook/&gt;. 
The original list of content types was
taken from the public domain <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">
NCSA web server</a> &lt;URL:http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/&gt;.
<p>
Please note: new media types are coming into existence regularly.
The official registry is often well behind actual practice.
This list is based on that included with NCSA's public domain web
server as of September 1995.
<p>
No attempt is made here to document the
format of the data associated with these mime types. This
list is intended to make it easier to determine what
content type should be assigned to documents produced by
various well-known applications.

<a name="note">
[1]: Browsers should almost never be configured to execute shell
scripts. This is a dangerous practice as the script in question
could simply consist of rm * or another harmful command. Those
interested in sending code to the browser should consider
safe scripting languages such as <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a>, 
Safe-TCL and PGP-SafePerl.
