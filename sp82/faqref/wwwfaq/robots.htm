<H1>Hey, I know, I'll write a WWW-exploring robot! Why not?</H1>
Programs that automatically traverse the web can be quite useful,
but have the potential to make a serious mess of things. Robots
have been written which do a "breadth-first" search of the web,
exploring many sites in a gradual fashion instead of aggressively 
"rooting out" the pages of one site at a time. Some of these
robots now produce excellent indexes of information available
on the web.
<P>
But others have written simple depth-first searches which,
at the worst, can bring servers to their knees in minutes
by recursively downloading information from CGI script-based
pages that contain an infinite number of possible links.
(Often robots can't realize this!) Imagine what happens
when a robot decides to "index" the CONTENTS of several
hundred mpeg movies. Shudder.
<P>
The moral: a robot that does what you want may already exist;
if it doesn't, please study the document

World Wide Web Robots, Wanderers and Spiders
(URL is: http://web.nexor.co.uk/mak/doc/robots/robots.html )</A>
and learn about the emerging standards for exclusion of robots
from areas in which they are not wanted. You can also read
about existing robots there.
