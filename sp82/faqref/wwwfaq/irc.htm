<H1>IRC channels about the web (real-time chat)</H1>

There is an IRC channel dedicated to the World Wide Web.
IRC channels allow Internet users around the world to
discuss topics in real-time. The channel is named, of course, www. 
Please note that the www channel is primarily a place to
give and receive technical help, and do your own
online research first before tuning in.

Jeremy Meyers maintains a 
<a href="http://www.lightning.net/www/wwwfaq.html">FAQ</a>
for this IRC channel &lt;URL:http://www.lightning.net/www/wwwfaq.html&gt;.
If you are unfamiliar with irc, please check out the
newsgroup <a href="news:alt.irc">alt.irc</a> for more
information. IRC clients are available for most
personal computers and for Unix shell accounts
(try the ircII command on many Unix systems; then
type /channel #www to join the www channel).
