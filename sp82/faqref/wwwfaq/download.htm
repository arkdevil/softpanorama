<H1>How can the user download binaries (such as .ZIP and .EXE files) from my server?</H1>

There is no specialized &lt;DOWNLOAD&gt; tag in HTML. Just
do two things: link to the binary in question using
a normal &ltA HREF=...&gt; tag, and make sure that your
web server is configured to output a reasonable
content type for .zip, .ZIP, .exe and .EXE files.
<p>
You probably do not want to edit the mime.types file
of your server, because new versions of this file
regularly become available with new versions of
the web server. Instead, under the NCSA server
and its derivatives, use the <code>AddType</code>
and <code>AddEncoding</code> commands in your
server configuration file. 
After making a change to your configuration files,
always signal the server process to reexamine those
files by using the kill -1 command.
<p>
Consider adding the following lines:
<p>
<pre>
AddType application/zip zip
AddType application/zip ZIP
AddType application/octet-stream exe
AddType application/octet-stream EXE
</pre>

In general, the content type <code>application/octet-stream</code>
is an excellent choice when there is no appropriate
"external viewer." A typical browser will then
prompt the user to save the file. However, if there
<strong>is</strong> a more appropriate content
type, you should of course use that type instead.
<p>
On occasion, users may have encountered very
badly behaved servers which encourage users
to set up a specialized external viewer for the
<code>application/octet-stream</code> content
type. This makes life difficult for everyone.
<strong>Programmers: please don't encourage users to configure
an external viewer for <code>application/octet-stream</code>. 
That content type should be reserved for downloads.
If you have created an external viewer for a brand-new
form of information, invent a new and appropriate content type 
for your application's data and configure your server to output that 
content type. Make your content type known to the public
aand to the authors of web servers so it can be added
to the mime.types file.</strong>

<h3>"How do I suggest a filename?"</h3>
To encourage the user to save the file under an
appropriate filename, do the following:
<ul>
<li>Tell the user exactly what name to save the file under,
in case the web browser is not cooperative and suggests
an absurd filename or no filename at all.
<li>Make sure the URL the user is accessing actually
ends in a reasonable filename. (This warning is
intended primarily for CGI programmers. Under
normal circumstances this is not a problem.)
</ul>

<h3>"So I can use http to download binaries?"</h3>

Yes, and practically all browsers are bright enough to save 
them properly if you follow the suggestions above. 
It is not necessary to use the <code>ftp</code> protocol for
binary downloads.
