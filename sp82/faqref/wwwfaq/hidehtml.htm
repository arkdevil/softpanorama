<H1>Can I hide the HTML of my page so no one can study it?</H1>

<h3>No.</h3>

For better or worse, the answer is no. When the document is displayed, the 
HTML source is there, too; most browsers even have functions like "View Source"
and "Save As HTML." 
<p>
HTML is not particularly complicated; it is essentially a simple
markup language, and it is unlikely that any HTML "trick" will remain
secret for long. Because HTML is simple, this would probably be
the case even if the source were not visible. 
<p>
Good HTML <em>style</em>, on the other hand, is a subtle thing and
requires a high degree of consistency and editorial sense (not
always displayed in this document, I'll admit). It is unlikely
that anyone will succeed in stealing your "style" using the
"View Source" button, although they may pick up a few tricks.
