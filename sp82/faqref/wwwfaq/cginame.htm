<H1>How can I identify the user who is accessing my CGI script?</H1>

Five important environment variables are available to your CGI script
to help in identifying the end user. 
<DL>
<DT>HTTP_FROM
<DD>
This environment variable is, theoretically, set to the email address
of the user. However, many browsers do not set it at all, and most
browsers that do support it allow the user to set any value for
this variable. As such, it is recommended that it be used only
as a default for the reply email address in an email form.
<DT>REMOTE_USER
<DD>
This variable only set if <a href="security.htm">secure authentication</a>
was used to access the script. The AUTH_TYPE variable can be checked
to determine what form of secure authentication was used. REMOTE_USER
will then contain the name the user authenticated under. Note that
REMOTE_USER is only set if authentication was actually used,
and is not supported by all web servers. Authentication may
unexpectedly fail to happen under the NCSA server if the
method used for the transaction is not listed in the
access.conf file (ie, &lt;Limit GET POST&gt; should be
set rather than the default, &lt;Limit GET&gt;).
<DT>REMOTE_IDENT
<DD>
This variable is set if the server has contacted an IDENTD server
on the client machine. This is a slow operation, usually turned off
in most servers, and there is no way to ensure that the client machine
will respond honestly to the query, if it responds at all.
<DT>REMOTE_HOST
<DD>
This variable will not identify the user specifically, but does provide
information about the site the user has connected from, if the hostname
was retrieved by the server. In the absence of any certainty regarding 
the user's precise identity, making decisions based on a list of trusted 
addresses is sometimes an adequate workaround. This variable is not set
if the server failed to look up the host name or skipped the lookup
in the interest of speed; see REMOTE_ADDR below. Also keep in mind that
you may see all users of a particular proxy server listed under
one hostname.
<DT>REMOTE_ADDR
<DD>
This variable will not identify the user specifically, but does provide
information about the site the user has connected from.
REMOTE_ADDR will contain the dotted-decimal IP address of the client.
In the absence of any certainty regarding 
the user's precise identity, making decisions based on a list of trusted 
addresses is sometimes an adequate workaround. This variable is 
always set, unlike REMOTE_HOST, above.
Also keep in mind that you may see all users of a particular proxy server 
listed under one address.
