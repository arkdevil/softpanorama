<H1>Where is the subject catalog of the web?</H1>
There are several. There is no mechanism inherent in the web which
forces the creation of a single catalog (although there is work
underway on automatic mechanisms to catalog web sites). Also be
sure to check out the entry on <a href="wsearch.htm">how to
search the web</a>.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</A> 
(URL is &lt;URL:http://www.yahoo.com/&gt; ) is probably
the most complete hierarchical, topical index of web sites, and
also features a sophisticated search facility. 
<P>
The original catalog of the web was the
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html">
WWW Virtual Library</A>
(URL is http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html ),
maintained by CERN and later by the W3 Consortium. The Virtual Library is 
a good place to find resources on a particular subject, and has separate 
maintainers for many subject areas.
