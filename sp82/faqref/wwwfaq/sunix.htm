<DL>
<DT>NCSA httpd
<DD>NCSA is the source of one of the oldest Unix web servers,
and still one of the best, known as the NCSA httpd;
it is available at the URL
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Web/httpd">
ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Web/httpd</A>. Versions 1.5
and later support HTTP Keep-Alive, which improves efficiency
when the server is communicating with a compatible web browser
such as Microsoft Internet Explorer.
More information is available 
<a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/">at NCSA</a>
&lt;URL:http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/&gt;.
<DT><a href="http://www.stack.urc.tue.nl/~sven/xs-httpd/">XS-HTTPD</a>
<DD>XS-HTTPD is a small, fast, back-to-basics web server.
XS-HTTPD supports CGI and other standard features, executes
a user's CGI programs under that user's own ID, and preforks
a fixed number of copies of itself for performance
(like most other fast servers). 
&lt;URL:http://www.stack.urc.tue.nl/~sven/xs-httpd/&gt;
<DT><a href="http://www.apache.org/apache/">Apache httpd</a>
<DD>Apache is a powerful, reliable drop-in replacement for the NCSA httpd.
&lt;URL:http://www.apache.org/apache/&gt; Note that a version which
supports <a href="http://www.algroup.co.uk/Apache-SSL">
SSL for secure transactions</a> is also
available. &lt;URL:http://www.algroup.co.uk/Apache-SSL&gt;
<DT>w3 httpd
<DD>The w3 consortium httpd, originally developed at CERN, is available 
for anonymous FTP from ftp.w3.org
(URL is <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Status.html">
<code>http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Status.html </code></A>) and 
many other places. The w3 server is currently the only free server
able to act as a caching proxy. 
<DT><a href="http://www.spyglass.com/products/server_download.html">
Spyglass httpd</a>
<DD>Spyglass offers a Unix web server, free of charge.
The server claims higher speeds than other commercial and
free servers and offers benchmark tests to back them up. 
CGI, authentication, a faster non-CGI programming
interface and other common server features are included.
&lt;URL:http://www.spyglass.com/products/server_download.html&gt;
<DT>Netscape's Netsite Servers
<DD>Netscape Communications Corporation offers two 
server products,
high-end <A HREF="http://www.mcom.com/comprod/netscape_commerce.html">
Netscape Commerce Server</A> (capable of secure transactions) and
the less expensive <A HREF="http://www.mcom.com/comprod/netscape_commun.html">
Netscape Communications Server</A>. Both products feature a more efficient
replacement for <A HREF="cgi.htm">CGI</A> (common gateway interface)
programming and are designed to be more efficient than traditional
free-of-charge servers such as the NCSA and CERN http demons.
<DT>Compuserve Internet Office Web Server
<DD>Compuserve's Internet division (formerly Spry) offers the
<a href="http://www.compuserve.com:80/prod_services/corp_solutions/ioff_server/ioff_server.html">
Internet Office Web Server</a>, available for both Unix and Windows NT.
The standard edition can be tried out for free. The professional
edition includes editing tools and supports S-HTTP security and
SQL database connectivity.
<DT>GN Gopher/HTTP server
<DD>The GN server is unique in that it can serve both WWW and
Gopher clients (in their native modes). This is a good server for
those migrating from Gopher to WWW, and includes some of the more
powerful web server features as well (such as CGI scripts).
See the URL <A
HREF="http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/">http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/. </A>
<DT>Perl server
<DD>There is also a server written in the Perl scripting language,
called <A HREF="http://bsdi.com/server/doc/plexus.html">Plexus</A>,
for which documentation is available at the URL 
http://bsdi.com/server/doc/plexus.html .
<DT><A NAME="wnserver">WN Server</A>
<DD>The <A HREF="http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/docs/manual.html">WN Server</A>,
available at the URL http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/docs/manual.html , is designed
with an emphasis on security and flexibility, and takes a different
approach from the NCSA and CERN servers. It provides text searching
facilities as a standard feature.
<DT>EIT httpd
<DD>EIT has created the Webmaster's Starter Kit, which installs
their WWW server on your system via the web through a painless
forms interface. Recommended for those unfamiliar with
server installation.  You can learn more about the starter
kit and the EIT httpd at the <A HREF="http://wsk.eit.com/wsk/doc/">
starter kit site</A> (URL is
http://wsk.eit.com/wsk/doc/ ). 
<DT>Phttpd
<DD>The <A HREF="ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/phttpd/">Phttpd Server</A>,
available by anonymous FTP from ftp.lysator.liu.se in the directory
pub/phttpd, is a multithreaded server for Sun's Solaris 2.X operating
system which takes advantage of memory mapping and dynamic linking
to achieve excellent performance.
<DT><a href="http://www.openmarket.com">Open Market Web Servers</a>
<DD>Open Market offers two commercial products, WebServer and the Secure 
WebServer. The latter supports the Secure HTTP and SSL standards for secure
transactions. Both are multithreaded for efficiency and emphasize
strong logging features and access control
(URL is &lt;URL:http://www.openmarket.com&gt; ).
<DT><a href="http://spinner.infovav.se/">Spinner</a>
<DD>Spinner is a free web server for Unix platforms which supports
extensive server-side parsing of documents, completely avoids forking
for non-CGI accesses, and supports multiple roots for multiple
host names (URL is &lt;URL:http://spinner.infovav.se/&gt; ).
<DT><A HREF="http://www.navisoft.com/index.htm">Navisoft Server</a>
<DD>The Navisoft Server is available for Windows NT, as well as
many Unix platforms, and interfaces directly to a back-end database
for powerful search capabilities. &lt;URL:http://www.navisoft.com/index.htm&gt;
<DT><A HREF="http://www.cerf.net/~paulp/boa/">Boa</a>
<DD>Boa is a single-process server. While it does not have every
advanced feature, it is interesting because it internally
multiplexes all of the ongoing http connections and forks only
to handle CGI programs. This should translate into remarkable
speed when serving normal documents. 
See <a href="http://www.cerf.net/~paulp/boa/">
&lt;URL:http://www.cerf.net/~paulp/boa/&gt;</a> for more information.
<DT><A HREF="http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/">thttpd</a>
<dd>thttpd, the "tiny/turbo/throttling HTTP server", is much
like Boa in that it takes a single-process approach. thttpd
handles only the GET and HEAD methods and emphasizes
simplicity and very low resource consumption. It isn't
suitable for everything, but it serves simple documents
very quickly! It also has a feature which is currently
unique: thttpd can limit the pace of accesses to particular URLs.
&lt;URL:http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/&gt;
<DT><A HREF="http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/iiip/doc/cl-http/server.html">
Common Lisp Hypermedia Server (CL-HTTP)</a>
<dd>
The CL-HTTP server                                                              
&lt;URL:http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/iiip/doc/cl-http/server.html&gt;
is a web server written entirely in Common Lisp. It is available on
many platforms, and can be programmed at a remarkably high level,
using Lisp code to generate much of the output of the server.
An interesting option when development time is limited.
