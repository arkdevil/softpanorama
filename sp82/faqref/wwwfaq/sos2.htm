<p>
While OS/2 can take advantage of most Windows software, native
OS/2 web servers perform better in the OS/2 environment.
<p>
In addition to consulting the list of servers below,
be sure to check out Don Meyer's excellent
<a href="http://w3.ag.uiuc.edu/DLM/HTTPDforOS2.html">
HTTPD for OS/2 page</a> &lt;URL:http://w3.ag.uiuc.edu/DLM/HTTPDforOS2.html&gt;,
which provided much of the information for the latest update of this section.

<DT><A HREF="http://www2.hursley.ibm.com/goserve/">goserve for OS/2</A>
<DD>goserve (URL is &lt;URL:http://www2.hursley.ibm.com/goserve/&gt; )
is a one-piece World Wide Web and Gopher for OS/2. Designed for
ease of installation.
<DT><A NAME="os2httpd" HREF="ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/kf/kfan/overview.html">OS2HTTPD</a>
<DD>An OS/2 server based on NCSA's Unix HTTPD, ported by Frankie Fan. See 
the home page (URL is <A HREF="ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/kf/kfan/overview.html">
ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/kf/kfan/overview.html </A>) for details, or
fetch the package by anonymous FTP from ftp.netcom.com in the
directory pub/kf/kfan.

IBM Internet Connection Server for OS/2</a>
<DD>The IBM Internet Connection Server is a commercial product,
and requires the High Performance File System (HPFS).

<DT><A HREF="http://w3.ag.uiuc.edu/DLM/HTTPDforOS2.shtml#OS2WWW">OS2WWW</a>
<DD>
OS2WWW is a shareware server for OS/2. OS2WWW, like OS2HTTPD, is a port
of the NCSA Unix HTTPD. However, OS2WWW has been rewritten to take
advantage of OS/2 "threads" instead of creating a new process for
every new connection, and performance should be better than that
of OS2WWW. &lt;URL:http://w3.ag.uiuc.edu/DLM/HTTPDforOS2.shtml#OS2WWW&gt;
<DT><A HREF="http://www.slink.com/ApacheOS2/">Apache for OS/2</a>
<DD>A port of the popular freeware Apache server for Unix,
Apache for OS/2 offers many of the same features.

<DT><A HREF="http://w3.ag.uiuc.edu/DLM/HTTPDforOS2.shtml#CERN">
W3 HTTPD with Proxy Support</a>
<DD>
An OS/2 port of the W3 Consortium HTTPD server (originally developed
by CERN) is now available for OS/2. This is currently the only
OS/2 server capable to serve as a proxy.
