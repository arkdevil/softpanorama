<H1>What's a progressive JPEG? How can I make one?</H1>

"Progressive" JPEG is a new variation on the JPEG image format.
(This document also offers a <a href="jpeggif.htm">comparison
of the JPEG and GIF formats.) Progressive JPEGs are like
<a href="tinter.htm">interlaced GIFs</a> in that they 
"fade in" gradually instead of being drawn from top to bottom.
This enables the viewer to understand what the image is about
very quickly. 
<p>
Progressive JPEG is much smoother than progressive GIF.
<p>
There is one problem: most web browsers <strong>don't support
progressive JPEG yet.</strong> This means that progressive JPEG
images will <em>not</em> display in those browsers at all
(they will appear to be "broken"). Netscape's Netscape
Navigator 2.0 beta 1 and Spyglass' Enhanced Mosaic 2.1f5
and later <strong>do</strong> support progressive JPEG.
<p>
<em>A note to browser authors:</em> the independent JPEG group library
supports progressive JPEG, so get off your butts and implement
it! This is impressive stuff, and there are no fees to use
the technology.
<p>
"OK, I understand that not everyone can see progressive JPEGs yet.
How do I make these nifty new images?"

page on the subject, including information about their Image Transmogrifier 
software, which can produce progressive JPEG images.
