<H1>How can I redirect the browser to a different page?</H1>

It is possible to redirect the browser to a different
URL, effectively "forwarding the call" to a different page.
To do this, either take advantage of the redirection
features offered by your web server or write a CGI
program which outputs the following:
<pre>
Location: http://desiredsite.com/desiredpath/document.html

</pre>

Note that two line breaks must follow this line.
<p>
A few older browsers may have difficulty following
such directives. You can combat this problem by outputting 
a short page of HTML to the user after the above
information, explaining that the page has moved.
<p>
There are also a few browsers which expect
to see a <code>URI:</code> header as well as
a <code>Location:</code> header. If you wish
to be agonizingly thorough, output both
headers before the double line break.
