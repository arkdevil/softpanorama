<H1>How can I create animations in my web page?</H1>
There are now several ways to create animations in
a web page. These include server push, GIF89 multi-part
image files, MPEG and QuickTime plug-ins, Shockwave,
and various Java applets designed to present animations.
<p>
At the moment, nearly all of these options are limited
to various versions of the Netscape browser only.
Right now, the best way to create simple animations that 
can be seen by any user of Netscape 2.0 for any platform
without breaking other browsers too severely
is probably GIF89 animation. This is an especially
good solution because these multi-part GIF files
simply display their first frame (and do not animate)
on browsers that don't support animation. This works
because the GIF89 standard has included the little-used
multi-image feature for a long time and existing GIF
viewers know how to at least ignore the later frames. This is
an easy way to achieve backwards compatibility
with older browsers.
<p>
One tool that can be used to create such GIF89 animations
on the PC platform is <a href="http://www.fastlane.net/~samiel">
GIFMake</a> &lt;URL:http://www.fastlane.net/~samiel&gt;. 
Tools are also available for other platforms
(submissions welcome!).
<p>
One note of warning: Netscape always delays 
one-tenth of a second between frames, regardless
of the frame delay you set in your GIF89 file.
