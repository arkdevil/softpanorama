<H1>Introduction: how can I access the web?</H1>

You have two basic options: use a browser on your own machine
(the best option) or use a browser that can be telnetted to
(not nearly as good, but possible). Web access by email
is available, but very marginal. Note, however, that the
traditional online services such as AOL, Prodigy, and 
Compuserve now offer web access of one degree or another
as a standard feature. Real web access is finally easy
to come by for all PC users, at least in North America.
<p>
It is always best to <A HREF="index.htm#browsers">run a browser
on your own machine</A>, unless you absolutely cannot do so; but feel
free to telnet to a browser for your first look at the web, or
use email if the telnet command does not work on your system
(<em>try it first!</em>). Note that "your machine" can be
defined as a system you dial into from home, such as netcom or
another account provider. Running a text-based browser on such a
system is still preferable to telnetting to a faraway site.
<P>
Access to the web <strong>by email</strong> is possible once again,
but obtaining a better grade of Internet
access that allows you to run a web browser is strongly encouraged.
To use the service, send mail to webmail@curia.ucc.ie with 
"go http://www.boutell.com/faq/" in the body of
your mail (don't type the quotation marks). You will
receive the top page of the web version of this FAQ, which
you can use as a starting point for your explorations.
<P>
There is one low-tech solution: web by FAX! Consider the
following information, submitted by Bill Stearns:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  If you have access to a fax machine, do the following:
<P>1) Call 805-730-7777 from your fax machine.
<P>2) Select number 2 (I have the document ID already)
<P>3) Type in the document ID; for the above page, it's 17571, then press
# (the pound symbol)
<P>4) Press pound at the next prompt if you're calling from your fax
machine, or enter the phone number of your fax machine and then press
pound.
<P>5) Wait for that page to come over, and then repeat the process with
the 5 or 6 digit number in brackets next to the link you'd like to
follow.

<P>A few other useful pages:
<P>17581   800 number (toll-free) service providers
<P>17582   The list of area codes - a good place to start as well if
        you're in the U.S.

<P>        By the way, this free service is provided by 
<A HREF="http://www.ua.com/">Universal Access</A>
(http://www.ua.com/, document number 16968) and is not limited to just
this directory.  If you know the name of the machine hosting the web
page you want to view, you can probably reach it through this service.
You simply type in the name of the machine (www.teleport.com, for
example) at menu option 3.  When you've received the home page for
the site, keep following the trail to the page you'd like.  It takes
a while and some long distance calls, but the service is otherwise
free.
<P>        My sincere thanks both to Universal Access and the Celestin
company for providing these services.
