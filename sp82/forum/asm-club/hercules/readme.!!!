General

Included are the following files:

 - readme.!!!             - guess !
 - hercules.asm           - sample program using hercules routines
 - hercules.com           - executable of ... (see below)
 - h_shoot.asm            - Another sample, TSR this time !
 - h_shoot.asm            - executable of ... (see below)
 - hercules.doc           - complete manual covering all routines (MSWORD format!!!)
 - hercules.txt           - same manual, but plain text this time !
 - hercules.inc           - the hercules routines !!! print 2hex scroll etc.

As the names of the files imply: they all use (and need) a hercules screen !

using the hercules screen
-------------------------
The principle of using a hercules screen is very simple, that is when you are
used to directly write to the screen when displaying texts etc. The only
thing you need to know for that is the address where to write your data to,
it's the same as normal memory ! To display texts on a VGA screen write to
segment 0B800h, for a Hercules-screen use segment 0B000h (these different
addresses make it possible to use them together !). Both screens are built up
as follows:
        position:  1                   80
  0B800    ---->   cacacacacaca .... caca
 (or 0B000)        cacacacacaca .... caca

Where c is the character (1 byte, ascii character) and a is the atribute byte.
You probably know the meaning of the bits in it, if you don't, just place
a list showing them all on the screen.

Writing directly to the screen is far the fastest way to display things.
Often it is not used for compatiblity reasons, but today you can savely use
this method, you decide. Good multitaskers should be compatible with it !
Since I wrote these routines just debugging etc. (and when I started just for
myself) I just used the easiest and fastest way.

hercules.inc
------------
This file contains all the routines I have made so far. If anyone has
anything to append to it, I'd be really happy to receive it from you !!!

hercules.asm
------------
Just a simple sample program that I used to test the routines. It uses some
of the print-routines, the scroll-routine and the conversion routines from
binary to hex. Run hercules.com to see the result.

h_shoot.asm
-----------
The second test-program I wrote to really test the routines on speed and
wether they'd work within a TSR. Run h_shoot.com multiple times and see what
happens !

do with it ...
--------------
what you like. I'd really like you to credit me for it when you use them, but
I leave that up to you !

As I said: if you improve the routines or have any great ideas, let me know !
