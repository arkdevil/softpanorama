1.0    3/25/96    Minor Distribution

    The first release.

1.1    4/2/96     Widespread distribution

    Fixed table generation so that the </tr> ended each row.

    Corrected the ReadHTML so that it will recognize a one line HTML Command.

    Changed hint for view in-line image button to be more clearer.

    Fixed the Evaluate mode so that it would allow the search for graphics in
     a specified directory since some authors put images in a different
     location.

    When searching for images we were looking for 'img' and that would pull up
     images that were in comments.  Changed it to look for '<img' instead.

    Set up the graphical viewer so that it will stay in place when the Web
     page has been modified.

    Added the Registration Key so that users can simply enter a name and
     valid key sequence.

    Lot of straightening out the interface.  So buttons lined up and dialog
     windows looked centered.

    Added standard HTML tags menu option.

    Added the ability to create a list of tags.  This allows for the growth
     of Web-It! when new tags are made into standards or extensions.

1.2 5/12/96

    When selecting a file from the previously loaded files it did not ask if
     you wanted to save the changed file currently in the editor.  It does now.

    If you loaded one of the previously 4 loaded files it did not move it to
     the top of the list.  It does now.

    Implemented the disabling features which are mentioned in the help file.
     Also set to disable after 30 days is the ability to view inline images.

    Fixed the <p> command so it issued the opening and closing codes, <p></p>.

    Fixed a bug in the Frame settings.  When only one cell was used in a single
     row the appropriate frame information was not being inserted.

    Added the ability to save and restore frame setting files.  From the menu
     choose either Load or Save.  It looks for the default extention of .SET but
     you may use whatever you desire.  It creates a .SET which stores the frame
     locations and a .PAR file that stores the parameters for each frame. (Works
     in the evaluation version.

    Added the ability to save and restore map coordinates to a file. From the
     menu choose either Load or Save Web-It! Coordinate File. It looks for the
     default extention of .COR but you may use whatever you desire.  (This
     feature does not work in the evaluation version.)

    Took out the June and December time expirations for eval copies.  A reminder
     will appear stating that the copy may be old and to visit our web site to
     obtain the latest version.

    If you had the 'Auto Update HTML Viewer' turned on and typed to fast a GPF
     would occur.  Seems to be fixed now.

    When loading an image it displayed BMP & PCX files, which are not really
     supported on the internet so they were removed from the default listing
     filter.

1.21 5/14/96
    Oops!  Completely forgot about printing the HTML text file itself.  Its there
     now.

1.25 6/18/96
    In the registered version, if you called the program from a directory other
     than the installed directory the registration key did not initiate.

    Removed the 'Read Only' checkbox from the file save dialog box.

    Speled Separate correctly.<g>

    Added the ability to automate special characters by scanning for them
     at entry time.  For instance, when the keystroke that is equal to
     &Aacute; is entered the code is automatically entered into the editor.

    Added the ability to highlight a color, background, src and lowsrc and
     click on the Properties Button in the third button bar on the right side.
     Just place your cursor on one of these keywords and double click.  It
     should highlight the whole phrase.  For instance clicking on src below:

                     <img src="test.gif"><p>One way to do

     will highlight 'src="test.gif"><p>One', then click on the property button.
     the tag, the equal and the quote must be adjacent.  When selecting a color
     like the link="#ff9323" the ="# must all be adjacent.
