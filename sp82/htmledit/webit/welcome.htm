Greetings fellow Web Author,<br>
We have put alot of work into making Web-It! a first class editor and we hope you will enjoy using it as much as we have enjoyed writing it.  This is an evaluation copy of the Standard Edition of Web-It!.  There is also a Professional Edition which contains support for Netscape frames, forms and in-line image maps.  You will be able to see these items function but will not be able to save any of the work created by these tools.  See the help file or the closing screen of this application for ordering information.
<p>
Please refer to the file UPDATES.DOC to be updated on any added features that did not make it into the help file.
</p>
<p>
If you create a web page using Web-It! we would greatly appreciate it if you would put the above banner on your page showing your visitors how you created your masterpiece and help us to spread the word about Web-It!
<p>
<center><H3>We also would like you to know that Web-It! has been selected as the 'Best Communications/Internet Tool' in the 1996 Shareware Industry Awards.</H3></center></p>
<i><u><b><center>Enjoy and we hope to hear from you soon!</center></b></u></i><p>
