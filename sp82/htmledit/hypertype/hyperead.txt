HyperType Edit 1.0b by Brent Leimenstoll HyperType Designs Software

http://users.aol.com/nutfact/hypeedit.htm

This is the first public release of this HTML editor.

There is no help file included as I am looking for input in how to improve
the product before I release the full version.

This editor can create a document for the WWW in the HyperText Markup
Language that WWW browsers support. It contains over 130 normal tags,
quick color bar for quick access to the most popular colors (just a double click)
adds the hex code to the document). You can hid or show portions of the 
toolbar to add working space. Full support for MSIE 2.0 and Netscape 2.0.

This is a raw, stand-alone editor.

To install:  

a:)unzip the file into any directory

b:)run hypetype.exe and thats all there is

c:) enjoy!
