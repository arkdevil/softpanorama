Foreign users:  Please provide  an  Internet-reachable  e-mail  address  in  all
correspondence if you have any hope of getting a reply!  Internet e-mail is  the
preferred method of contact for all  other  users  as  well.   America  On-Line,
CompuServe, and Prodigy all offer Internet e-mail access so get with it!

Since these programs are typically "freeware"  (with  the  exception  of  people
trying to make money from them instead of me), they generate maybe $100/year  in
revenue for me.  As such, my ability to afford  wonderful  customer  support  is
somewhat restricted.   Please  do  not  leave  messages  saying  "Call  me  long
distance".  Also, please be specific  about  what  problems  you  encounter  and
include command-line inputs as well as any control  or  INI  files  that  you're
using.

The "production" releases of these programs are posted  directly  by  me  (Bruce
Guthrie, the author) on the Simtel ftp site at ftp.coast.net.  More  information
about locations at this site is provided later.  People are encouraged to upload
them to bulletin board systems but I do not upload them to BBS's myself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  Introduction

This documentation provides some overview information on a number of  utilities.
All  programs  described  herein  were  written  by  Bruce  Guthrie.   Most  are
distributed with a Wayne Software copyright.  Others were written for  the  U.S.
Department of Commerce.  All are free for use provided relevant documentation is
kept with the programs, no changes are made to the  programs  or  documentation,
and they are not bundled with commercial programs or charged for separately.

CHANGE,  CONVERT,  FILUPDAT,   READ,   and   READY   are   excluded   from   the
commercial-packaging  restriction.   These  programs  are  owned  by  the   U.S.
Department of Commerce and may be re-distributed without restriction.

People who need to bundle AV, BFIND, COPSINCE, DATES, DIRCOMP, DIRTOTAL, EUMAIL,
FILL, FIXTEXT, FORTUNE, HTMSTRIP, PAGINATE, READINIT, or TXTABLE  in  commercial
packages other than shareware/freeware collections must pay a  $50  registration
fee to "Wayne Software" at the following address.   READMAKE-created  files  are
also subject to this limitation.  I don't expect to make any  money  from  these
utilities but I don't want others to sell them instead.

This collection of utilities were compiled using Microsoft's  Visual  BASIC  for
DOS 1.0 compiler.  Thomas G. Hanlin III's excellent  PBClone  routines,  release
2.3, provided additional functionality.  Since Tom has dropped support  for  his
PBClone routines, some things will are simply not possible for me to do so don't
push!  The basic routines should be able to be maintained indefinitely  as  long
as DOS continues to exist; we'll see.  I keep thinking that I  should  be  doing
Windows programming but it's hard to get psyched up for that when you  think  of
Windows as a computer virus.

Documentation provided in appropriate ZIP files:
 * routine.DOC: Each utility is separately described in a like-named *.DOC file.
 * FILE_ID.DIZ: Standard Description In Zip file.
 * BRUCEymm.DOC: This file serves to summarize all  of  the  various  utilities.
     The "ymm" indicates the release date in  year/month  format.   "601"  means
     1996, first month (Jan 1996).
 * BRUCEINI.DOC: Most of the routines have defaults that can  altered  by  using
     initialization files (inifiles).   These  are  referenced  in  the  regular
     documentation and further described here.  (One thing about *.INI files; if
     you don't have one, it's in your interests to specify the "/-I"  parameter.
     Otherwise, the program searches your entire DOS path looking for the file.)
 * BRUCEHEX.DOC: Many of the routines allow you to enter  parameters  as  either
     hexadecimal  or  decimal  strings.   This  is  referenced  in  the  regular
     documentation and further described here.

     All program documentation was created  using  a  text  editor  (PE2).   The
     PAGINATE command (see below) was  used  to  justify  the  text  and  create
     titles, page breaks, and (where provided) indexes.

Beta  testers  and  suggestions  are  always   appreciated.    Contact   me   at
bguthrie@nmaa.org  Note that all beta releases are done via e-mail  so  if  your
gateway can't handle some pretty big mail attachments,  you  definitely  do  NOT
want to be a beta tester for me!  Modifications that are not of  mainstream  use
can be contracted for.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           Short program descriptions

   AV.EXE:  Archive directory viewer.  Presents list of files in  archive  (ZIP,
   ARC, etc) and lets you sort as desired.  Also allows resetting  of  the  file
   date based on the archive's contents.

   BFIND.EXE:  Allows Boolean-type FIND requests.  For example,  find  any  line
   with one string AND another one, or any line  with  one  string  OR  another.
   Also allows wildcarded input file names.

   CHANGE.EXE:  Processes change commands in files.  Files can be  of  any  size
   and type (e.g.  binary or text) and are  processed  quickly.   Up  to  thirty
   change commands can be processed in a single pass.  Also provides ability  to
   remove trailing spaces from text files.

   CONVERT.EXE:  Converts between data  formats:   FROM  dBase,  ASCII-delimited
   (typically commas between fields and quotes around strings), and fixed  field
   TO Lotus WKS, ASCII-delimited, dBase, and fixed field.

   COPSINCE.EXE:  Copies all files modified since a given date.  Primarily  used
   for making sure you have a back-up of files and also to copy updated programs
   to another place.  Lets you define your own groupings of files if desired.

   DATES.EXE:  Program that warns you in advance when an event like a  birthday,
   anniversary, or holiday is coming up.   The  idea  is  to  give  you  advance
   warning so you can send a card or get out of town in time.

   DIRCOMP.EXE:  Similar in some ways to DOS's REPLACE command but adds  ability
   to delete extra files in the destination subdirectory, copy hidden and system
   files, and prepare a report showing inconsistencies.  Is frequently  used  by
   network administrators to update workstation files.

   DIRTOTAL.EXE:  Prepares  report  showing  files  in  subdirectory  or  drive.
   Allows restricting search based on date, size,  attributes,  etc.   Works  on
   networked and CD-ROM drives.   Produces  more  formalized  report  than  some
   utilities do.  Also allows you to look for duplicate file names.

   EUMAIL.EXE:  Eudora mail summarizer.  Dumps your Qualcomm Eudora mailbook  as
   well as summarizing the contents of all of your Eudora boxes and folders.

   FILL.EXE:  Program designed to move files off to floppy diskettes, taking the
   biggest files first and skipping those that won't fit.  Also provides  option
   of splitting large files up, creating a status report, and other features.

   FILUPDAT.EXE:  Program which compares a selected list of files  in  a  source
   path against those in another path and copies those that have  been  updated.
   Similar to DOS' REPLACE command  but  works  from  a  stored  list  of  files
   (controlled updates) and can handle any number of directories.

   FIXTEXT.EXE:  Program which applies  a  user-definable  character-translation
   table to a text file.  Can allow you to convert graphics characters to  their
   text equivalents, lowercase letters to uppercase letter, etc.   Can  also  be
   used to translate DOS text files to Mac or Unix text files  and  vice  versa.
   Can also expand tabs, remove trailing spaces, and remove backspaces.

   FORTUNE.EXE:  A tuner-upper for the DOS FOR command.  Generates a batch  file
   which does all those wildcard things you wished FOR could do  (like  "FORTUNE
   IN (*.BAS) DO RENAME %A %2*.*" to remove parts of file names).  Lets  you  do
   all sorts of things including  distinguishing  file  name  roots  from  their
   extensions as well as incrementing file names by specified values.

   HTMSTRIP.EXE:  Goes  through  downloaded  pages  from  the  Web  and  removes
   embedded HTML commands.  Reflows paragraphs and tries to  make  it  basically
   readable.

   PAGINATE.EXE:  Reformats text files with embedded formatting codes.   Handles
   things like titles, footers, indexes, alignment,  justification,  multicolumn
   listings,  etc.   Also  provides  support  for  embedding  tabular  data   in
   ASCII-delimited or dBase formats which can be embedded and/or sorted in  your
   reports.

   READ.EXE, READY.EXE, READINIT.EXE,  and  READMAKE.EXE:   Text  file  browsing
   utilities.  READ--Supports marking, copying text, reading Unix and  Mac  text
   files, etc.  Handles files of 16,000 lines or less  (approx  800,000  bytes).
   READY--truncates or wraps lines over 255 characters  in  length  but  handles
   files of an unlimited number of lines.  READMAKE--Takes  an  ASCII-text  file
   and makes it self-viewable (using a READ clone).

   TXTABLE.EXE:  Program to generate text tables.  Includes quickie utility that
   dumps WordPerfect file into something this can read so you can try to convert
   WordPerfect tables to text.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                Revision history

Detailed revision histories for the programs are only maintained  for  the  last
three releases.  After that, you get the major revision summaries only  for  the
next three releases or so.  In any  case,  if  your  version  of  any  of  these
programs is more than a year old, your version is definitely obsolete.  Hop onto
the Web or e-mail me or something and get the new version!

-------------- (full detail; revisions made 1 to 3 months ago)
Release 96/04:

This release comes up  as  Secretary  of  Commerce  Ron  Brown  gets  buried  at
Arlington.  I work at the Department of Commerce and had the chance to meet  him
a couple of times.  I thought he was a very special person.  I'll miss him!

Major updates are now being posted directly on both Simtel sites  (ftp.coast.net
and ftp.simtel.net).  I'm not going to pass  judgment  on  this  feud  but  it's
certainly tougher on authors now.

  BFIND:  Maintenance release.  Been awhile since it came out and  some  changes
  needed to be made in the documentation.  Dropped the little bat logo from  the
  /? screens.  [Replaces bfind511.zip]

  CHANGE:  Fixed up a bug with the @filelist parameter.  [Replaces chang603.zip]

  CONVERT:  Fixed up some bugs  with  /OUTDEF  not  always  working.   [Replaces
  convr601.zip]

  DIRTOTAL:  Fixed up a bug with some directory totalling.  Dropped  the  little
  bat logo from the /? screens.  [Replaces dirto603.zip]

  EUMAIL:  This program was actually introduced last month but I didn't  add  it
  to BRUCEymm.DOC file since  it  would  have  made  it  too  long.   I  dropped
  ISAMMAKE/ISAMFIND so it fits  now!   Added  /DUMP,  /KILLDUMP,  /HEADERS,  and
  domain parameters which are related to allowing the entire mail  file  or  its
  headers to be dumped as a text file.  Added /REPEAT and /-REPEAT options which
  should be useful for people using FIND or  BFIND  on  the  resulting  nickname
  file.  Expanded most of the name and nickname maximum lengths (folks have some
  really amazing names!).  [Replaces eumal603.zip]

  FORTUNE:  Added /WIPE parameter.  [Replaces fortn510.zip]

  HTMSTRIP:  Added /ALT parameter.  Fixed up a problem where  <BR><BR>  couldn't
  generate blank lines.  More work on <PRE>...</PRE>  blocks.   If  /SYMBOLS  is
  specified, changed default representation for <A> to be  "(link)"  instead  of
  "[Link]", and for <IMG> to be "(image)"  instead  of  "[Image]".   <INPUT>  is
  still "[Input]" though.  Expanded maximum columns per table  from  10  to  15.
  [Replaces htmst603.zip]

  ISAMMAKE/ISAMFIND:  Dropped to make room for EUMAIL.

  TXTABLE:  Expanded maximum  number  of  columns  per  table  from  10  to  20.
  [Replaces txtab603.zip]

Release 96/03:

  CHANGE:  Fixed a bug with /BINARY when you crossed line  boundaries  with  the

BRUCE604.DOC                         7                         Revised: 04/28/96

  change.  [Replaces chang510.zip]

  DIRTOTAL:  Added  some  recovery  handling  for  some  of  the  weirder  Win95
  subdirectory structures.  Modified the  directory  totalling  section  of  the
  output  report  so  longer  directory  names  could   be   shown.    [Replaces
  dirto602.zip]

  EUMAIL:  New program.  Didn't document in BRUCE603.DOC though because I didn't
  have room.  Gets added in 604 version of the documentation.

  FILL:  Added /FORCE option.  Made /LETTER the default.  Fixed up  some  errors
  in the documentation and reduced the  size  of  the  help  display  a  little.
  [Replaced fill602.zip]

  HTMSTRIP:  Added /SITE, /FSITE, and /-SITE options.  Fixed up problem with the
  /RULE=s parameter (didn't work).  [Replaces htmst602.zip]

  READY:  Added /WIDTH=n as a synonym for /n (i.e.  /WIDTH=80,  /WIDTH=132,  and
  /WIDTH=255).  Switched documentation and on-screen help to only reference  the
  /WIDTH=n variations.

  TXTABLE:  Bug fixes.  Added support for <HR> and some  other  things  in  HTML
  mode. Added /RULE=s parameter.  [Replaces txtab602.zip]

Release 96/02:

  AV:  Added help screen (F1) and the ability to Ctrl-PgUp or Ctrl-PgDn  through
  up to 500 archives.  Require Y/N input if press Escape  or  Quit  now.   Added
  colors to the /? help panel.  [Replaces av509.zip]

  DIRTOTAL:  Added sorting by file extension.  [Replaces dirto510.zip]

  FILL:  Added an estimation of the number of diskettes left  to  go  (shows  up
  whenever you're prompted to insert the next diskette).  [Replaces fill601.zip]

  FIXTEXT:  Fixed a problem with switching to/from  CR-LF-CR/LF.   Sigh.   Never
  make changes right before you release something...  Also fixed a bug in  /TEXT
  vs /-TEXT.  Added /EOF and /-EOF.  [Replaces fixtx601.zip]

  HTMSTRIP:  Tables are now handled by the  program.   The  table-handling  code
  from the TXTABLE program was ported over.   Added  parameters:  /BORDER=c  and
  /BUFF=n.   Dropped  parameters:  /TABLES,  /-TABLES,  and  /TAB=n.   [Replaces
  htmst601.zip]

  READ and READMAKE:  Fixed an error that showed up if  you  used  *.INI  files.
  [Replaces read601.zip]

  READY:  Added /FILTER=filename parameter (needed to read some more native word
  processing files and got tired of seeing π and ╙ instead of double  quotes  in
  someone's Mac file.  Added /TEXT option  to  stop  the  program  from  loading
  anything it considered text only (it examines the  first  thousand  bytes  for
  non-ASCII characters).  [Replaces read601.zip]

  TXTABLE:  Internally, was significantly recoded  in  order  for  the  code  to
  portable to the HTMSTRIP command.   Added  the  ability  to  support  imbedded
  pseudo-HTML code as well in addition to the original input format.  The former
  allows you to  have  more  than  one  table  in  the  input  file.   [Replaces
  txtab601.zip]

-------------- (kind of terse; revisions made 4 to 6 months ago)
Release 96/01:

  All routines:  Finally dropped support  for  CONFIGWS.EXE  from  my  programs.
  Changed e-mail addresses.  I'm now at bguthrie@nmaa.org

  CONVERT:  Added cell filters.  Added the ability to  read  Unix  or  Mac  text
  files. Switched default from /TO WKS to /TO FIXED.

  DIRCOMP:  Fixed a bug with /ALL.  Changed  the  default  to  write  no  report
  ("/-F").

  FILL:  Minor change to make /LAST apply to /SPLIT disks as well.

  FILUPDAT:  Added support for *.INI files.

  FIXTEXT:  Added a /BINARY option which lets you strip binary codes from things
  like native WordPerfect files.

  HTMSTRIP:  Removed support for PAGINATE post-processing.

  READ, READMAKE:  Changed program so F3/F9 would find next  line  with  string,
  not necessarily the next  occurence  of  the  string  itself.   Tabs  are  now
  expanded on display.

  READINIT:  Fixed a bug with passing in parms into the routine.

  READY:  Allowed the  program  to  handle  files  with  lines  of  132  or  255
  characters. Added the various horizontal scrolling key options.  Added support
  for binary files including native format word processing files.

  TXTABLE:  New program.

Release 95/12:

  CONVERT:  Now allows you to read fixed-fixed files which contain  lines  which
  do not end with CR/LF.  Dropped SPLITREC.  Now allow the input and output file
  types to be the same; useful if you want to just reformat some existing  data.
  Changed the field-definition file to make the decimal count and output  length
  optional.

  DIRCOMP:  Now allow for up to 10 file exclusions.

  FILL:  Added a message for "last disk of /MULTI set".

  FIXTEXT:  Added automatic detection of  input  text  format  (lines  end  with
  CR/LF, CR alone, or LF alone).

  PAGINATE:  New /Linitfile parameter (allows you to replace characters from the
  input file when you write out the file).

Release 95/11:

  BFIND:  Added /EMPTY and /-EMPTY options.  Program now reads non-DOS files.

  DIRCOMP:  Fixed a bug with the /-F option.


BRUCE604.DOC                         9                         Revised: 04/28/96

  HTMSTRIP:  Added automatic wrapping based on the desired line  length  so  you
  don't have to use PAGINATE.

  READY:  Added /LOAD option.
