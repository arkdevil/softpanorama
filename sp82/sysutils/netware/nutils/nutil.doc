                                       Introduction

                   Here are some general but productive utilities for the
               Network Administrator.  They are all designed for
               interactive/batch use and work with NetWare 2.15 through 2.2
               and NetWare 3.xx.  At time of this release, some testing is
               underway with NetWare 4.00 development code.  These
               utilities have been designed to help ease the network
               administrator in his tasks of maintaining the network.

                   There are at least 50 utilities documented in this
               printable text file.  Most are written using Microsoft C 6.0
               and NetWare C Interface for DOS.  Also, included are some
               sample batch/login scripts that illustrate some uses for the
               utilities.

                   Utilities are described in the following documentation
               along with the errorlevel codes.  Also, using ? as the first
               parameter when executing a utility will generally display
               the syntax options allowed.

                   If you have a utility that you would like to see, then
               please send a suggestion with your registration fee.  If it
               is feasible to create it, then we will.

                                    How To Contact Us


                    In order of preference/speed of us getting it and
               responding:

               1.   MHS Host CLS - (214) 399-8616, - USRobotics HST - Mail
                    to SUPPORT@CLS - available direct, CServe, or NHub.
                    (Direct is fastest!)  Due to financial considerations,
                    namely connect time plus five bucks an hour (boo!),
                    file attachments cannot be sent through CServe at this
                    time.  Messages through CServe and NHub will be picked
                    up and responded to.  Please tell us how to route a
                    message back to you via your preferred route, i.e.,
                    direct connection, NHUB, CServe, etc.

               2.   BBS (The MOCHINE) - (214) 399-8414 - USRobotics Dual
                    Standard - Mail to SYSOP or Marc Nowell - NetMail to
                    1:124/1301 (FidoNet) or 8:930/301 (RBBS-Net).  We read
                    and respond to messages in the NOVELL echo on FidoNet.

               I.   The shareware version of NUtils may be distributed via
                    electronic mail or electronic BBSs and information
                    services as long as the contents of this archive have
                    not been modified.  The shareware distribution set may
                    be distributed by software libraries as long as the
                    compensation is less than $7.50 for the distribution
                    disk.  The shareware software may be included with
                    other packages or publications only with the permission
                    of CLS, which will usually be granted.

               II.  The registered version of NUtils may not be
                    redistributed, and the normal rules of commercial
                    copyrighted software apply.

                                         NADDRESS

               NADDRESS Address
                   To compare Node Address to this station with specified.

               NADDRESS Address /NODE
                   To compare Node Address to this station with specified.

               NADDRESS Address /SEGMENT
                   To compare Segment Address to this station with
                   specified.

               Wildcard character ? can be used in place of an address
               digit, i.e.:  NADDRESS 123? /SEGMENT
                        will match anything with the address of 123?, as in
                        00001230, 00001231, ..., 0000123F

               This utility compares this workstation's Segment or Node
               Address to a specified value.  The primary purpose of this
               utility is to provide a way for batch utilities to be
               executed depending upon the physical address of the
               workstation.  For example, this could be used in cases where
               you want to run a specific program on your print server or
               mail server.  Another use, could be when you need to verify
               that all workstations of a specific NIC manufacturer or on a
               specific segment need new drivers or that the administrator
               needs to be notified.

               Example:
                   In a sample batch file:
                        NADDRESS 864bf8
                        if errorlevel 1 send "Someone logged in on Joe's
                        PC." to SUPERVISOR.
                   Or,
                        NADDRESS 0c5f07 /SEGMENT
                        if errorlevel 1 goto VerifyFrameType
                   Or,
                        NADDRESS 608C????????
                        if not errorlevel 1 goto Skip3c505
                        rem Copy new 3C505.EXE to replace old IPX.COM
                        ncmpdrvr 15 IRQ
                        if errorlevel 1 copy f:\drivers\3c505\irq15\net.cfg
                             c:\net
                        if errorlevel 1 copy f:\drivers\3c505\irq3\net.cfg
                             c:\net
                        :skip3c505

               Returned errorlevels are:

                   9 - drivers not loaded or other error.
                   1 - it matches this workstation.
                   0 - no match found.

               Hint: Workstation Address is displayed when you do a
               USERLIST /A

               This utility will poll all attached workstations for their
               diagnostic packets.  It will display the three workstations
               with the most errors and it will create a ASCII data file
               that has the statistics from all polled workstations.  The
               ASCII data file can be imported by a spreadsheet program.
               Description of diagnostic codes are listed in Table A.

               Returned errorlevels are:

                   9 - Syntax error.
                   8 - User Must be logged in.
                   7 - Unable to access current working subdirectory.
                   4 - Unable to initialize IPX.
                   2 - Unable to open (output) report file.
                   0 - Normal Exit.

                                          NCARD


               NCARD [UserName or Connection Number]

                   NCARD          get stats of current workstation.
                   NCARD BRENDA   get stats at BRENDA's station, or
                   NCARD 34       get stats at Connection # 34.
                                  (specify the Connection # if the user has
                                  not yet logged into the server.)

               This utility will display the results from the diagnostic
               statistics of the specified workstation.  It will only
               display error statistics that are not equal to zero.
               Description of diagnostic codes are listed in Appendix A.


               Returned errorlevels are:

                   9 - Syntax error.
                   8 - User not be logged in.
                   7 - Specified connection is not active.
                   6 - Unable to access info on specified connection.
                   0 - Normal Exit.

                                         NCHGOWN

                 ** Supervisor equivalence needed to run this utility! **


               NCHGOWN Drive:\Subdirectory OldOwnerName NewOwnerName

               This utility will display/change the directory/file
               ownership of the current working directory and all of its
               subdirectories.  Valid owner names consist of Usernames,
               Groupnames and Servernames.

               If parameters are not supplied, it will ask for:

                   OLD OWNER NAME to search for, or NA for deleted owners,
                        or ALL for all owners found in the subdirectories

                   NEW OWNER NAME what will be tagged onto the files

               Sample usages:  Files owned by deleted owners may be "re-
               owned" by valid users; correctly document disk space usage
               by ownership; overcome accounting limitation dealing with
               deleted users; used with NRPTOWN can produce an accurate
               disk space consumption report for administration or
               documentation purposes.

               Example:

               Sample usage:  Modifying all workstations so that they will
               reserve more environment space (needed if your users have a
               lot of SET and/or PATH parameters); ensure that all
               workstations in the field have the needed minimum conditions
               to operate safely on the network; to overrule an individual
               "fooling" with his workstation.

               This utility will check for modems or mice on serial ports.
               If no parameters are specified, modems will be checked for.
               If the M parameter is specified, a mouse will be checked

               NCHKRPRN CHECK
                   Read the (\PUBLIC\NCHKRPRN.LST) file listing to check if
                   the current workstation should be running RPRINTER.  If
                   it is, then report the status of the specified RPRINTER
                   (Not Connected, Change Paper, Ready...).  If a Print
                   JobName exists in the \NCHKRPRN.LST file for the current
                   station, then start a CAPTURE using the specified Print
                   JobName.

               This utility will report the current status of the specified
               printer on the specified print server.  Also, it can warn
               the user that his printer needs attention, and return an
               errorlevel based upon the printer status.  This errorlevel
               will enable the administrator to modify the flow on the
               batch file.

               The following example will check to see if the current
               workstation should be running RPRINTER.  If it should, then
               check the status.  If RPRINTER is NOT CONNECTED (level: 2),
               then  PAUSE  the screen so that the end user can see the
               message.  Otherwise, if it is not that error, then skip to
               the rest of the batch file.

               workstation RPRINTER information.

               Sample usages:  when setup it will warn the end user that he
               needs to take action (Turn ON Printer, Reboot...) for the
               printer that is directly attached to his station, while
               running with RPRINTER.

               This utility will read information from the currently loaded
               workstation shells, and depending on the specified command
               (and result), will return a errorlevel.

               This errorlevel can be used in batch files for executing
               update routines, or just notifying the network administrator
               when the workstation is running a specified driver.

                                         NCOPYIPX


               NCOPYIPX WorkStationDrive:\Path\IPX.COM

               This utility will read the workstation's IPX.COM version and
               configuration information.  It will match this against the
               master on the server, and if the workstation doesn't match,
               it will copy IPX.COM from the server to the workstation.

               New on Sept. 19, 1991:  This utility will read NCOPYIPX.LST
               in the current working subdirectory.  This list file will
               contain workstation LAN option names, and the path name that
               the drivers will be found for the specified driver type.
               So, hence, you CAN separate drivers that are made by the
               same manufacturer and/or different driver types made for the
               same card type.  Read NCOPYIPX.LST for syntax of readable
               text list file.

               This utility can run as a standalone without the
               workstation's network drivers loaded.(if needed)

               Sample usage:  (Easily!) upgrade workstations to different
               IPX versions (IPX.COM).

               The current working subdirectory (that this program is
               called from) must have a structure that is in a

                   PathName \ Interrupt# \ I/O Base \ IPX.COM  order.

               For example:

                   G_ETHERN\IRQ3
                   G_ETHERN\IRQ3\II
                   G_ETHERN\IRQ5\220h
                   G_ETHERN\IRQ5\240h
                   G_ETHERN\IRQ15\240h
                   G_ETHERN\IRQ15\240h\II
                   NETWORTH\IRQ12\240h
                   NETWORTH\IRQ15\240h
                   NETWORTH\IRQ15\240h\II

                        Ethernet II frame IPX files are in II subdirectory.
                        This utility can read the difference between a
                        normal 802.3 and an Ethernet II type frame.  The
                        Ethernet_II framed IPX.COM but be located in the II
                        subdirectory of the interrupt or the IOBase
                        subdirectory.

               If the driver (IPX.COM) does not exist in the I/O Address
               subdirectory, then it will look in the Interrupt


                                      Page 19 of 70





               subdirectory.  (Thus, it will get a NetWorth Irq=15
               IOBase=340h 's IPX.COM from the NETWORTH\IRQ15 subdirectory
               if NETWORTH\IRQ15\340h does not exist.)


                   This utility has been tested on drivers by:
                        3-COM               Thin Wire NICs
                        Networth            10BaseT NICs
                        Gateway             Thin Wire NICs
                        Western Digital     Thin Wire NICs
                        Xircom              10BaseT Adapters

               One of the wonderful things about the 16 bit cards is that
               you can set the cards for higher interrupts than 10 to
               reduce the possibilities of conflict.

               Sample setup:

                   in a batch file is:
                   CD F:\SUPPORT\DRIVERS         change to driver
                                                 subdirectory
                   NCOPYIPX C:\NET\IPX.COM       execute this utility with
                                                 it specifying that the
                                                 workstation drivers are in
                                                 C:\NET subdirectory.

                   The program will first read the manufacturer, IRQ, and
                   I/O Base from the IPX driver.  It will display a message
                   similar to:

                   Workstation Lan Option: Networth ...
                   Path: Networth   Irq: IRQ15   Base: 340h

                   the program will first look in the subdirectory
                   NETWORTH\IRQ15\340H for the IPX.COM file, if it doesn't
                   find it here then it go to the NETWORTH\IRQ15
                   subdirectory.  These subdirectories (NETWORTH\IRQ15,
                   ...) must be found under the current subdirectory (i.e.
                   F:\SUPPORT\DRIVERS in this example) or else a message
                   will be returned that the driver was not found.

               This utility will copy contents of SourceFileName to
               DestFileName, if DestFileName is older than SourceFileName
               or if DestFileName does not exist.  If a ! mark is
               immediately before the source filename prompt, then the
               "copy" operation will occur if the the source and
               destination files are NOT date/time stamped IDENTICALLY.

               This utility is small enough that it may be called (shelled
               to ) by another program.

               Sample usages:  Distribute newer versions of software that
               is used on the workstation; distribute memos, files, and
               other mass distribution.

               Examples:

                   NCOPYNEW F:\APPS\MASTER\BATCH\PHONE.TXT C:\WORD
                        Copies PHONE.TXT if the source copy is newer than
                        the destination.

                   NCOPYNEW !F:\APPS\MASTER\BATCH\PHONE.TXT C:\WORD
                        Copies PHONE.TXT, if the source copy is different
                        than destination.

                   NCOPYNEW F:\APPS\MASTER\BATCH\FILES.* C:\WORD
                        Copies any files matching FILES.* to the
                        subdirectory C:\WORD, if the file is newer than
                        those matching in the destination sub.

               Note! Remember C:AUTOEXEC.BAT is not the same as
               C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT

               NCOPYSCR Drive:\Path\ScriptFile

               This utility is similar to NCOPYNEW except that it reads a
               script file instead of the prompt line.  A sample script
               file is provided.  See the file ALLUSERS.SCR as an example
               script file.

               If the symbol ! is used before the source path\filename in
               the script file, then the utility will copy the file to the
               destination if the date/time stamp is not the same.  If no
               beginning symbol is used, then the normal "copy if outdated"
               rule applies.

               Sample usages:  Distribute newer versions of software that
               is used on the workstation; distribute memos, files, and
               other mass distribution.

               NCPY2SUB Drive:\Path\FileName

               This utility will copy FileName to all existing
               subdirectories of the current default subdirectory.

               Example:
                   When the current subdirectory is \GRP\DOC,
                   NCPY2SUB \USR\SMITH\BLANKMEM.DOC
                   will have the result that BLANKMEM.DOC will be copied to
                        all subdirectories of \GRP\DOC, such as
                        \GRP\DOC\AL, \GRP\DOC\BRENDA, \GRP\DOC\CARL,....

               Sample usages: distribution of configuration/document files
               to individual subdirectories that are below current working
               subdirectory.

               Note: This utility in the past was very useful for it was a
               quick way to copy the PRINTCON.DAT (Print Job Configuration
               file) to all users but now the utility NMANPCON does a much
               better job of this.

               NDATEDIR Drive:\Subdirectory

               This utility will set all files in the current working
               subdirectory (or specified in the command line) to the
               current Date/Time stamp.

               Sample usages:  Marking files that you want to always to be
               archived by the backup software; mark document
               subdirectories with all the same date/time stamp.
               (Especially useful for those important databases that you
               want to ensure that they are completely backed up even
               during incremental backup sessions)

               NDELFILE Drive:\Path FileMask

               This utility will delete all files matching the specified
               FileMask starting at the specified Drive:Path subdirectory
               and all its nested subdirectories.  The FileMask may contain
               wildcard (?,*) characters.

               This utility can be used in a batchfile or interactively.
               If interactive, then typing  NDELFILE, alone will display a
               prompt for the desired subdirectory structure and the
               specified filemask(filename).  If batch, then you will need
               to type the specified Drive:\Path and FileMask in the
               command line when executing NDELFILE.

               Warning!  This utility will not verify if the file should or
               should not be deleted, it will simply do what you told it!

               Sample usages:  Delete those .BAK and other backup files
               that are left by user programs to save diskspace; run this
               process after doing a full backup of the server; run this
               process if a maintenance robot (ei. NDISK.EXE) finds that
               diskspace is very low.

               NDELPRNJ QueueName UserName

               This utility will delete all Print Jobs created by UserName.
               The user executing this utility must have sufficient rights
               to delete print jobs.  If only the QueueName is specified,
               then all Print Jobs that the user has security rights can be
               deleted for the specified queue.  If the QueueName and
               UserName is specified, then all Print Jobs for the specified
               Queue and UserName are deleted.

               Sample usages:  Allow users delete their active print jobs
               by selecting an option in your menuing system;  Delete all
               hung (out of paper, printer offLine, ...) print jobs so that
               the backup machine (usually after midnight) may backup the
               file server without waiting forever on the queue files to
               close (Thus, also backing up the queue directory
               structures).

               The purpose of this utility so that you can get an overview
               of the status of the file servers on your network.  It will
               display the names, NetWare version, and network address of
               all servers.  It will also give a summary of the connections
               in use for those servers that you are logged in.  This very
               useful if you have any Hewlett Packard Network Interface
               cards or Castelle Print Server equipment becuase it will
               display connections that have defined in PCONSOLE but are
               not online.

               For example, when the utility executes, it sees that you
               have defined four print servers on a (logged on) file
               server.  It will check to see if those four print servers
               are attached to the file server, if they are not, it will
               display the print server's name on the screen.

               Also, if you configure special access users (like
               Supervisor, MHS, FAX, Super, Tape...), with a FullName that
               starts with a - (minus sign), then NLIST will display these
               user names if they are logged in.  (This is handy to check
               and see if your special accounts are currently operational.)

               NLOGADDR Drive:Path\FileName [/N]

               /N is optional command that will ask the user to type in a
               30 character description of this workstation.

               This utility will get physical address of the workstation
               and insert this information into the database specified by
               FileName.

               Sample usages:  Track login usage at the workstation level;
               trace program usage by physical station; trace previous
               logins at work station; track usage of work stations; track
               workstation conditions, allows a network administrator a
               quick way to find who had been accessing a program by a
               specific workstation.

               Example placed in a batch file:

                   NDISK C:
                   IF ERRORLEVEL 2 NLOGADDR F:\WARNINGS\LOWDISK.LST
                   IF C:\WP\WP.EXE NLOGADDR F:\INVENT\WPUSER.TXT

               The database file is in a fixed format (CR/LF) text file, so
               the administrator can do searches/lookup using any text
               editor.

               Command choices:

                   B    Begin Date/Time Event for workstation (log to
                        specified data file)

                   E    End Date/Time Event for current workstation (log to
                        specified data file)

                   R    Create user (summary and sorted) usage report for
                        specified data file.

               This utility will track usage of events.  These events could
               range anywhere from keeping track of user login time to
               application utilization.  The data will be kept in the
               specified data file (random-access fixed-field text file).
               This raw file can be viewed or printed by the network
               administrator.

               For example, you may want to keep track of who and how often
               end users will execute a specific application.  In this case
               you would begin the event (i.e., NLOGEVT B APP1) before you
               execute the application.  Then, in your batch file, you
               would end the event (i.e., NLOGEVT E APP1) after you have
               finished the application.  Later, when you view (or do a
               report) on the specified log file (NLOGEVT R APP1), you
               would see some usage stats on the user,
               such as:

               Address       Physical Address that the enduser was at when
                             the application was run.

               LoginName     LoginName of the user that accessed the
                             specified event.

               StartDate     Start date of the event for the displayed
                             loginname and station.

               StartTime     Start time of the event for the displayed
                             loginname and station.

               EndDate       End date of the event for the displayed
                             loginname and station.

               EndTime       End time of the event for the displayed
                             loginname and station.

               Abends        Number of times that the enduser rebooted or
                             otherwise did not end event (NLOG E APPNAME)
                             after running the application.  Or, in other
                             words, the number of times that the utility
                             was told to begin an event that already had
                             started.

               Event Count   Number of times that an event occurred, or the

               NLOGMSG Drive:Pathname\FileName MessageString [/P] [/S]

               This utility is normally used in batch files, to record(log)
               an event or error that has taken place.  The user provides a
               file name and a message.  The 'message' will be appended to
               the end of the log file named, along with the Login name,
               date, and time of the event.  If the optional /P is
               specified, the physical node address of the station will be
               added to the line.  If the optional /S is specified, the
               server name will be added to the data file listing as well.

               NMANPCON [UserName or GroupName]

               NMANPCON BRENDA    Create new printer configuration file for
                                  user BRENDA.

               NMANPCON EVERYONE  Create a new printer configuration file
                                  for all users that are a member of group
                                  EVERYONE.

               This utility will first copy the Supervisor's PRINTCON.DAT
               to specified users, and then for each user, it will remove
               job configurations that the individual user does not have
               sufficient security to access, i.e., not a member of queue
               user

               So, if you are using this with the utility NSELPRNJ, you
               never have to explain about printer job names that the users
               don't have access to, because they simply aren't displayed!

               Also, this will enable you to not worry about going through
               the PRINTCON routine for all your users whenever a new
               jobname, printer, or other changes are required.  Now, just
               set up the supervisor's PRINTCON configuration the way you
               like it, and then run this utility.  All users will then
               have a correct printcon file.

               You would need to only run this utility if:

                   Modified the supervisor's PRINTCON.DAT file and want it
                   to effect other users.
                   If it only effects a specific group, do:
                        NMANPCON GroupName
                   If it effects everyone, then do:
                        NMANPCON EVERYONE

                   Added a new user, and so you want to create the user's
                   PRINTCON.DAT configuration from the master copy.
                        NMANPCON NewUserName
                        and that's it!

               Sample usages:  Make maintaining PRINTCON.DAT files a breeze
               because you only have to maintain on master copy; used in
               conjunction with NSELPRNJ makes an easier to use and
               maintain printer system; run this utility after creating new
               users will then result in a PRINTCON.DAT file correctly
               configured for those users.

               NMEM

               This small utility will report amount of conventional memory
               available to programs.  It will return an errorlevel by 10K
               increments.  For example, if NMEM detects that 250K is
               available then it will return an errorlevel of 25.

               Sample usages:  Insert before a application call in a batch
               file, and if there isn't enough memory available, then goto
               the appropriate message in the batch file.

               Returned errorlevels:

                                         NMHS2TXT


               NMHS2TXT.EXE must be renamed to OUTPOST.EXE when it is
               copied to the defined gateway's PUBLIC subdirectory.

               MHS will execute this utility when it sends Email to the
               Gateway's OUT sub,and convert the email message to a (word
               wrapped) text file called OUTPOST.TXT in
               \MHS\MAIL\GATES\(GatewayName)\OUT subdirectory.  Then the
               utility will shell and execute the NMHS2TXT.BAT file that
               you have created in the \MHS\MAIL\GATES\(GatewayName)\PUBLIC
               subdirectory.

               Sample usage:  Useful in multiple MHS locations when
               automatically transfering text files on a routine basis.

               For example:  An MHS location creates a daily company report
               and is emailed to all member MHS sites.  At the receiving
               site, the mail message will be converted to a text file and
               placed in a common subdirectory for all to access.  (This is
               good for several reasons: 1 - can be done automatically at
               any frequency or time of day, 2 - reduces hard disk space
               needed to store one document instead of multiple email
               messages....)


               To install:

                   Create a new gateway in MHS's Directory Manager section.
                   Note: Do not create a Gateway command.

                   Add the gateway name to 'User Routes' in MHS's Directory
                   Manager.

                   COPY  NMHS2TXT.EXE  to
                   \mhs\mail\gates\(GatewayName)\public\OUTPOST.EXE

                        Note: Yes, it should be called OUTPOST.EXE in this
                        subdirectory.

                   Create a NMHS2TXT.BAT in 
                   \MHS\MAIL\GATES\(GatewayName)\PUBLIC

                        This batch could copy the file to the desired
                        location or other things.
                        Note: FileName NMHS2TXT.EXE must not exist in this
                        same PUBLIC sub.
                        A sample can be found in the SAMPLES.LZH file.

                   Now, whenever you send a message to GateWayName @
                   GateWayName, the utility will make it a text file and
                   manipulate it.

                   NOPNFILE                 will search the current
                                            directory for any open files.

               This utility will display the files that are open and
               current access levels.

               NRPTBIND Objectname [Switch]

               If Objectname is a User, then a User Report is created,
                   switch parameter is ignored.
                   i.e., NRPTBIND BONNIE
                   for a User Report on user  BONNIE

               If Objectname is a Group, then the below choices are allowed
                        for the switch:
                   D    Create a comma ASCII file on user info
                   M    Create MHSREMOTE.BAT & MHSLOCAL.BAT files
                   N    Create report for specified group
                   S    Display status on all members of group
                   Y    Create report for all members of group

               If Objectname is a Queue, then a Queue Report is created,
                   switch is ignored.
                   i.e., NRPTBIND HP-QUEUE
                   for a queue report on queuename HP-QUEUE.

               If Objectname is a PrintServer, then a PrintServer Report is
               created, switch parameter is ignored.
                   i.e., NRPTBIND TRITON-P
                   for a PrintServer Report about PrintServer named TRITON-
                                  P

               This utility will create a report for individual users,
               groups, print queues, and print servers depending on the
               specified command.

               If it is a User Report, then it will contain  Account
               Information, Direct Trustee Assignments, Group Members,
               Security Equivalences, and Queue Membership.

               If it is a Group Report, then it will only contain Direct
               Trustee Assignments, Group Members and Queue Membership.

                   The D option is to create a comma-delimited ASCII file
                   on user login and security information of the specified
                   users.  The file can be imported into Lotus 123 or other
                   spreadsheet packages.

                   The M option is to create a MHSREMOTE.BAT and
                   MHSLOCAL.BAT file that you can run on your local MHS
                   host and other MHS hosts to create an accurate routing
                   table for your MHS sites.

                        For example, currently if you create a Netware
                        user, you would need to manually enter the user as
                        a 'User at this Host' on your local MHS system, and
                        add them to 'Users Routes' on your other MHS hosts.
                        Well, now, you can use the above batch files that
                        will use MHS's own utility (MHSUSER) to maintain
                        accurate routing information for your MHS hosts.

                        MHSLOCAL.BAT is ran on the same MHS host server
                        that you ran the NRPTBIND utility on, for it
                        creates an accurate 'Users at this Host' routing
                        table for MHS.

                        MHSREMOTE.BAT is ran on other MHS host servers than
                        you ran the NRPTBIND utility on, for it creates an
                        accurate 'User Routes' routing info for MHS.

                   The S option is to display a 'quick' status of
                   'important' login and security information of the
                   specified users.

               If it is a Queue Report, then it will contain a Queue
               Subdirectory, Queue Servers, Queue Operators and Queue
               Users.

               If it is a PrintServer Report, then it will contain a list
               of the PrintServer's operators and users.  Configurations
               for all configured printers, with its defined queue and
               notify settings.

               Note: You must a supervisor equivalent to run this report,
               or else it will only let you run a report on yourself.

               Sample usages:  Document newly created users/groups/queues,
               check status on user access, document your LAN, avoid the
               trouble of needing to print-screen your settings, import
               your user configuration into spreadsheets/databases for
               comparison and storage.

               This utility will create a quick report text file on the
               settings of the MHS NETDIR.TAB file.  The configuration info
               will be sent to a file called  MHSHostname.MHS, where
               MHSHostname is replaced by the name of your MHS host.  This
               info will include basic host configuration, and a sorted
               list of all local and remote users defined at this host.

               Also, a REMOTE.REM file will be created that has a file
               format matching a RightHandMan compatible REMOTE.REM file.
               This is to aid the adminsitrator maintain a list of 'Remote
               User's for all 'remote' locations that call a central mail
               hub.

               This utility was created so that the network administrator
               can keep track of message traffic and disk space consumption
               of MHS mail messages.  Especially, since a message can take
               4K bytes (or more!) of disk space, it doesn't take many to
               result in a disk space full message on smaller volumes.

               Sample usage is:  NRPTMHSU H:\MHS\MAIL\USERS

               Output will consist of:

               Setup instructions:

               Add the 'Default Printer Routing' as a menu item in your
                        standard user menu, have it execute NSELPRNJ.

                        Add  NSELPRNJ SET   to your system login script.

                        Inform users that they can setup their default
                        printer routing by choosing this utility in your
                        menu program.  (Also, remind them that they can
                        change these options at anytime.)

                        routings are automatically activated.

               Sample usages:  administrator no longer has to maintain a
               personal login script or other manual settings for the
               enduser; with this, if the enduser is smart enough to pick
               from a menu, then he can maintain his own printer routing
               needs!  Frees administrator from maintaining the users
               printer routing through personal login scripts.

               NSUBOWN Drive:\Pathname

               This utility will display/change the file ownership of all
               subdirectories below it using the name of the immediate
               subdirectories at execution.

               For instance:

                   Currently at  H:\USR, and when using DIR, it will
                   display:
                        ALVIN <Subdirectory>
                        BETTY <Subdirectory>
                        DENNIS <Subdirectory>
                        MiscFile <some files...>

                   Execute this utility by  NSUBOWN  [return]

                   The utility check if ALVIN is a valid owner name, if it
                   is then it will set ALVIN's subdirectory (and all
                   further below) to the owner set to ALVIN.

                   Then, it will check if BETTY is a valid owner name, if
                   it is then it will set BETTY has being the owner of
                   BETTY subdirectory (and all further below).

                   It will do this to DENNIS also.  But, if DENNIS does not
                   exist as an Owner, then it will display Does Not Exist,
                   and skip to the next subdirectory.

               Sample usages:  If this is done to the personal
               subdirectories it will give a more accurate consumption of
               disk space when using the NRPTOWN utility; setting files to
               their correct owner(LoginName, Group, Server) will make them
               easier to administer.

               This utility will first display the top ten workstations
               with the most packets sent/received and error stats, then
               display the top five most active workstations every ten
               seconds.  The top five most active list will cycle for five
               minutes or until a keystroke is pressed.

               Sample usages:  Find the most active workstations;  find a
               workstation that has an application "babbling" on the wire.

               Returned errorlevels:

                   9 - Syntax error.
                   8 - Must be logged in.
                   7 - Unable to access current subdirectory.
                   6 - Specified group does not exist.
                   2 - Error writing report file.

               This program will return the amount of XMS memory available.
               (Microsoft's HIMEM.SYS is a XMS memory driver).  It will
               return the amount 10K increments as an Errorlevel.  For
               example, if NXMSMEM found 2304K available, then it will
               return with an errorlevel of 230.  The maximum errorlevel
               returned is 255.

               Sample usages:  Insert before a application call in a batch
               file, and if there isn't enough memory available, then goto
               the appropriate message in the batch file; if there is
               enough XMS memory then load the protected version of the
               application instead of the real mode version; avoid the
               maintenance headache of keeping multiple AUTOEXEC.BAT and
               CONFIG.SYS files for different machines.

               For example:

                   Use it to load the XMSNETX instead of the NETx shell.

                        NXMSMEM
                        if errorlevel 7 XMSNETX
                        NETX

                   Use it load the appropiate version of Informix
               SmartWare.

                        NXMSMEM
                        if errorlevel 96 goto ProtMode
                        SMART %1 %2
                        goto Next
                        echo Loading in Protected Mode
                        :ProtMode
                        echo Loading in Protected Mode
                        SMARTP %1 %2
                        :Next

               Returned errorlevels:

                   XXX - Number of megabytes of free XMS memory.
