New/Changed in release 7.   (Since last official unregistered release.)

NRPTSUB  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
         New utility to report disk consumption by subdirectory name and
         file extension.  Information can be exported to a text file
         that then can be imported by spreadsheet programs or databases.
         The text file format keeps track of the previous executions of the
         program so to help plan disk consumption for the future needs.
         Use NRPTSUB /? for option listing.

NQUOTES
         New utility to display a single (random based on current date/time)
         quote from a specified text file.

NEXPIRE
         New utility that will return as an ErrorLevel (for batch files) the
         number of days before the current (or specified) user's password
         will expire.  Excellent for those users that you want to warn 
         days before their password really expires.

NINVENT
         New utility to help keep track of your workstations.
         It can append information such as Conventional Memory Avail,
         EMS Available, Disk Space Available, LanCard Name, and other
         such information into a ASCII Comma-delimited file that you
         can search on.
         You may find it quite handy to keep track of available space
         on the workstations so that you can visit the user before
         he has out-of-space problems!

NCHKMODM
         New utility to search for modems on the client's workstation.  
         Probably the best use is when start at a company with several
         hundred workstations and the database is not so hot on who all
         have Modems installed.   Utility will return an errorlevel if
         a modem is found.

NOPNFILE
         Can report some information on open files on Netware 386 3.11
         servers.  But, this requires a user to the have File Console
         Operator status, which means that they can change server's
         date/time, disable logins, and down the server.  So, it advisable
         to continue using the WHO386 and other utilities that report
         this information without the user needing the Console Operator
         status.

NDELFILE
         Handles deeper subdirectory structures.(paths)

NMANPCON
         Fix bug in use of its lowercase print jobnames.
         Will automatically create a printjob name matching queuename 
         if the a printjob is not created for that queue.  The new
         jobname is created for the receiptent user when the utility
         is ran.  The new jobname uses the job configuration from the
         'default' jobname.
         (basically, a way to allow to have more than 37 jobnames and
         also a method so you do not have to create a jobname for every
         queue.)

NADDRESS
         Compare the workstation's segment address in addition to the
         physical station address.  Wildcards are also accepted.

NALLCARD
         The NALLCARD.TXT has been split into multiple filenames to ease the
         task of importing the numbers into a spreadsheet application.
           NALLCARD.TXT   -  Header Information and Totals.
           NALLCARD.001   -  Information for connections  1 to  9.
           NALLCARD.002   -  Information for connections 10 to 19.
           NALLCARD.003   -  Information for connections 20 to 29.
           ...

NCOPYNEW
         Wildcards accepted for source address.  Can compare/copy all 
         files matching the wildcards.

NRPTBIND
         New: Create an importable textfile detailing security info by user.
           You can import the information into a spreadsheet program.
           Then, you can sort and manipulate to find unused accounts,
           expired accounts, active accounts, and in general helps you
           to maintain an accurate userlist profile on each server.
         New: Create two batch files useful in synchronizing MHS Hosts.
           Most usefull, if you have a routing MHS 1.5 host controlling
           other non-routing hosts on an internetwork.

         Updated utility to report on a few more items that can be found
         in the MHS (Novell's Message Handling System) routing file.

NRPTOWN  
         Report of disk space consumed by object name (username).

ULIST
         ULIST was written by Robert Carroll.  
         This program is similar to Novell's USERLIST.EXE, but with more
         options.   He sent this to me, asking that I expand on the
         concept.  Unfortunitely, I haven't yet.  But, I have enclosed
         his program with this release.
         If this utility has helped you in the administration of your 
         network, please thank Robert directly!
         Options for ULIST are:  (also displayed by a ULIST ?)

            A    - Sorted by NIC Adapter Address.
            C    - Unsorted, Listed by station number.
            D      Sorted by login Date.
            N    - Sorted by Network Number.
            L    - Sorted Alphabetically by Login Name.(Default)
            T    - Sort by login time.

            R    - Repeat every 3604 seconds until a key is pressed.
            F    - Write to file 'USERLIST.00x'

           If the Repeat mode is active, Write to file will cycle thru .000 
           to .009 and will overwrite existing files if they exist.
