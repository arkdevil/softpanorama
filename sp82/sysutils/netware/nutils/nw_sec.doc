NW_SEC.EXE documentation
May 5, 1993

NW_SEC is a program written to scan the bindery of a NetWare server to 
check for several of the situations that are discouraged by a standard
corporation's Security Guidelines.

The person running this utility must be Supervisor or Supervisor 
equivalent.  If not, the program will terminate with an appropriate 
message.

To scan for a particular user, print server, or user group, enter 
"NW_SEC <name>", where name is the name of the user in question.  To
scan ALL objects on a server, enter "NW_SEC *".  This global scan will
also write data to the end of a file called NW_SEC.LOG in the current
working directory.

Each scanned object will be represented by a line similar to the 
following:

+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|DALEPUS003  /MANOWELL             [ac000162] U Marc A. Nowell           |
|[              ]     0                                                  |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The first item is the name of the server being scanned, the second item is
the name of the scanned object.  The next item is an eight-byte hex ID that
represents the NetWare object identification, the fourth item is a "U", "G",
or "P" to signify a User, Group, or Print Server.  The fifth item is the
full name of the object, or "n/a" if none is present.  The next item is a 
set of flags that indicate "hits" against the security guidelines, as 
keyed by the list at the end of this document.  The last item is the number
of days since the object has last logged in.

Note that the screen display will appear as above on two lines, disk output
will be on a single long line to allow for easy sorting and printing.
