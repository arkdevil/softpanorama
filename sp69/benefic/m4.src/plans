Future ideas and plans for GNU m4.     -*- text -*-

If you have any comments on these things, or just good ideas of your own, I
would very much like to hear about them.



Include file path search
========================

The ability for search through a user specified search path for files
mentioned in `include' and `sinclude' calls would be useful, especially if you
tend to build up libraries for useful macros, for common use.

The implementation would use an environment variable, M4PATH, and an `-Idir'
command line option.  The search path for an included file would then be:
first the directories mentioned on the command line, then the directories from
the colon separated list in M4PATH, and last the current working directory.

If there are no -I options, and M4PATH is not set, the behaviour is as it has
always been.



A new `format' builtin
======================

This will support printf-like formatting capabilities, which will be useful
when making (semi-)tabular output.  The syntax will be

	format(fmt, arg1, arg2, ...)

where `fmt' can contain `%' specifications, with field widths and precisions
as usual.  The expansion will be the formatted string.



A new `regexp' builtin
======================

This will support matching regular expressions in m4.  I imagine a syntax with
two or three arguments.  If called with two arguments, 

	regexp(regular expression, string)

`regexp' will expand to either `0' or `1', depending on whether `string'
matches the regular expression.  Called with three arguments, it is possible
to control the expansion.

	regexp(regular expression, string, substitution)

Here the expansion is `substitution' with `\digit' and `\&' sequences
substituted as usual.



Shorthands in translit
======================

The `translit' builtin should support shorthands, like tr(1) does.  This might
be implementated in a future version of GNU m4.
