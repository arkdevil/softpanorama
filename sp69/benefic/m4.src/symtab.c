/* 
 * This file handles all the low level work around the symbol table.
 * The symbol table is a simple chained hash table.  Each symbol is
 * desribed by a struct symbol, which is placed in the hash table based
 * upon the symbol name.  Symbols that hash to the same entry in the
 * table are kept on a list, sorted by name.  As a special case, to
 * facilitate the "pushdef" and "popdef" builtins, a symbol can be
 * several times in the symbol table, one for each definition.  Since
 * the name is the same, all the entries for the symbol will be on the
 * same list, and will also, because the list is sorted, be adjacent.
 * All the entries for a name are simply ordered on the list by age.
 * The current definition will then always be the first found.
