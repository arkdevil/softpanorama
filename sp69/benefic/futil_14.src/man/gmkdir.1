.B mkdir
creates a directory with each given name.  By default, the mode of
created directories is 0777 minus the bits set in the umask.
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-m, +mode mode
Set the mode of created directories to
.IR mode ,
which is symbolic as in chmod and uses the default mode as a point of
departure.
.TP
.I \-p, +path
Ensure that each given path exists.  Make any missing parent
directories for each argument.  Parent directories default to the
umask modified by `u+wx'.  Do not consider an argument directory that
already exists to be an error.
