
There are 4 programs that expose the FDIV bug in various ways.  In
order of the speed they report the bug:
	havebug.c	Instant, uses a special known seed to trigger bug
	fdiv.c		1 or so a second for 40 seconds, uses a biased
				random number generator
	linsearchbug.c	linear search once every 20 minutes on a p-90
	rndsearch.c	random once an hour or so on a p-90
	p87test.zip	Source/binary for a pc test, reports chipid/step
				number, as well as fdiv test.
	*.explain	Posts from comp.sys.intel I thought were particularly 
				informative

Basically they all expose the FDIV bug which is basically returning
single precision silently when your expecting double precision.

If you have any questions email broadley@math.ucdavis.edu

Please email if your pentium does NOT have the bug, preferable with:
	Chipid/step #, Vendor you purchased from, Which Mhz chip it is,
	and date of purchase.

Excerpts from the *Intel Pentium Family User's Manual, Volume 3*

Chapter 6, "Numeric Applications"

"The Pentium processor FPU has been completely redesigned over the
Intel486 processor FPU while maintaining conformance to both the IEEE
Std 754 and 854."

"The 32-bit Intel architectures...are explicitly designed to deliver
stable, accurate results when programmed using straightforward
'pencil and paper' algorithms, bringing the functionality and power
of accurate numeric computation into the hands of the general user."

"General application programmers using straightforward algorithms
will produce much more reliable programs using the Intel
architectures.  This simple fact greatly reduces the software
investment required to develop safe, accurate computation-based
products."

"...Intel architectures have built-in facilities for commercial
computing.  They can process decimal numbers of up to 18 digits
without round-off errors, performing *exact arithmetic* [italicized
in original text] on integers as large as 2^64 or 10^18.  Exact
arithmetic is vital in accounting applications where rounding errors
may introduce monitary losses that cannot be reconciled."

But, across from the table of contents:

"Intel Corporation makes no warranty for the use of its products and
assumes no responsibility for any errors which may appear in this
document nor does it make a commitment to update the information
contained herein.  Intel retains the right to make changes to these
