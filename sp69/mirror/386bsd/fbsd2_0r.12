Ok, ok, I give!  I cry uncle!

Bowing to somewhat intense popular demand, I've made a 1.2MB boot floppy
available in:

	 ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/2.0-RELEASE/floppies/boot_12.flp

(in the obvious place next to the others).

It contains the README and TROUBLESHOOTING guides, but precious little
else in the way of opening-screen docs.  1.2MB floppy users will just have
to read the INSTALL doc and muddle through as best they can!  In reality,
I don't actually think that this will constitute much of a problem.  That
is the only change between the 1.44MB and 1.2MB versions.  The cpio.flp
image can be used normally on either type of drive.

Anyway, at least you folks can now install...  Oh, and folks, I seriously
suggest that you BUY new 1.44MB drives at some point, ok? :-)
