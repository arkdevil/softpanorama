Subject: [FreeBSD] Problem doing network installation

I'm in the process (once again) of attempting to install FreeBSD on my 
office PC.  It now sees my network card (3Com 3c509) finally--yeah!

However, when I attempt to do the FTP installation it dies claiming that 
it can't find the checksum script (I downloaded the install floppies I'm 
using maybe an hour ago).  I dropped to a shell to try and ftp everything 
manually.  I checked the network setup and everything looked dandy, but 
it can't seem to find the network.  Can't resolve domain names or IP 
addresses.  ifconfig -a gives me  an error:

ifconfig: ioctl (SIOCGFFLAGS): no such interface

While the main reason I want to run a BSD system is to learn from irt, 
since this is my work machine it has to have a working net connection 
from the start or else I can;t use it at all and will have to switch back 
to Linux again (Linux-users--don't comment please).  Anyone know what the 
problem is?
