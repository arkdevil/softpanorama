That's no problem.  Actually, the changes from ALPHA->RELEASE were very
small, most of our work going into improving the installation utilities
(how good a job we did of that I'll let you folks decide).  We fixed some
bugs in the de0 driver, and a couple of miscellaneous fixes when into
curses and syscons, but not enough to get really worried about.  If you're
happily running ALPHA, continue to be happy! :-)

This will be forthcoming.  They're just delayed for a short time while
everyone involved catches up on a few days of much needed sleep! :-)
