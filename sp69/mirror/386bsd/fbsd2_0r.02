I noticed that 2.0 RELEASE is now available.  Having just upgraded from
1.1.5.1 RELEASE to 2.0 ALPHA, I have no desire to go through another
complete reinstall.  I'd like to just compile a new kernel and recompile
the source tree and install binaries.

Is this a possibility?

I also didn't see a diff file for ALPHA-RELEASE.  Is there any
particular reason for this?  It'd sure be nice to grab just the diffs
rather than a complete source tree.
