Most likely your media type is different than the default for the
ep0 driver.  Try running 3c5x9cfg and setting the correct media.
You may need to plug in the default port, i.e. use AUI instead of UTP.
I'm not sure what the default for FreeBSD's 3c5x9 driver is.  On
NetBSD you can use a "link" option on the ifconfig line, but I'm not
sure about FreeBSD.

I'm not picking on you, as I see this often,  but this is really a flamebait
comment.  It comes across as a threat... "Make my machine work, or I'll
use Linux".  In my opinion, many people would respond to this with a
comment along the lines of "Then use Linux and STFU."  The "Or Else"
type comment rubs everybody the wrong way.

If you feel like you just have to mention that Linux runs correctly
on your hardware, but XXX OS doesn't, say something like this:
"I know the hardware is working, as DOS, Netware, and Linux all work"

And nope, I don't speak for anybody but myself... :-)
And yeah, I probably should drink less Mt. Dew...
