Hmmm...the system messages at bootup showed it seeing the media setting 
as being UTP (which is what it is--I had set it on the card with the 
3c5x9.cfg program when I installed it).

Sorry--what I meant by this was that it gets very time consuming having 
to continually reinstall the OS on the machine when something doesn't 
work out because I need the machine to be up and running during the day.

Heh.  OK--well, the hardware works fine with Chameleon under Windows and 
worked right off the bat when I installed Linux.  

Ack--gets closer every time I try installing but still no dice.  Any help 
would be greatly appreciated.
