Yes, I blew it here.  You can do it by hand by essentially copying
all the bindist files onto floppies, and then doing this from a
subshell:

0. mkdir /usr/tmp
1. mount_msdos -r /dev/fd0a /mnt
2. cp /mnt/* /usr/tmp
3. umount /mnt
4. goto 1 [until done]
5. cd /usr/tmp
6. sh ./extract.sh

Sorry for the screwup, this will be fixed in 2.1.

Another oversight.  I forgot we even supported this card! :-)
Also fixed in 2.1.
