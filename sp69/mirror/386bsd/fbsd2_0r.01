This seems to come up quite a bit, so just to clarify:

1. The boot.flp and cpio.flp images should be written *directly* to disk.
   Yes, we know that cpio.flp is gzip'd but doesn't end in .gz.  This
   intentional, as we DON'T want you to ungzip it!  The install does this
   itself.

2. Yes, that boot.flp is a 1.44MB floppy, not a 1.2MB floppy.  Due to
   ever-increasing space demands, we couldn't fit 2.0R onto a 1.2MB
   floppy.

   For 2.1, we'll probably have a 3 floppy set for 1.2MB floppy people,
   but unless someone does this as a home-brew project (which I'd enourage),
   it will NOT happen for 2.0R from any of us.  We're too busy working
   on other problems right now to even think about revisiting this
   issue, sorry!

I know that this puts 1.2Mb users in a bit of a bind, but the clock
simply ran out on us here and we had no more time to try and think of
clever solutions for compacting the boot floppy any further.
