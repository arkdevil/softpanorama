Loading distributions from a 1.1.5.1 disk doesn't work.  It acts
like it is going to work, but then doesn't do anything.

Also, loading a second distribution miscalculates the directory.
For example if you are loading from /mnt/fum/foo/bindist, it
calculates /mnt/fum/foo/bindist/manpages instead of 
/mnt/fum/foo/manpages.

Also, the first time through it assumes bindist *even* if you are loading
manpages...

Finally, fscking your 1.1.5.1 disk from 2.0 is a *BAD IDEA*.  You guys
probably already knew that, but I didn't.

I ended up using extract.sh, but that produced ``strange'' results,
as in bindist seeming to be loaded twice (although it *did* get loaded).

Any chance there is a fix for any of this?
