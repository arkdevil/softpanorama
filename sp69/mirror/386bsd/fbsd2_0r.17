Well, I can't get my 3c509 working right either..  Installed 2.0R
last night.  The ep0 probe shows something like: [aui/*UTP*] so I
am assuming its talking to the utp port.  I tried everything I
suggested.. :-)  I noticed the "link status" light on my hub going on
and off as I tried to use the ethernet.  I guess I'll have to try
the ifconfig ep0 aui (or utp) command.

As a side note, 2 things:
	1st, I have to power off the machine between boots or it
	will not detect the 3c509. (I checked for conflicts - none)

	2nd, I have a similar problem with NetBSD 1.0 using the AUI port
	(i.e. the link status on and off), but the UTP port works fine.
	I don't know, but I think the ep0 driver is weirding on my card.
	It's a standard 3c509TP, i.e. AUI/UTP with no BNC (not combo)

So... I guess I have the same problems with the ep0 as the original
poster, guess I should've kept my mouth shut. :-)

I'll try 'ifconfig ep0 x.x.x.x utp' and see if it helps out.
