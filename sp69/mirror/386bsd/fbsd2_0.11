If I don't miss my guess, you've got FreeBSD trying to install at a
cylinder >1024.  As I noted in the TROUBLESHOOTING guide on the first
boot floppy (uh, are people reading that? :-), PC hardware simply
won't allow such things to happen with its paltry little 10 bit
cylinder address.

You need to enable cylinder translation with this configuration.

The bad news is that you probably also need to re-install DOS to do
so, if you happened to install DOS without this enabled in the BIOS.
Nonetheless, give it a shot and see if DOS is happy with geometry
translation turned on, then try to find out what the translated
head/sect values are and plug these into FreeBSD's "(G)eometry"
command when you re-install it.
