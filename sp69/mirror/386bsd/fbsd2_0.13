I saw a similar problem installing NetBSD 1.0 on a friends machine.  The system
would come up with "No operating system" if you selected the NetBSD
partition from the OS/BS menu.

The fix was to get pfdisk for DOS and rewrite the partition table so that it
had the same starting blocks and lengths for each partitions (basically forcing
it to rewrite the partition table).  It looks like using MS-DOS 5 fdisk had
written invalid c/h/s values for the partitions (or it could have been 
the fdisk that comes with NetBSD) but had written valid sector number values
(or c/h/s values that computed to the same thing).
