First problems with FreeBSD-2.0-RELEASE:

	* Load from DOS Floppy does not seem to work properly,
	  it seems I must have all the files in a subdirectory
	  called "bindist" on the floppy, any attempt to get it to
	  read it from the root directory of the floppy fails because
	  "bindist' is added to the path.  Also it does not ask to swap
	  floppies.  It just gives me error like "file  not found" doing
	  the checksum's when it should ask for the next disk.

	* Kernel has support for 'le0' (DEC Etherworks xx) but the
	  option to ftp does not have setup support for the card.


Other than these two items, the release seems to be very *user friendly*,
so far as installation goes.  Has anyone else noticed this?  or am I just
lucky enough to get the problem.   

I am installing on my "test" machine first to get the hang of the changes.

My Equip:

	486dx2-66
	4MB RAM
	160MB HD

Any ideas appreciated...
