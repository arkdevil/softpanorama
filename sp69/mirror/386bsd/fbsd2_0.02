Great job, really. I'm almost totally satisfied with my 2.0 system, there
are only a couple of minor quirks left but I intend to straighten them 
out myself :-).

If anyone in the core team ever feels that he (there isn't any she's, is
there??), needs a pat on the back I'm quite sure there will be a long line 
of users ready to do the patting... ;-)


Cheers,
	Paul.
