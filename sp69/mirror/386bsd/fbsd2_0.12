   If I don't miss my guess, you've got FreeBSD trying to install at a

I noticed that bit.  But (F)disk says my FreeBSD slice starts at
cylinder 876 and extends all the way to cylinder 2100.  That should be
OK, right?

And here's another datapoint for you: if I boot from the boot floppy
and then at the boot prompt type hd(0,a)/kernel, it boots fine and I
can continue to install FreeBSD normally.  It seems that just booting
directly from the hard disk is the problem.

Any other ideas?  Any info I can send you?
