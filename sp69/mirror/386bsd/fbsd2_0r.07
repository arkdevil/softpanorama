Questions about the MultiBoot procedures with FreeBSD 2.0R.

To the point. I have ftp'd the text files from FreeBSD.org in preparation
for my first attempt to install a real OS on my PC. There was a 
walkthrough of an installation, that covered the ideal situation. I
am concerned because my setup will be not so simple.
  Config  486DX 66
          IDE 340MB drive for DOS and windows
          BusLogic 445c SCSI controller.
          Plextor CD on 445c
          Soundblaster 16 SCSI
          (upgrade to ATI GUP)
          (upgrade w/ 500+ Mb SCSI disk)

  1) How does any of this walkthrough change (logically) with the
     installation on drive 1? I assume the IDE will be drive 0.

  2) I plan to dedicate the entire SCSI dick to FreeBSD. This means
     no DOS partition. The 445c has the bios turned off.  Will the 
     MultiBoot be placed on drive 0 or 1?
 
  3) Is there a DOS program that will cause the machine to wipe out DOS
     and boot up in unix? I think I read about this in the Dr. Dobbs
     atricles a couple of years ago when the 386BSD port was being serialized.
 
  4) Is system boot the only time FreeBSD can be selected? ( I know
     you can't swap back and forth between the two.)

I have FreeBSD 2.0R on order from Walnut Creek. I have been preparing
for this event for 6 months now. I have worked parttime as a sysadmin
on SunOS, Venix, and OSF/1; but this has always been at the user level
(new users, network config, daemon configs, etc) but never with kernal
rebuilding or internals).

The bottom line is should I drop the $800 I am planning to use to
upgrade my system, just to find that it won't configure in any but
the ideal hardware configuration?
