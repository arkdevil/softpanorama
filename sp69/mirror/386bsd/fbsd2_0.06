Yo guys...

Maybe it's my turn to pick up the conical hat now, I don't mind as
long as find out what went wrong...

I tried to install FreeBSD-2.0R this morning (I'm still at it...)
and there is a couple o' things that went a bit by west...

First, I wanted to install the bindist from the Exabyte. No joy.
The bloody thing is rst1 and the installscript insists on rst0.
This should be selectable (hint, hint, hint... ;-))
Due to lack of terminators and manuals (they are at work...) I had
a hellish time getting the thing to answer on /dev/rst0. Well, at last 
I managed it, but then again Murphy jumped up and poked me in the back.
Yup, I got "error accessing rst0". Sigh.
Exit to a shell, try /dev/rst0.1, yup it works... rm /dev/rst0, fix a 

symbolic link from rst0.1 to rst0. Does it work now? Nahhh...
Well, what the heck, I'll do it manually... (clever, eh?)
Ok, so I extracted the dist tape to an existing partition. No problem.
Then I tried to install from UFS. The only thing I accomplished by
this was to get the error: not a valid distribution". Sigh...

Had to do it all "by hand". It worked, but... Sigh.
The install program is nifty, but... well, sigh..

Oh, yes, I'm not whining nor am I complaining. I know that there has 
been put in a tremendous amount of work in the install procedure.
It is just another install report...

Cheers,
	Paul.
