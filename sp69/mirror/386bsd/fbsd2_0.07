;-) Maybe We can share the conical hat ;-)

First of all, thanks for such a wonderful FreeBSD 2.0 !!!  I finally
got it installed ... but it was partly a hard way.

I hope some install bugs are solved for a 2.0.1 release on CD.  Hope
it's not too late ! Since I had bif trouble with nearly all of the
installation methods, that are part of the new installation
program....

NETWORK INSTALLATION
====================

Via ftp ... doesn't work. Router was a Solaris 2.4 machine with a
pppconnection to my Internet provider. ping ftp.freebsd.org worked from
both: freebsd machine and Solaris machine ...

Ethernet card Elite Ethercard 16 (SMC, 8013).  IRQ: 9, IOMEM 0xc8000,
Port: 280. The card is software configured and everything is ok, I get
connections to a SS2 ....

There was a message I can't remember now ... no passwd entry (8) or
such ?!

TAPE - INSTALLATION
===================

My tape won't be recognized ... nothing is being extracted. I had to
do it manually after making a shell escape with 'ESC ESC'.

My configuration: 80486/33 Elitegroup, EISA, AHA 1542B (default
settings), Maxtor 8760-S (ID:0), Toshiba 3401 (ID:6), Archive Viper
2525 (ID:4).

tar tvf /dev/rst0 works when I type it in a shell session. But when I
choose tape install from the menue, then the tape won't be attached ...
you see and hear nothing ... Extraction failed

after that I deceided to extract manually and do a installation
from an existing partition

UFS - Installation
==================

I extracted it manually and tried then installation from local disk ...
then I made the experience, that I had to fiddle around with symlinks,
to make a package tree suitable for the install programm

	../FreeBSD/2.0-RELEASE/bindist/....
				....  /man
				....  /....
					
and in bindist (!!!), mandist, dict .,.

NFS - INSTALLATION
==================

The same strangeness with paths again in NFS installation ....

BTW: a note would be nice ... What about asking the user for name and
IP Adress of the installation server, if nameserver IP-Addr. shell
variable is "" ?! Might be easier for the ordinary user ...  The
example hostname:/path doesn't match an installation without DNS
services.

Then the NFS mount fails ...  mount seems to expect mount_nfs in
/usr/sbin. If you make a symlink /usr/sbin/mount_nfs -> /stand/mount_nfs,
then mount complains about NFS support not compiled in.

Solution, shell escape and call mount_nfs directly.nt------------------------------------------------------------------
After installation I noticed, the following things, that should be
corrected ... Hope, these things are corrected before CD is being
created ;-)
------------------------------------------------------------------

a) /tmp doesn't have proper permissions, so editing files as normal
   user fails. Solution: chmod 1777 /tmp

b) /etc/hostname.interface name is missing, in my case
   /etc/hostname.ed0 was missing ... So networking isn't setup 
   properly since ifconfig fails because of the missing file
   /etc/hostname.ed0

c) The symbolic link /sys -> /usr/src/sys is missing. 
   Would be nice to find it again there ;-)

d) When exporting filesystems and mounting via NFS there is an
   error message, that /var/tmp/...db is missing

e) maybe I'm wrong, but I think /etc/hosts is missing the
   hostname without domain appended and the alias 'loghost' ?!

f) /sys/i386/conf/LINT is missing the option DUMMY_NOPS and
   TUNE_1542 for reference. I use these options without any problems
   ...

Hope, thats all ;-) 

Would be nice if you could correct all or some of it before
distributing the release on CD Rom !!! I think many people might have
severe problems to install the release ...

But if you get it installed .... GREAT OS ...  It's faster then FreeBSD
1.X even with a larger kernel !!!

Thanks
