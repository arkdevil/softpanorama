No, wdc0 and wdc1 are the names of the first two (IDE) hard disk
*controllers*.  More likely you have one controller (wdc0) and two
disks attached to it (wd0 and wd1).

Do you have some fancy caching controller?  If so, try disabling caching.
Also try booting MSDOS first, then doing ctl-alt-del.  Or if that's what
you're doing already, try booting BSD straight from power on, without
booting anything else first.
