Well, it sounds like a nice idea Jordan, but what the hell?  The
floppy drive on a *BSD system is about equivalent to a DEC TK50
cartridge. 

You only need to use it for those first two floppies, after that
everything that comes in and out is through the net!  I have lots
of 1.2Mb floppy drives laying around, but few 1.44Mb.  Why go out
and pay $50 for something you only plan to use for 60 minutes or
so?

My solution was to steal a 1.44Mb out of another machine for the
install and then put the 1.2Mb back in.   Now I'm kinda considering
yanking the 1.2Mb floppy until the next major release.

FreeBSD-2.0 (and NetBSD 1.0 too, but I haven't looked at it yet) --

			RULES!

The difference between 1.1 and 2.0 is quite pleasing.  This floppy
drive size thing just makes it a little more convenient for those
of us who are running dedicated machines that didn't need the 
extra investment of a spiffy floppy drive.  When I need a floppy
in or out I just telnet over to the OS/2 box and ftp stuff around.

:)
