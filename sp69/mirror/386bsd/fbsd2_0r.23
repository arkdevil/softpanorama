Subject: FreeBSD-2.0 - How to configure 3c509 ?

I'm trying to install 2.0R, but can't get the network interface up.
It's a 3c509 connected to aui, and the card is recognized by the kernel.

Seems to me that I can't make it use the AUI port, are there any
options to ifconfig to force aui?

Here's what i've tried 
 # ifconfig lo0 inet 127.0.0.1 up
 # ifconfig ep0 inet 129.177.31.175 netmask 0xffffff00 up

Then ifconfig reports interfaces up & running, but from the transceiver
LEDs I can see that nothing is ever transmitted. The hardware involved
should be working - at least I had it working with dos until right now
when I repartitioned the disk for FreeBSD.

I'm grateful for any advice.
