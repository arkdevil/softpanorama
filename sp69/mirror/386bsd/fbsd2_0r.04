I just obtained and installed FreeBSD 2.0 (Release) and have run across
a problem in netstat.  Everything seems to be working, routing, named,
etc., but, when issuing a netstat  (or netstat with any switches), I
get the following error:

netstat: kvm_read kvm_read: Bad address

This is with the IPFIREWALL kernel running.  The only changes in the
kernel I made were to delete hardware/controllers not in the system.
(i.e. SCSI, PCI, etc).

We're using a NE2000 board (ed1).

I tried recompiling the libkvm library, no change.

Again, everything is running fine, except for netstat.  (which would
be nice to have!) :-)

Any ideas?

Steve
