Could you please, however, provide some *formal* way for people to
work-around these things by posting a list of the problems and the
work-arounds in an obviously named file at ftp.freebsd.com.  That would
save you from having to answer the same questions 59 times, and would
prevent me from muttering nasty things about jkh under my breath... ;-)

Or, keep fixing the install disks...

Or, provide a fixme tarball...
