   Well I have sunk well over a day into installing FreeBSD 2.0R and I am
   completely stumped.  At no stage either during installation or afterwards
   have I been able to get NFS to mount disks from our suns.  This was 
   a particular pain during installation since I was intending to install

1st question:

	Is it impossible for you to use ftp to install the machine?
	I know this doesn't fix the NFS problem, but it'd at least get
	you up into a fully multiuser environment where we could then
	try to debug the NFS problem in isolation from the installation
	process, since it looks like you're having a generic NFS problem.

2nd question:

	What sort of network card do you have?  Have you tried reducing
	the read and write size by specifying:

		-r=1024,-w=1024

	To the NFS options dialog?

   Next step - I bring up the whole shebang with ftp and still it fails
   to nfs mount.  I now notice that /etc/netstart has nfs_client and
   nfs_server set to "NO" - this can't help, so I change it and reboot.

Ah, ok, so you can use ftp to install.  Go do this again and we'll
try and fix the NFS problems as a second-order problem.

   OK - now I conclude that the kernel that is provided must be lacking nfs,
   so up goes the whole srcdist and I rebuild - knowing for sure that nfs
   is now in, and /etc/netstart is set up ok.  Still no nfs.

No, that's not true.  NFS is definitely in there, and I use it all
over the place both at Walnut Creek CDROM and here.  Something is not
quite right somewhere else.  Don't worry, we'll find it!

Feel free to take this to email for faster resolution of the problem.
I am in Ireland at the moment and don't have time to read a lot of
USENET.
