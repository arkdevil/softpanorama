This document contains the compiled information from a continuing
research effort by the author into the identification, detection and
removal of MS-DOS Computer Viruses.  Hopefully, this listing will
provide some assistance to those who wish to know more about a
particular computer virus.  It is not intended to provide a very
detailed technical description, but to allow the reader to understand
what a virus generally does, how it activates, what it is doing to their
system, and most importantly, how to get rid of it.

The user of this listing needs to keep in mind that the information
provided is up-to-date only to the date of the listing itself.  If the
listing is one month old, some items may not be accurate.  Also, with
the wide dispersion of researchers and the various names that the same
virus may be known by, some of the information may not be entirely
accurate.  Lastly, as new variants of known viruses are isolated, some
of the characteristics of the variant may be different.

There are five sections to the listing.  The first section is an
introduction which explains the format of the information in the listing
and includes the code information used in some fields. The second
section is the actual virus information listing. The third section is a
cross-reference of common names for MS-DOS computer viruses and
indicates what name to use for the virus in the second section.  The
fourth section, added with the July 1990 release and in the works for
many months, is a chart showing relationships between various viruses
and variants.  Lastly, there is a fifth section which is a revision
history of the listing.

Anti-Viral products mentioned in the listing are either commonly
available shareware or public domain programs, or they are commercial
products which have been submitted for evaluation and review by the
product's author with "no strings attached".  All Anti-Viral products
are reviewed at the most recent release level available to the author.
In some cases, this may not be the most recent release.  All testing is
done against the author's virus collection, results using a different
collection of viruses and variants may differ.

Special thanks go to John McAfee for reviewing the listing before it is
distributed, as well Padgett Peterson of Orlando, Florida who
volunteered several hours of his time to assist in formatting the
listing and breaking out additional information.

                     Virus Information Summary List
                      Introduction & Entry Format

Each of the entries in the list consists of several fields. Below is a
brief description of what is indicated in each of the fields.  For
fields where codes may appear, the meaning of each code in indicated.

 Virus Name: Field contains one of the more common names for the
             virus.  The listing is alphabetized based on this
             field.
 Aliases:    Other names that the same virus may be referred to by.
             These names are aliases or A.K.A.'s.
 V Status:   This field contains one of the following values which indicate
             how common the virus is in the public domain.
             Common: The virus is one of the most common viruses reported to
                  various groups which gather virus infection statistics.
                  Most of these groups are in the United States.  Where a
                  virus has had many reports from a specific geographic area,
                  the V Status field will contain "Common - xxxxxxxxx" where
                  xxxxxxxxx is an indicator of geographic location.
             Endangered: The "Endangered" classification of viruses are
                  viruses that are very uncommon and were fairly recently
                  discovered or isolated.  Due to some characteristics of
                  these viruses, it is highly unlikely that they will ever
                  become a widespread problem.  It doesn't mean that they
                  don't exist, just that the probability of someone getting
                  these viruses is fairly low.
             Extinct: The "Extinct" classification is for viruses which at
                  one time may have been widespread (ie. they are not a
                  research virus which was never released into the public
                  domain), but have not had a reported infection in at least
                  one year.  "Extinct" viruses will also include "viruses"
                  which were submitted which actually don't replicate due to
                  a flaw in their viral code, but if the flaw were corrected
                  they might be successful.  It is still possible that someone
                  could become infected with one of these viruses, but the
                  probability is extremely low.
             Myth: "Myth" viruses are viruses which have been discussed among
                  various groups for some time (in excess of one year), but are
                  not known to actually exist as either a public domain or
                  research virus.  Probably the best case of a "Myth" virus
                  is the Nichols Virus.
             Rare: "Rare" viruses are viruses which were recently (within the
                  last year) isolated but which do not appear to be widespread.
                  These viruses, as a general rule, will be viruses which
                  have characteristics that would make them a possible
                  future problem.  "Rare" viruses have a higher probability
                  of someone becoming infected than Endangered or Extinct
                  viruses, but are much less likely to be found than a
                  "Common" virus.
             Research: A "Research" virus is a virus which was originally
                  received by at least one anti-viral researcher directly
                  from its source or author.  These viruses are not known
                  to have been released into the public domain, so they are
                  highly unlikely to be detected on computer systems other
                  than researchers.
             Rumored: The "Rumored" virus classification are for viruses
                  which the author has received information about, but that
                  no sample of the virus has been made available for analysis.
                  Any viruses in this classification should be considered with
                  a grain of salt, they may not actually exist.
             Unknown: The "Unknown" classification is for those viruses where
                  the original submission of the virus to anti-viral researchers
                  is suspect for any number of reasons, or that there is
                  very little information known about the origin of the
                  virus.
             New: The "New" category is for viruses which were recently
                  received by the author but cannot at the present time be
                  researched in depth.  Instead of leaving these viruses out
                  of the listing all together, they will be listed but with
                  a "New" status.
 Discovery:  First recorded discovery date.
 Origin:     Author/country of origin
 Symptoms:   Changes to system that may be noticed by users: messages,
             growth in files, TSRs/ Resident TOM (change in CHKDSK
             return), BSC - boot sector change (may require cold boot
             from known-good protected floppy to find), corruption of
             system or files, frequent re-boots, slowdowns.
 Origin:     Either credited or assumed to be in country of discovery.
 Eff Length: The length of the viral code after it has infected
             a program or system component.  For boot-sector infectors,
             the length is indicated as N/A, for not applicable.
 Type Code:  The type codes indicated for a virus indicate general
             behavior characteristics.  Following the type code(s) is
             a brief text description.  The type codes used are:
             A = Infects all program files (COM & EXE)
             B = Boot virus
             C = Infects COM files only
             D = Infects DOS boot sector on hard disk
             E = Infects EXE files only
             F = Floppy (360K) only
             K = Infects COMMAND.COM
             M = Infects Master boot sector on hard disk
             N = Non-resident (in memory)
             O = Overwriting virus
             P = Parasitic virus
             R = Resident (in memory)
               (below 640k - segment A000)
                 a - in unused portion of allocated memory
                     (does not change free memory, such as virus resident
                      in CLI stack space or unused system memory)
                     Example: LeHigh
                 f - in free (user) memory below TOM
                     (does not prevent overwritting)
                     Example: Icelandic
                 h - in high memory but below TOM
                     (Resides in high system memory, right below TOM.
                     Memory is allocated so it won't be accidently
                     overwritten.)
                     Example: Flash
                 s - in low (system/TSR) memory
                     (reduces free memory, typically uses a normal
                     Int 21/Int 28 TSR)
                     Example: Jerusalem
                 t - above TOM but below 640k (moves Int 12 return)
                     (Reduces total memory size and free memory)
                     Example: Pakistani Brain
               (above 640k)
                 b - in BIOS/Video/Shadow RAM area (segment A000 - FFFF)
                 e - in extended/expanded memory (above 1 Meg)
             S = Spawning virus
             T = Manipulation of the File Allocation Table (FAT)
             X = Manipulation/Infection of the Partition Table

                         Virus Information Summary List
                            MS-DOS Virus Information


 Virus Name:  382 Recovery Virus
 Aliases:     382
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovery:   July, 1990
 Symptoms:    first 382 bytes of .COM files overwritten, system hangs,
              spurious characters on system display, disk drive spinning
 Origin:      Taiwan
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   ONAK - Overwriting Non-Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The 382 Recovery Virus was isolated in July 1990 in Taiwan.  It is
       a non-resident generic infector of .COM and .EXE files, including
       COMMAND.COM.

       Each time a program infected with the 382 Recovery Virus is executed,
       the virus will check the current directory for a .COM files that has
       not been infected with the virus.  If it finds an uninfected .COM
       file, it will infect it.  If the original file was less than 382 bytes
       in length, the infected file will now be 382 bytes in length.  Files
       which were originally greater than 382 bytes in length will not show
       any increase in length.  Infected files always have the first 382
       bytes of the file overwritten to contain the virus's code.

       Once all .COM files in the current directory are infected, the next
       time an infected .COM file is executed the virus will rename all .EXE
       files to .COM files.  These renamed files, however, may or may not
       later become infected.

       Symptoms of the 382 Recovery Virus being present on a file are that
       the program will not execute properly.  In some cases, the program will
       hang upon execution requiring the system to be rebooted.  In other
       cases, spurious characters will appear on the system display and the
       program will not run.  Lastly, the system may do nothing but leave the
       disk drive spinning, requiring the system to be powered off and
       rebooted.

       Since the first 382 bytes of infected files have been overwritten,
       the infected files cannot be recovered.  The original 382 bytes of
       the file are permanently lost.  Infected files should be deleted or
       erased and replaced with backup copies known to be free of infection.


 Virus Name:  405
 Aliases:
 V Status:    Extinct
 Discovery:   1987
 Symptoms:    .COM files fail to run, first 405 bytes of .COM files
              overwritten
 Origin:      Austria or Germany
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   ONC - Overwriting Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan 1.4+, VirexPC 1.1+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, F-Prot, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The 405 virus is an overwriting virus which infects only .COM
       files in the current directory.  If the length of the .COM file
       was originally less than 405 bytes, the resulting infected file
       will have a length of 405 bytes.  This virus currently cannot
       recognize .COM files that are already infected, so it will
       attempt to infect them again.

       The 405 Virus doesn't carry an activation date, and doesn't do
       anything but replicate in the current directory.  However, since
       it overwrites the first 405 bytes of .COM files, infected files
       are not recoverable except by replacing them from uninfected
       backups or master distribution disks.


 Virus Name:  512
 Aliases:     512-A, Number of the Beast Virus, Stealth Virus
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovery:   November, 1989
 Origin:      Bulgaria
 Symptoms:    Program crashes, system hangs, .COM file growth, TSR.
 Eff Length:  512 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRCK - Parasitic Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V58+, Pro-Scan 1.4+, VirexPC 1.1+
 Removal Instructions: CleanUp V58+, Pro-Scan 1.4+
 General Comments:
       The 512 virus is not the same as the Original Friday The 13th COM
       virus.  The 512 virus was originally isolated in Bulgaria in
       January, 1990, by Vesselin Bontchev.  It infects .COM files,
       including COMMAND.COM, installing itself memory resident when the
       first infected program is run.  After becoming memory resident, any
       .COM file openned for any reason will become infected if its
       uninfected length is at least 512 bytes.

       Systems infected with the 512 virus will experience program crashes
       due to unexpected errors, as well as system hangs.  This virus also
       will destroy some file linkages when it infects files.

       The virus's alias of "Number of the Beast" Virus is because the
       author of the virus used a signature of text 666 near the end of the
       virus to determine if the file is already infected.  Since 512 adds
       its viral code to the end of infected files, it is easy to verify
       that a file is infected by the 512 virus by checking for this
       signature.

       Known variant(s) of the 512 Virus are:
       512-B : Similar to the 512 Variant, except that the DOS version check

               signature of '666' has been omitted.
       512-C : Similar to the 512-B Variant, minor code changes.
       512-D : Similar to the 512-C Variant, except that the virus no longer
               checks to see if a file has the System Attribute on it before
               infecting it.  Author's signature is the hex string BE10
               located at the end of infected files.


 Virus Name:  1008
 Aliases:
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovery:   June, 1990
 Symptoms:    COMMAND.COM growth, Internal Stack Error and System Halt on Boot
 Origin:
 Eff Length:  1,008 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRK - Parasitic Resident COMMAND.COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V64+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The 1008 Virus was discovered in June, 1990.  It is a memory resident
       COMMAND.COM infector.  It does not infect other .COM files.

       The first time a program infected with the 1008 virus is executed,
       the virus will install itself memory resident.  COMMAND.COM is also
       infected at this time, resulting in its length increasing by 1,008
       Bytes.  The increase in file size of COMMAND.COM cannot be seen by
       doing a directory listing if the virus is present in memory.

       Booting a system with an infected copy of COMMAND.COM may result in
       an internal stack error, and the system being halted.  This effect
       was noted on the author's test machine which is a 640K XT-clone
       running Microsoft MS-DOS Version 3.30.

 Type Code:   PRE - Parasitic Resident .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V61+, Pro-Scan 1.4+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The 1210, or Prudents Virus, was first isolated in Barcelona, Spain,
       in December 1989.  The 1210 is a memory resident virus, infecting
       .EXE files when they are executed.

       This virus activates between May 1st and May 4th of any year,
       causing disk writes to be changed to disk verifies, so writes to
       the disk never occur between these dates.


 Virus Name:  1226
 Aliases:     V1226

 Discovery:   July 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM growth, decrease in system and free memory, system hangs,
              spurious characters displayed in place of program executing,
              disk drive spinning
 Origin:      Bulgaria
 Eff Length:  1,226 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRhC - Parasitic Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The 1226 Virus was isolated in Bulgaria in July 1990 by Vesselin
       Bontchev.  This virus is a memory resident generic .COM infector,
       though it does not infect COMMAND.COM.  The 1226 Virus is a self-
       encrypting virus, and simple search string algorithms will not work
       to detect its presence on a system.

       The first time a program infected with the 1226 virus is executed,
       the virus will install itself memory resident, reserving 8,192 bytes
       of memory at the top of free memory.  Interrupt 2A will be hooked.

       Once 1226 is memory resident, the virus will attempt to infect any
       .COM file that is executed that is at least 1,226 bytes in length
       before infection.  The virus is rather "buggy" and the infection
       process is not always entirely successful.  Successfully infected
       files will increase in length by 1,226 bytes.

       This virus will infect .COM files multiple times, it is unable to
       determine that the file is already infected.  Each time the file
       is infected it will grow in length by another 1,226 bytes.  Eventually,
       the .COM files will grow too large to fit into memory.

       Systems infected with the 1226 virus may experience unexpected system
       hangs when attempting to execute programs.  Another affect is that
       instead of a program executing, a line or two of spurious characters
       will appear on the system display.  Lastly, infected systems will always
       indicate that they have 8,192 less bytes of total system and free
       memory available than is actually on the machine.

       There are two later versions of this virus, 1226D and 1226M, which are
       much better replicators than the original 1226 virus.  These two
       variants are documented as 1226D in this document due to their
       different characteristics.

 Eff Length:  1,226 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRhC - Parasitic Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The 1226D Virus was isolated in Bulgaria in July 1990 by Vesselin
       Bontchev.  This virus is a memory resident generic .COM infector,
       though it does not infect COMMAND.COM.  The 1226D Virus is a self-
       encrypting virus, and simple search string algorithms will not work
       to detect its presence on a system.

       The 1226D Virus is based on the 1226 Virus, and has had several bugs
       in the 1226 Virus fixed.  It is a much better replicator, infecting
       successfully on file opens as well as when .COM files are executed.

       The first time a program infected with the 1226 virus is executed,
       the virus will install itself memory resident, reserving 8,192 bytes
       of memory at the top of free memory.  Total system and free memory
       are decreased by 8,192 bytes.  Interrupt 2A will be hooked.

       Once 1226 is memory resident, the virus will attempt to infect any
       .COM file that is executed that is at least 1,226 bytes in length
       before infection.  Infected files will increase in length by 1,226
       bytes.  As with the original 1226 Virus, a .COM file may be infected
       multiple times by the 1226D Virus as the virus is unable to determine
       that the file was previously infected.  Each infection will result in
       another 1,226 bytes being added to the infected file's length.
       Eventually, the .COM files will grow too large to fit into memory.

       In addition to infecting .COM files when they are executed, the 1226D
       Virus will infect .COM files with a length of at least 1,226 bytes
       when they are openned for any reason.  The simple act of copying a
       .COM file with the virus memory resident will result in both the
       source and target files being infected.

       Unlike the 1226 Virus, systems infected with the 1226D virus will not
       experience the system hangs or spurious characters symptomatic of the
       1226 virus.  Infected system will still indicate that they have 8,192
       bytes less of total system memory than is installed on the machine.

       Known variant(s) of 1226D are:
       1226M/V1226M : Similar to the 1226D virus, except that files are not
                 infected on file open, only when they are executed.

 Virus Name:  1253
 Aliases:     AntiCad, V-1
 V Status:    New
 Discovey:    August, 1990
 Symptoms:    TSR; BSC; COMMAND.COM & .COM file growth; partition table change
 Origin:      Austria
 Eff Length:  1,253 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRstBCKX - Parasitic Resident .COM & Partition Table Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D plus MDisk/P
 General Comments:
       The 1253 Virus was submitted in August 1990.  It is believed to have
       originated in (or at least to have been first isolated in) Austria.
       1253 is a generic infector of .COM files, including COMMAND.COM.
       It also infects the boot sector of diskettes and the partition table
       of hard disks.

       The first time a program infected with the 1253 Virus is executed, the
       virus will install itself memory resident as a low system memory TSR.
       The TSR will be 2,128 bytes in length, hooking interrupts 08, 13, 21,
       and 60.  Total system memory will remain unchanged, and free memory
       will decrease by 2,128 bytes.  At this time, the partition table of
       the system's hard disk is infected with the 1253 virus.  If the
       infected program was executed from a diskette, the diskette's boot
       sector will also be infected.

       Each time a .COM file is executed with the virus resident in memory,
       the .COM file will be infected if it hasn't previously been infected.
       The 1253 Virus appends its viral code to the end of the .COM file, and
       then changes the first few bytes of the program to be a jump to the
       appended code.  Infected files increase in length by 1,253 bytes, and
       the virus makes no attempt to hide the increase when the directory
       is displayed.  Infected files will also have their fourth thru sixth
       bytes set to "V-1" (hex 562D31).

       Any diskettes which are accessed while the virus is present in memory
       will have their boot sector infected with this virus.  Newly formatted
       diskettes, likewise, will be infected immediately.

       The 1253 virus is destructive when it activates.  The author of this
       listing was able to get it to activate by setting the system date to
       December 24 and then executing an infected program on drive A:.  The
       virus promptly went and overwrote the entire diskette in drive
       A: with a pattern of 9 sectors of what appears to be a program
       fragment.  Once the virus has started to overwrite a diskette, the
       only way to stop the disk activity is to power off the system.

       The virus in the partition table and/or diskette boot sector is of
       special note.  When the system is booted from the hard disk or diskette
       with the virus in the partition table or boot sector, the virus will
       install itself memory resident.  At this time, the virus resides above
       the top of system memory but below the 640K DOS boundary.  The change
       in total system memory and available free memory will be 77,840 bytes.
       It can be seen with the CHKDSK command.  At this time, any .COM program
       executed will be infected with the 1253 virus, even though no programs
       on the hard disk may contain this virus before the system boot occurred.

       One effect of this virus, once the system has been booted from an
       infected hard drive or floppy is that the FORMAT command may result
       in unexpected disk activity to inactive drives.  For example, on the
       author's system, when formatting a diskette in drive A: with the
       current drive being drive C:, there was always disk activity to drive
       B:.

       Disinfecting the 1253 virus required that besides disinfecting or
       deleting infected .COM programs, the hard disks partition table and the
       boot sector of any diskettes exposed to the infected system must be
       disinfected.  The virus can be removed safely from the partition table
       and diskette boot sectors by using MDisk with the /P option after
       powering off the system and rebooting from a write-protected uninfected
       boot diskette.  If the partition table and diskette boot sectors are
       not disinfected, the system will promptly experience reinfection of
       .COM files with the virus following a system boot from the hard disk
       or diskette.  Disinfecting the partition table and boot sectors, when
       done properly, will also result in the system's full memory again being
       available.

       It is unknown if there are other activation dates for this virus, or
       if it will overwrite the hard disk if an infected program is executed
       on December 24 from the hard disk.

 Type Code:   PNC - Parasitic Encrypting Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V57+, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan 1.4+
 Removal Instructions: CleanUp V57+, Pro-Scan 1.4+
 General Comments:
       The 1260 virus was first isolated in January, 1990.  This
       virus does not install itself resident in memory, but is it
       extremely virulent at infecting .COM files.  Infected files
       will have their length increased by 1,260 bytes, and the
       resulting file will be encrypted.  The encryption key changes
       with each infection which occurs.

       The 1260 virus is derived from the original Vienna Virus, though
       it is highly modified.

       The 1260 virus can infect a local area network, including the

 Detection Method:  ViruScan V64+
 Removal Instructions:  Scan/D, or Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The 1381 Virus was isolated in June, 1990.  It is a non-resident
       generic .EXE infector.

       Each time a program infected with the 1381 Virus is executed, the
       virus will attempt to infect one other .EXE file on the current
       drive.  An .EXE file will only be infected if it is greater than
       1,300 bytes in length before infection.  After infection, files
       will have increased in length by between 1,381 and 1,389 bytes.

       The virus can be found at the end of infected files.  Infected
       files will also contain the following text strings:

              "INTERNAL ERROR 02CH.
               PLEASE CONTACT YOUR HARDWARE MANUFACTURER IMMEDIATELY !
               DO NOT FORGET TO REPORT THE ERROR CODE !"

       It is currently unknown what the 1381 Virus does, or what prompts
       it to display the above message.

 Type Code:   PRA - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method: ViruScan V61+, VirexPC 1.1+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The 1392, or Amoeba, Virus was first isolated in Indonesia in
       March 1990.  The 1392 virus is a memory resident virus that infects
       .COM and .EXE files, including COMMAND.COM.  As files are infected,
       their creation/modification date is changed to the date the files
       were infected.

       This virus does not appear to cause any destructive damage.

       The following message appears in the virus, which is where its
       alias of Amoeba was derived from:

              "SMA KHETAPUNK - Nouvel Band A.M.O.E.B.A"

 General Comments:
       The 1554 virus was accidently sent out over the VALERT-L network
       on February 13, 1990 to approximately 600 subscribers.  When a
       program is executed that is infected with the 1554 virus, the
       virus installs itself memory resident.  It will then proceed to
       infect .COM over 1000 bytes in length and .EXE files over 1024 bytes
       in length, including COMMAND.COM, increasing their length after
       infection by 1,554 to 1,569 bytes.

       The 1554 virus activates in September, October, November, or
       December of any year.  Upon activation, any files which are written
       will be missing the first ten bytes.  At the end of these files,
       ten bytes of miscellaneous characters will appear.  In effect, both
       programs and data files will be corrupted.

       If the 1554 Virus is executed on a system with less than 640K of
       system memory, the virus will hang the system.

 Origin:      Spain
 Eff Length:  1,720 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRsA - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method: ViruScan V61+, VirexPC 1.1+
 Removal Instructions: Scan /D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The 1720, or PSQR Virus, is a variant of the Jerusalem Virus which
       was first isolated in Barcelona, Spain, in March 1990.  This virus,
       infects .COM and .EXE files, though unlike Jerusalem, it does not
       infect Overlay files.  COMMAND.COM will also not be infected.

       The first time an infected file is executed, the virus will install
       itself memory resident, and then infect each executable file as it
       is run.

       On Friday The 13ths, the 1720 Virus will activate the first time an
       infected program is executed.  When the program is executed, it will
       be deleted from disk.  More damaging, however, is that the 1720 virus
       will check to see if the system has a hard disk drive.  If a hard
       disk drive is present, the virus will overwrite the boot sector and
       partition table resulting in all data on the hard disk becoming
       unavailable.  The system will also appear to hang.

 Origin:      Israel
 Eff Length:  4,096 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRsA - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V53+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC 1.1+
 Removal Instructions: CleanUp V62+, Pro-Scan 1.4+, F-Prot, or see note below
 General Comments:
       The 4096 virus was first isolated in January, 1990.  This virus
       is considered a "Phase II" virus in that it is almost invisible
       to the system user.

       The 4096 virus infects .COM, .EXE, and Overlay files, adding
       4,096 bytes to their length.  Once the virus is resident in
       system memory, the increase in length will not appear in a
       directory listing.  Once this virus has installed itself into
       memory, it will infect any executable file that is opened,
       including if it is opened with the COPY or XCOPY command.

       This virus is destructive to both data files and executable
       files, as it very slowly crosslinks files on the system's
       disk.  The crosslinking occurs so slowly that it appears there
       is a hardware problem, the virus being almost invisible.  The
       crosslinking of files is the result of the virus manipulating
       the FATs, changing the number of available sectors, as well as
       the user issuing CHKDSK/F commands which will think that the
       files have lost sectors or crosslinking if the virus is in
       memory.

       As a side note, if the virus is present in memory and you
       attempt to copy infected files, the new copy of the file will
       not be infected with the virus if the new copy does not have
       an executable file extension.  Thus, one way to disinfect
       a system is to copy off all the infected files to diskettes with a
       non-executable file extension (ie. don't use .EXE, .COM, .SYS, etc)
       while the virus is active in memory, then power off the system
       and reboot from a write protected (uninfected) system disk.
       Once rebooted and the virus is not in memory, delete the
       infected files and copy back the files from the diskettes to the
       original executable file names and extensions.

       The above will disinfect the system, if done correctly, but
       will still leave the problem of cross-linked files which are
       permanently damaged.

       On or after September 22 of any year, the 4096 virus will hang
       infected systems.  This appears to be a "bug" in the virus in that
       it goes into a time consuming loop.

       The 4096 virus also contains a boot-sector within its code, however,
       it is never written out to the disk's boot sector.  Moving this
       boot sector to the boot sector of a diskette and rebooting the
       system will result in the message "FRODO LIVES" being displayed.
       September 22 is Bilbo and Frodo Baggin's birthday in the Lord Of
       The Rings trilogy.

       Known variant(s) of the 4096 virus include:
       4096-B    : Similar to the 4096 virus, the main change is that the
                   encryption mechanism has been changed in order to avoid
                   detection.

 Symptoms:    .COM & .EXE growth, file corruption, unexpected disk activity
 Eff Length:  5,120 Bytes
 Type Code:   PNAK - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V63+, Pro-Scan 1.4+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The 5120 Virus was first isolated in May, 1990.  It is a non-
       resident generic file infector, infecting .COM and .EXE files,
       including COMMAND.COM.  This virus is was written in Turbo Basic.

       When an infected file is executed, the 5120 virus will infect one
       .COM and one .EXE file on the current drive and directory, followed
       by attempting to infect one randomly selected .COM or .EXE file in
       each directory on the system's C: drive.  Infected .COM files increase
       in length by 5,120 bytes.  .EXE files infected by the 5120 Virus will
       increase in length by between 5,120 and 5,135 bytes.

       Unlike most of the MS-DOS viruses, the 5120 Virus does not intercept
       disk write errors when attempting to infect programs.  Thus, infected
       systems may notice disk write error messages when no access should be
       occurring for a drive, such as the C: hard disk partition.

       Data files may become corrupted on infected systems, as well as
       crosslinking of files may occur.

       The following text strings can be found in files infected with the
       5120 virus.  These strings will appear near the end of the file:

               "BASRUN"
               "BRUN"
               "IBMBIO.COM"
               "IBMDOS.COM"
               "COMMAND.COM"
               "Access denied"

       There is one variant of the 5120 Virus which does not contain the
       above strings, but behaves in a very similar manner.


 Virus Name:  AIDS
 Aliases:     Hahaha, Taunt, VGA2CGA
 V Status:    Endangered
 Discovery:   1989
 Symptoms:    Message, .COM file corruption
 Origin:
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   ONC - Overwriting Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V40+, Pro-Scan, VirexPC 1.1+
 Removal Instructions:  Scan/D, or delete infected .COM files
 General Comments:
       The AIDS virus, also known as the Hahaha virus in Europe and
       referred to as the Taunt virus by IBM, is a generic .COM and
       .EXE file infector.  When the virus activates, it displays the
       message "Your computer now has AIDS", with AIDS covering
       about half of the screen.  The system is then halted, and
       must be powered down and rebooted to restart it.  Since this
       virus overwrites the first 13K of the executable program, the
       files must be deleted and replaced with clean copies in order
       to remove the virus.  It is not possible to recover the
       overwritten portion of the program.

       Note: this is NOT the Aids Info Disk/PC Cyborg Trojan.


 Virus Name:  Aids II Virus
 Aliases:     Companion Virus
 V Status:    Endangered
 Discovery:   April, 1990
 Symptoms:    Creates .COM files, melody, message
 Origin:
 Eff Length:  8,064 Bytes
 Type Code:   SNA - Spawning Non-Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V62+, Pro-Scan 1.4+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or delete corresponding .COM files
 General Comments:
       The Aids II Virus, or Companion Virus, was isolated for the first
       time in April 1990.  Unlike other generic file infectors, the
       Aids II Virus is the first known virus to employ what could be
       termed a "corresponding file technique" of infection so that the
       original target .EXE file is never changed.  The virus takes
       advantage of the DOS feature where if a program exists in both
       .COM and .EXE form, the .COM file will be executed.

       The Aids II Virus does not directly infect .EXE files, instead it
       stores a copy of the virus in a corresponding .COM file which will
       be executed when the user trys to execute one of his .COM files.
       The .EXE file, and the .COM file containing the viral code will
       both have the same base file name.

       The method of infection is as follows:  when an "infected"
       program is executed, since a corresponding .COM file exists, the
       .COM file containing the viral code is executed.  The virus
       first locates an uninfected .EXE file in the current directory and
       creates a corresponding (or companion) .COM file with the viral
       code.  These .COM files will always be 8,064 Bytes in length with
       a file date/time of the date/time of infection.  The .EXE file is
       not altered at all.  After creating the new .COM file, the virus
       then plays a melody and displays the following message, the "*"
       indicated below actually being ansi heart characters:

                 "Your computer is infected with ...

                           * Aids Virus II *

                  - Signed WOP & PGT of DutchCrack -"

       The Aids II Virus then spawns to the .EXE file that was attempting
       to be executed, and the program runs without problem.  After
       completion of the program, control returns to the Aids II Virus.
       The melody is played again with the following message displayed:

                        "Getting used to me?

                    Next time, use a Condom ....."

       Since the original .EXE file remains unaltered, CRC checking
       programs cannot detect this virus having infected a system.

       One way to manually remove the Aids II Virus is to check the
       disk for programs which have both a .EXE and a .COM file, with
       the .COM file having a length of 8,064 bytes.  The .COM files
       thus identified should be erased.

       The displayed text strings do not appear in the viral code.


 Virus Name:  AirCop
 Aliases:
 V Status:    New
 Discovery:   July, 1990
 Isolated:    Washington, USA
 Symptoms:    BSC; System Halt; Message; decrease in system and free memory
 Origin:      Taiwan
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   FR - Resident Floppy Boot Sector Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions:  MDisk or DOS SYS command
 General Comments:
       The AirCop Virus was discovered in the State of Washington in the
       United States in July, 1990.  Some early infections of this virus,
       however, have been traced back to Taiwan, and Taiwan is probably where
       it originated.  AirCop is a boot sector infector, and it will only
       infect 360K 5.25" floppy diskettes.

       When a system is booted from a diskette which is infected with the
       AirCop virus, the virus will install itself memory resident.  The
       AirCop Virus installs itself memory resident at the top of high system
       memory.  The system memory size and available free memory will
       decrease by 1,024 bytes when the AirCop virus is memory resident.
       AirCop hooks interrupt 13.

       Once AirCop is memory resident, any non-write protected diskettes
       which are then accessed will have their boot sector infected with
       the AirCop virus.  AirCop will copy the original disk boot sector
       to sector 719 (Side 1, Cyl 39, Sector 9 on a normal 360K 5.25"
       diskette) and then replace the boot sector at sector 0 with a copy
       of the virus.  If a boot sector of a diskette infected with the
       AirCop virus is viewed, it will be missing almost all of the messages
       which normally appear in a normal boot sector.  The only message
       remaining will be:

               "Non-system..."

       This will be located just before the end of the boot sector.

       The AirCop Virus will do one of two things on infected systems,
       depending on how compatible the system's software and hardware is
       with the virus.  On most systems, the virus will display the following
       message at random intervals:

               "Red State, Germ Offensive.
                AIRCOP."

       On other systems, the virus being present will result in the system
       receiving a Stack Overflow Error and the system being halted.  In this
       case, you must power off the system in order to be able to reboot.

       AirCop currently does not infect hard disk boot sectors or partition
       tables.

       AirCop can be removed from infected diskettes by first powering
       off the system and rebooting from a known clean write protected
       DOS master diskette.  The DOS SYS command should then be used to
       replace the infected diskette's boot sector.  Alternately, MDisk
       can be used following the power-down and reboot.


 Virus Name:  Alabama
 Aliases:
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovery:   October, 1989
 Symptoms:    .EXE growth, Resident (see text), message, FAT corruption
 Origin:      Israel
 Eff Length:  1,560 bytes
 Type Code:   PRfET - Parasitic Resident .EXE infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V43+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan
 Removal Instructions:  CleanUp, F-Prot, Pro-Scan 1.4+, delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Alabama virus was first isolated at Hebrew University in
       Israel by Ysrael Radai in October, 1989.  Its first known
       activation was on October 13, 1989.  The Alabama virus will
       infect .EXE files, increasing their size by 1,560 bytes.  It
       installs itself memory resident when the first program infected
       with the virus is executed, however it doesn't use the normal
       TSR function.  Instead, this virus hooks Int 9 as well as
       IN and OUT commands.  When a CTL-ALT-DEL combination is
       detected, the virus causes an apparent boot but remains in RAM.
       The virus loads itself 30K under the highest memory location
       reported by DOS, and does not lower the amount of memory
       reported by BIOS or DOS.

       After the virus has been memory resident for one hour, the
       following message will appear in a flashing box:

       "SOFTWARE COPIES PROHIBITED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW..............
        Box 1055 Tuscambia ALABAMA USA."

       The Alabama virus uses a complex mechanism to determine whether
       or not to infect the current file.  First, it checks to see if
       there is an uninfected file in the current directory, if there
       is one it infects it.  Only if there are no uninfected files
       in the current directory is the program being executed
       infected.  However, sometimes instead of infecting the
       uninfected candidate file, it will instead manipulate the FATs
       to exchange the uninfected candidate file with the currently
       executed file without renaming it, so the user ends up thinking
       he is executing one file when in effect he is actually
       executing another one.  The end result is that files are
       slowly lost on infected systems.  This file swapping occurs
       when the virus activates on ANY Friday.


 Virus Name:  Alameda
 Aliases:     Merritt, Peking, Seoul, Yale
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovery:   1987
 Symptoms:    Floppy boot failures, Resident-TOM, BSC
 Origin:      California, USA
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   RtF - Resident Floppy Boot Sector Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, F-Prot, IBM Scan
 Removal Instructions:  MDisk, CleanUp, F-Prot, or DOS SYS
 General Comments:
       The Alameda virus was first discovered at Merritt college in
       Alameda, California in 1987.  The original version of this virus
       caused no intentional damage, though there is now at least 1
       variant of this virus that now causes floppy disks to become
       unbootable after a counter has reached its limit (Alameda-C
       virus).

       The Alameda virus, and its variants, all replicate when the
       system is booted with a CTL-ATL-DEL and infect only 5 1/4"
       360K diskettes.  These viruses do stay in memory thru a warm
       reboot, and will infect both system and non-system disks.
       System memory can be infected on a warm boot even if Basic is
       loaded instead of DOS.

       The virus saves the real boot sector at track 39, sector 8,
       head 0.  The original version of the Alameda virus would only
       run on a 8086/8088 machine, though later versions can now run
       on 80286 systems.

 Virus Name:  Ambulance Car Virus
 Aliases:     RedX
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovery:   June, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM growth, graphic display & sound
 Origin:      West Germany
 Eff Length:  796 Bytes
 Type Code:   PNC - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method: ViruScan V64+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Ambulance Car Virus was isolated in West Germany in June, 1990.
       This virus is a non-resident .COM infector.

       When a program infected with the Ambulance Car Virus is executed,
       the virus will attempt to infect one .COM file.  The .COM file to
       be infected will be located on the C: drive.  This virus only infects
       one .COM file in any directory, and never the first .COM file in
       the directory.  It avoids infecting COMMAND.COM as that file is
       normally the first .COM file in the root directory.

       On a random basis, when an infected file is executed it will
       have the affect of a graphics display of an ASCII block drawing of
       an ambulance moving across the bottom of the system display.  This
       graphics display will be accompanied with the sound of a siren
       played on the system's speaker.  Both of these effects only occur
       on systems with a graphics capable display adapter.


 Virus Name:  Amstrad

 Type Code:   PNC - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V51+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC 1.1+
 Removal Instructions:  Scan/D, F-Prot, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or erase infected files
 General Comments:
       The Amstrad virus was first reported in November, 1989, by
       Jean Luz of Portugal, however it has been known of in Spain
       and Portugal for a year prior to that.  The virus is a generic
       .COM infector, but is not memory resident nor does it infect
       COMMAND.COM.

       The virus carries a fake advertisement for the Amstrad computer.

       The Amstrad virus appears to cause no other damage to the
       system other than replicating and infecting files.

       Known variants of the Amstrad Virus are:
       Pixel/V-345 - Similar to the Amstrad virus described above, except
                     that the virus is 345 Bytes in length, can now infect
                     COMMAND.COM, and contains the message:
                     "=!= Program sick error:Call doctor or by PIXEL for
                     cure description".  This message is not displayed.
                     The Pixel virus was originally distributed in Greece
                     by Pixel magazine.  The Pixel Virus can only infect
                     programs in the current directory.
                     Origin: Greece
       V-277       - Similar to the Pixel/V-345 virus described above, except
                     that the virus is now 277 Bytes in length, and does not
                     contain any message text.  The original message text
                     has been replaced with code to produce a parity error
                     approximately 50% of the time when an infected program
                     is executed.
                     Origin: Bulgaria
       V-299       - Similar to Pixel, except that the length of the virus
                     is 299 Bytes.
                     Origin: Bulgaria
       V-847       - Similar to Pixel, except that the length of the virus
                     is 847 Bytes.
                     Origin: Bulgaria
       V-847B      - Similar to V-847, except that the message in the virus
                     is now in Spanish and is:
                     "=!= En tu PC hay un virus RV1, y esta es su quinta
                     generacion".
                     This variant was originally distributed by a magazine
                     in Spain in file NOCARGAR.COM.

 Virus Name:  Anthrax
 Aliases:
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovery:   July, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM & .EXE growth
 Origin:      Eastern Europe
 Isolated:    Netherlands
 Eff Length:  1040 - 1232 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRAKX - Parasitic Resident .COM, .EXE, & Partition Table Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D + MDisk/P
 General Comments:
       The Anthrax Virus was isolated in July 1990 in the Netherlands after
       it was uploaded onto several BBSes in a trojan anti-viral program,
       USCAN.ZIP.  It is the second virus to be found in a copy of UScan
       during July 1990, the first virus being V2100.  Anthrax is a memory
       resident generic infector of .COM and .EXE files, including
       COMMAND.COM.

       The first time a program infected with the Anthrax virus is executed
       on the system's hard disk, the virus will infect the hard disk's
       partition table.  At this time, it will also install itself memory
       resident.

       Anthrax does not start to infect files immediately.  Instead it will
       sit in memory watching what is occurring on the system.  After some
       pre-defined event occurs, it will then infect one .COM or .EXE file
       each time an infected program is executed.  It appears that the
       pre-determined event is related to the number of keystrokes that
       occur on the system's keyboard.  Programs are selected for infection
       by the virus by infecting the C: drive first, working its way thru
       the directory structure of the drive.

       Programs infected with Anthrax will increase in length by at least
       1,040 bytes.  On the author's test system, the largest increase in
       length experienced was 1,232 bytes.

       The following text strings can be found in files infected with the
       Anthrax virus:

               "(c)Damage, Inc."
               "ANTHRAX"

       It is not known if Anthrax carries any destructive capabilities or
       trigger/activation dates.

       Since Anthrax infects the hard disk partition tables, infected systems
       must have the partition table disinfected or rebuilt in order to
       remove the virus.  This disinfection can be done with either a low-
       level format or use of the MDisk/P program for the correct DOS
       version after powering off and rebooting from a write-protected boot
       diskette for the system.  Any .COM or .EXE files infected with
       Anthrax must also be disinfected or erased.


 Virus Name:  Anti-Pascal
 Aliases:     Anti-Pascal 605 Virus, AP-605, C-605, V605
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovery:   June, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM growth, .BAK and .PAS file corruption
 Origin:      Bulgaria
 Isolated:    Sofia, Bulgaria
 Eff Length:  605 Bytes
 Type Code:   PNCK - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Anti-Pascal Virus, V605 or C-605, was isolated in Sofia,
       Bulgaria in June 1990 by Vesselin Bontchev.  Originally, it was
       thought that the Anti-Pascal virus was from the USSR or Poland,
       but it has since been determined to have been a research virus
       written in Bulgaria over one year before it was isolated.  The
       author was not aware that it had "escaped" until July, 1990.

       The Anti-Pascal Virus is a generic .COM file infector, including
       COMMAND.COM.  While this virus is not memory resident, when it is
       in the process of infecting files, interrupt 21 will be hooked.

       When a program infected with the Anti-Pascal virus is executed,
       the virus will attempt to infect two other .COM files on the
       current drive or on drive D: which are between 605 and 64,930
       bytes in length.  These files must not have the read only
       attribute set.  If an uninfected .COM file meeting the virus's
       selection criteria is found, the first 605 bytes of the program
       is overwritten with the viral code.  The original 605 bytes of
       the program is then appended to the end of the infected file.
       Infected files will have increased in length by 605 bytes, and
       they will also begin with the text string "PQVWS" as well as
       contain the string "COMBAKPAS???EXE" at offset 0x17.  Infected
       files will also have had their file date/time stamps in the
       directory updated to the date/time that the infection occurred.

       If the Anti-Pascal Virus cannot find two .COM files to infect,
       it will check the current drive and directory for .BAK and .PAS
       files.  If these files exist, they will be overwritten with the
       virus's code.  If the overwritten files were .PAS files, the
       system's user has now lost some of their Pascal source code.
       After overwriting .BAK and .PAS files, the virus will attempt to
       rename them to .COM files, or .EXE files if a .COM file already
       exists.  This rename does not work due to a bug in the virus.

       Known variant(s) of the Anti-Pascal Virus are:
       AP-529    : Similar to the 605 byte Anti-Pascal Virus, the major
                   differences are that AP-529 will only infect .COM files
                   over 2,048 bytes in length.  Infected files increase in
                   length by 529 bytes.  Additionally, instead of overwriting
                   the .BAK and .PAS files, one .BAK and .PAS file will be
                   deleted if there are no uninfected .COM files with a
                   length of at least 2,048 bytes on the current drive.
                   .COM files on the C: drive root directory may also be
                   infected by AP-529 when it is executed from the A: or B:
                   drive.  This variant should be considered a "Research
                   Virus", it is not believed to have been publicly
                   released.

 Virus Name:  Anti-Pascal II
 Aliases:     Anti-Pascal 400, AP-400
 V Status:    Research
 Discovery:   June, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM growth; .BAK, .BAT and .PAS file deletion, boot sector
              alteration on hard disk
 Origin:      Bulgaria
 Isolated:    Sofia, Bulgaria
 Eff Length:  400 Bytes
 Type Code:   PNCK - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Anti-Pascal II Virus, or AP-400, was isolated in Sofia,
       Bulgaria in June 1990 by Vesselin Bontchev.  It is one of five
       viruses/variants in the Anti-Pascal family.  Two of the earlier
       variants, Anti-Pascal/AP-605 and AP-529, are documented under
       the name "Anti-Pascal".  The variants listed under Anti-Pascal II
       have been separated due to some of their characteristics differing
       from the 605 byte and 529 byte viruses.

       The Anti-Pascal II Virus is a generic .COM file infector, including
       COMMAND.COM.  While this virus is not memory resident, when it is
       in the process of infecting files, interrupt 21 will be hooked.

       The first time a program infected with the Anti-Pascal II virus is
       executed on a system, the virus will attempt to infect one (1)
       .COM file in the root directory of each drive accessible on the
       system.  Files are only infected if their length is at least 2,048
       bytes, and the resulting infected file will be less than 64K in
       length.  Since COMMAND.COM is usually the first .COM file on a
       drive, it will immediately become infected.  One additional .COM
       file will also be infected on the current drive.  The mechanism used
       to infect the file is to write the virus's code to the end of the
       file.  A jump is used to execute the virus's code before the original
       program is executed.  Infected files do not have their date/time
       stamps in the directory updated to the system date and time when the
       infection occurred.

       If the Anti-Pascal Virus cannot find a .COM file to infect on a
       given drive, or two .COM files to infect on the current drive,
       it will check for the existance of .BAK, .PAS, or .BAT files.  If
       found, these files will be deleted.  These deletions only occur in
       root directories and on the current drive's current directory.  Since
       each root directory (as well as the current directory) will typically
       not have all of its .COM files infected at the same time, the deletes
       will occur on different drives and directories at different times.

       Symptoms of infection of the Anti-Pascal II Virus include file length
       increases of 400 bytes, unexpected disk access to drives other than
       the current drive, and disappearing .BAK, .PAS, and .BAT files.  One
       other symptom of an Anti-Pascal II infection is that the hard disk's
       boot sector will be slightly altered by the virus.  Anti-viral programs
       which CRC-check the boot sector will indicate that a boot sector
       infection may have occurred.  The boot sector alteration does not
       contain a live virus, but will throw the system user off into thinking
       their problem is from a boot sector virus instead of a file infector.

       The Anti-Pascal II Virus and its variants indicated below are not
       believed to have been publicly released.  As such, they have been
       classified as "Research Viruses".

       Known variant(s) of the Anti-Pascal II Virus are:
       AP-440    : Very similar to the 400 byte version of the Anti-Pascal II
                   Virus, the major characteristic change is that this
                   variant has a length of 440 bytes.  This variant is an
                   intermediary between AP-480 and the 400 byte version
                   documented above.
       AP-480    : Similar to the Anti-Pascal II virus, this variant is an
                   earlier version which is 480 bytes in length.  It does not
                   delete .BAT files, but only .BAK and .PAS.  This variant
                   is the earliest variant of the Anti-Pascal II grouping.

 Virus Name:  Armagedon
 Aliases:     Armagedon The First, Armagedon The Greek
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovery:   June, 1990
 Symptoms:    text string intermittently sent to COM ports
 Origin:      Athens, Greece
 Eff Length:  1,079 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRC - Parasitic Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method: ViruScan V64+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Armagedon virus was isolated on June 2, 1990, by George
       Spiliotis of Athens, Greece.  Armagedon is a memory resident
       virus which infects .COM files, increasing their length by 1,079
       bytes.

       The first time an infected program is executed on a system, the
       virus installs itself memory resident, hooking interrupts 8 and 21.
       Any .COM files which are later executed are then infected by the
       resident virus.

       Infected systems will experience the text string "Armagedon the GREEK"
       being sent to COM ports 1 - 4 at time intervals.  Between 5:00 and
       7:00, the virus will attempt to use the system's COM ports to make
       a phone call to Local Time Information in Crete, Greece.  If a
       connection is made, the phone line will remain open until the user
       notices that the phone line is in use.  (Needless to say, this
       doesn't work if the system is located outside of Greece as dialing
       codes are considerably different between countries.)

       This virus otherwise is not destructive.


 Virus Name:  Ashar
 Aliases:     Shoe_Virus, UIUC Virus
 V Status:    Common
 Discovery:
 Symptoms:    BSC, Resident TOM
 Origin:
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   BRt - Resident Boot Sector Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V41+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan 1.4+
 Removal Instructions:  MDisk, CleanUp, Pro-Scan 1.4+, F-Prot or
              DOS SYS command
 General Comments:
       The Ashar virus is a resident boot sector infector which is
       a variant of the Brain virus.  It differs from the Brain
       virus in that it can infect both floppies and hard disk, and
       the message in the virus has been modified to be:

            "VIRUS_SHOE RECORD, v9.0.  Dedicated to the dynamic
            memories of millions of virus who are no longer with us
            today".

       However, the above message is never displayed.  The
       identification string "ashar" is normally found at offset
       04a6 hex in the virus.

       A variant of the Ashar virus exists, Ashar-B or Shoe_Virus-B,
       which has been modified so that it can no longer infect hard
       drives.  The v9.0 in the message has also been altered to v9.1.

 Virus Name:  Brain
 Aliases:     Pakistani, Pakistani Brain
 V Status:    Common
 Discovery:   1986
 Symptoms:    Extended boot time, Volume label change, Resident TOM,
              Three contiguous bad sectors (floppy only), BSC
 Origin:      Pakistan
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   BRt - Resident Boot Sector Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan
 Removal Instructions:  MDisk, CleanUp, F-Prot, Pro-Scan, or DOS SYS command
 General Comments:
       The Pakistani Brain virus originated in Lahore, Pakistan and
       infects disk boot sectors by moving the original contents of the
       boot sector to another location on the disk, marking those 3
       clusters (6 sectors) bad in the FAT, and then writing the virus
       code in the disk boot sector.

       One sign of a disk having been infected, at least with the
       original virus, is that the volume label will will be changed
       to "(c) Brain".  Another sign is that the label "(c) Brain" can
       be found in sector 0 (the boot sector) on an infected disk.

       This virus does install itself resident on infected systems,
       taking up between 3K and 7K of RAM.  The Brain virus is able to
       hide from detection by intercepting any interrupt that might
       interrogate the boot sector and redirecting the read to the
       original boot sector located elsewhere on the disk, thus some
       programs will be unable to see the virus.

       The original Brain virus only infected floppies, however variants
       to the virus can now infect hard disks.  Also, some variants
       have had the "(c) Brain" label removed to make them harder to
       detect.

       Known variants of the Brain virus include:
       Brain-B/Hard Disk Brain/Houston Virus - hard disk version.
       Brain-C - Brain-B with the "(c) Brain" label removed.
       Clone Virus - Brain-C but restores original boot copyright label.
       Clone-B - Clone Virus modified to destroy the FAT after 5/5/92.

 Virus Name:  Cascade
 Aliases:     Fall, Falling Letters, 1701, 1704
 V Status:    Common
 Discovery:   October, 1987
 Symptoms:    TSR, Falling letters, .COM file growth
 Origin:      Germany
 Eff Length:  1,701 or 1,704 bytes
 Type Code:   PRsC - Parasitic Resident Encrypting .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions:  M-1704, CleanUp, F-Prot, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or VirexPC
 General Comments:
       Originally, this virus was a trojan horse which was disguised
       as a program which was supposed to turn off the number-lock
       light when the system was booted.  The trojan horse instead
       caused all the characters on the screen to fall into a pile
       at the bottom of the screen.  In late 1987, the trojan horse
       was changed by someone into a memory resident .COM virus.

       While the original virus had a length of 1,701 bytes and would
       infect both true IBM PCs and clones, a variation exists of
       this virus which is 3 bytes longer than the original virus
       and does not infect true IBM PCs.  Both viruses are
       functionally identical in all other respects.

       Both of the viruses have some fairly unique qualities:  Both
       use an encryption algorithm to avoid detection and complicate
       any attempted analysis of them.  The activation mechanisms
       are based on a sophisticated randomization algorithm
       incorporating machine checks, monitor types, presence or
       absence of a clock card, and the time or season of the year.

       The viruses will activate on any machine with a CGA or VGA
       monitor in the months of September, October, November, or
       December in the years 1980 and 1988.

       Known variants of the Cascade virus are:
       1701-B : Same as 1701, except that it can activate in the
                fall of any year.
       1704-D : Same as the 1704, except that the IBM selection
                has been disabled so that it can infect true IBM
                PCs.
       Cunning: Based on the Cascade virus, a major change to the virus
                is that it now plays music.

 Virus Name:  Cascade-B
 Aliases:     Blackjack, 1704-B
 V Status:    Common
 Discovery:
 Symptoms:    .COM file growth, TSR, random reboots
 Origin:      Germany
 Eff Length:  1,704 bytes
 Type Code:   PRsC - Parasitic Resident Encrypting .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions:  M-1704, M-1704C, CleanUp, F-Prot, Pro-Scan 1.4+,
              VirexPC
 General Comments:
       The Cascade-B virus is similar to the Cascade virus, except
       that the cascading display has been replaced with a system
       reboot which will occur at random time intervals after the
       virus activates.

       Other variation(s) which have been documented are:
       1704-C : Same as 1704-B except that the virus can activate in
                December of any year. (Note: the disinfector for
                1704-C is M-1704C.)


 Virus Name:  Chaos
 Aliases:
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovery:   December, 1989
 Symptoms:    Message, TSR, Bad sectors, BSC
 Origin:      England
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   BR - Resident Boot Sector Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V53+
 Removal Instructions:  MDisk, CleanUp, or DOS SYS Command
 General Comments:
       First reported in December, 1989 by James Berry of Kent,
       England, the Chaos virus is a memory resident boot sector
       infector of floppy and hard disks.

       When the Chaos virus infects a boot sector, it overwrites the
       original boot sector without copying it to another location
       on the disk.  Infected boot sectors will contain the
       following messages:

            "Welcome to the New Dungeon"
            "Chaos"
            "Letz be cool guys"

       The Chaos virus will flag the disk as being full of bad
       sectors upon activation, though most of the supposed bad
       sectors are still readable.  It is unknown what the
       activation criteria is.


 Virus Name:  Christmas Virus
 Aliases:     XA1, 1539

 Symptoms:    .COM file growth, display, Partition table destruction
 Origin:      Germany
 Eff Length:  1,539 Bytes
 Type Code:   PNCX - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V61+, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions:  Scan/D or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Christmas Tree, or XA1, Virus was first isolated in March 1990
       by Christoff Fischer of West Germany.  This virus is an encrypting
       virus which will only infect .COM files.

       On April 1st of any year, the Christmas Tree virus will activate,
       destroying the partition table of infected hard disks the first
       time an infected program is executed.  During the period from
       December 24 until January 1st of any year, when an infected
       program is executed, the virus will display a full screen picture
       of a christmas tree.


 Virus Name:  Dark Avenger
 Aliases:     Black Avenger, Eddie, Diana
 V Status:    Common
 Discovery:   September, 1989
 Symptoms:    TSR; .COM, .EXE, .SYS file growth; File/Disk Corruption
 Origin:      Bulgaria
 Isolated:    Davis, California, USA
 Eff Length:  1,800 bytes
 Type Code:   PRsAK - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V36+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan
 Removal Instructions:  M-DAV, CleanUp, Pro-Scan 1.4+, F-Prot
 General Comments:
       Dark Avenger was first isolated in the United States at the University
       of California at Davis.  It infects .COM, .EXE, and overlay files,
       including COMMAND.COM.  The virus will install itself into system
       memory, becoming resident, and is extremely prolific at infecting
       any executable files that are openned for any reason.  This includes
       using the DOS COPY and XCOPY commands to copy uninfected files, both
       the source and the target files will end up being infected.  Infected
       files will have their lengths increased by 1,800 bytes.

       The Dark Avenger Virus does perform malicious damage.  The virus
       maintains a counter in the disk's boot sector.  After each sixteenth
       file is infected, the virus will randomly overwrite a sector on the
       disk with a copy of the disk's boot sector.  If the randomly
       selected sector is a portion of a program or datafile, the program
       or datafile will be corrupted.  Programs and datafiles which have
       been corrupted by a sector being overwritten are permanently
       damaged and cannot be repaired since the original sector is lost.

       If you are infected with Dark Avenger, shutdown your computer
       and reboot from a Write Protected boot diskette for the system,
       then carefully use a disinfector, following all instructions.
       Be sure to rescan the system for infection once you have finished
       disinfecting it.

       The Dark Avenger virus contains the words: "The Dark Avenger,
       copyright 1988, 1989", as well as the message: "This program
       was written in the city of Sofia.  Eddie lives.... Somewhere in
       Time!".

       This virus bears no resemblance or similarity to the Jerusalem
       viruses, even though they are similar in size.

 Symptoms:    .COM file growth, floppy disk access; formats
              hard disk, message any day from Oct 13 to Dec 31.
 Origin:      Holland
 Eff Length:  1,168 bytes
 Type Code:   PNC - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions:  AntiCrim, Scan/D, Pro-Scan 1.4+, VirexPC, or F-Prot
 General Comments:
       The Datacrime virus is a parasitic virus, and is also known as
       the 1168 virus.  The Datacrime virus is a non-resident
       virus, infecting .COM files.  The virus was originally
       discovered in Europe shortly after its release in March, 1989.

       The virus will attach itself to the end of a .COM file, increasing
       the file's length by 1168 bytes.  The first 5 bytes of the host
       program are stored off in the virus's code and then replaced by
       a branch instruction so that the virus code will be executed
       before the host program.  In order to propagate, the virus
       searches thru directories for .COM files, other than
       COMMAND.COM and attaches to any found .COM files (except for
       where the 7th letter is a D).  Hard drive partitions are
       searched before the floppy drives are checked.  The virus will
       continue to propagate until the date is after October 12 of any
       year, then when it is executed it will display a message.  The
       de-crypted message is something like:

                 "DATACRIME VIRUS"
                 "RELEASED: 1 MARCH 1989".

       Note: only this ASCII message is encrypted in this version.

       A low-level format of the hard disk is then done.

       Errors in the code will make .COM file infection appear random
       and will often make the system crash following infection.

       Unlike the other variants of Datacrime, the original Datacrime
       virus does not replicate, or infect files, until after April 1
       of any year.

       Lastly, if the computer system is using an RLL, SCSI, or PC/AT
       type hard disk controller, all variants of the Datacrime virus
       are not able to successfully format the hard disk, according
       to Jan Terpstra of the Netherlands.

 General Comments:
       The Datacrime-B virus is a variant of the Datacrime virus, the
       differences being that the effective length of the virus is
       1,280 bytes, and instead of infecting .COM files, .EXE files
       are infected.

 Virus Name:  dBASE
 Aliases:     DBF Virus
 V Status:    Endangered
 Discovered:  September, 1988
 Symptoms:    .COM & .OVL file growth, corrupt .DBF files, TSR, FAT and root
              directory overwritten
 Origin:      New York, USA
 Eff Length:  1,864 bytes
 Type Code:   PRC - Parasitic Resident .COM and Overlay Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V47+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or F-Prot
 General Comments:
       The dBASE virus was discovered by Ross Greenberg of New York.
       This virus infects .COM & .OVL files, and will corrupt data in
       .DBF files by randomly transposing bytes in any open .DBF file.
       It keeps track of which files and bytes were transposed in a
       hidden file (BUG.DAT) in the same directory as the .DBF file(s).
       The virus restores these bytes if the file is read, so it
       appears that nothing is wrong.  Once the BUG.DAT file is 90
       days old or more, the virus will overwrite the FAT and root
       directory on the disk.

       After this virus has been detected, if you remove the infected
       dBASE program and replace it with a clean copy, your DBF files
       that were openned during the period that you were infected
       will be useless since they are garbled on the disk even
       though they would be displayed as expected by the infected
       dBASE program.


 Virus Name:  Den Zuk
 Aliases:     Search, Venezuelan
 V Status:    Common
 Discovered:  September, 1988
 Symptoms:    Message, floppy format, TSR, BSC
 Origin:      Indonesia
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   RtF - Resident Floppy Boot Sector Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: MDisk, CleanUp, F-Prot, Pro-Scan 1.4+,
              or DOS SYS command
 General Comments:
       The Den Zuk virus is a memory-resident, boot sector infector of
       360K 5 1/4" diskettes.  The virus can infect any diskette
       in a floppy drive that is accessed, even if the diskette is
       not bootable.  If an attempt is made to boot the system with an
       infected non-system disk, Den Zuk will install itself into
       memory even though the boot failed.  After the system is booted
       with an infected diskette, a purple "DEN ZUK" graphic will appear
       after a CTL-ALT-DEL is performed if the system has a CGA, EGA, or
       VGA monitor.  While the original Den Zuk virus did not cause any
       damage to the system, some variants maintain a counter of how
       many times the system has been rebooted, and after the counter
       reaches its limit, the floppy in the disk drive is reformatted.
       The counter in these variants of the virus is usually in the
       range of 5 to 10.

       The following text strings can be found in the viral code on
       diskettes which have been infected with the Den Zuk virus:

                 "Welcome to the
                     C l u b
                  --The HackerS--
                      Hackin'
                   All The Time

                   The HackerS"

       The diskette volume label of infected diskettes may be changed
       to Y.C.1.E.R.P., though this change only occurs if the Den Zuk
       virus removed a Pakistani Brain infection before infecting the
       diskette with Den Zuk.  The Den Zuk virus will also remove
       an Ohio virus infection before infecting the diskette with
       Den Zuk.

       The Den Zuk virus is thought to be written by the same person
       or persons as the Ohio virus.  The "Y.C.1.E.R.P." string is
       found in the Ohio virus, and the viral code is similar in
       many respects.

 Virus Name:  Devil's Dance
 Aliases:     Mexican
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  December, 1989
 Symptoms:    Message, .COM growth, FAT corruption, TSR
 Origin:      Mexico
 Eff Length:  941 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRCT - Parasitic Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V52+, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Devil's Dance virus was first isolated in December, 1989,
       by Mao Fragoso of Mexico City.  The Devil's Dance virus
       increases the size of infected .COM files by 941 bytes, and
       will infect a file multiple times until the file becomes too
       large to fit in available system memory.

       Once an infected program has been run, any subsequent warm-
       reboot (CTL-ALT-DEL) will result in the following message
       being displayed:

       "DID YOU EVER DANCE WITH THE DEVIL IN THE WEAK MOONLIGHT?
                            PRAY FOR YOUR DISKS!!
                                The Joker"

       The Devil's Dance virus is destructive.  After the first 2,000
       keystrokes, the virus starts changing the colors of any text
       displayed on the system monitor.  After the first 5,000
       keystrokes, the virus erases the first copy of the FAT.  At
       this point, when the system is rebooted, it will display the
       message above and again destroy the first copy of the FAT, then
       allow the boot to proceed.


 Virus Name:  Disk Killer
 Aliases:     Computer Ogre, Disk Ogre, Ogre
 V Status:    Common
 Discovered:  April, 1989
 Symptoms:    Bad blocks, message, BSC, TSR, encryption of disk
 Origin:      Taiwan
 Isolated:    Milpitas, California, USA
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   BRtT - Resident Boot Sector Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V39+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions:  MDisk, CleanUp, Pro-Scan 1.4+, F-Prot, or
              DOS COPY & SYS
 General Comments:
       The Disk Killer virus is a boot sector infector that spreads by
       writing copies of itself to 3 blocks on either a floppy or
       hard disk.  The virus does not care if these blocks are in use
       by another program or are part of a file.  These blocks will then
       be marked as bad in the FAT so that they cannot be overwritten.
       The boot sector is patched so that when the system is booted, the
       virus code will be executed and it can attempt to infect any new
       disks exposed to the system.

       The virus keeps track of the elasped disk usage time since initial
       infection, and does no harm until it has reached a predetermined
       limit.  The predetermined limit is approximately 48 hours.  (On
       most systems, Disk Killer will reach its limit within 1 - 6
       weeks of its initial hard disk infection.)

       When the limit is reached or exceeded and the system is rebooted,
       a message is displayed identifying COMPUTER OGRE and a date of
       April 1.  It then says to leave alone and proceeds to encrypt the
       disk by alternately XORing sectors with 0AAAAh and 05555h,
       effectively destroying the information on the disk.  The only recourse
       after Disk Killer has activated and encrypted the entire disk is to
       reformat.

       The message text that is displayed upon activation, and can be found
       in the viral code is:

         "Disk Killer -- Version 1.00 by COMPUTER OGRE 04/01/89

                                Warning!!

          Don't turn off the power or remove the diskette while Disk Killer is
          Processing!

                                PROCESSING

          Now you can turn off the power.  I wish you Luck!"

       It is important to note that when the message is displayed, if the
       system is turned off immediately it may be possible to salvage
       some files on the disk using various utility programs as this
       virus first destroys the boot, FAT, and directory blocks.

       Disk Killer can be removed by using McAfee Associate's MDisk or
       CleanUp utility, or the DOS SYS command, to overwrite the boot
       sector on hard disks or bootable floppies.  On non-system floppies,
       files can be copied to non-infected floppies, followed by reformat-
       ting the infected floppies.  Be sure to reboot the system from a
       write protected master diskette before attempting to remove the
       virus first or you will be reinfected by the virus in memory.

       Note: Disk Killer may have damaged one or more files on the disk
       when it wrote a portion of its viral code to 3 blocks on the disk.
       Once the boot sector has been disinfected as indicated above, these
       corrupted files cannot reinfect the system, however they should be
       replaced with backup copies since the 3 blocks were overwritten.

       Note: Do not use the DOS DiskCopy program to backup infected
       diskettes as the new backup diskettes will contain the virus
       as well.


 Virus Name:  Do-Nothing Virus
 Aliases:     The Stupid Virus
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  October, 1989
 Symptoms:    .COM file growth, TSR (see text)
 Origin:      Israel
 Eff Length:  608 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRfC - Parasitic Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V49+, F-Prot, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or F-Prot
 General Comments:
       This virus was first reported by Yuval Tal of Israel in
       October, 1989.  The virus will infect .COM files, but only the
       first one in the current directory, whether it was previously
       infected or not.  The Do-Nothing virus is also memory
       resident, always installing itself to memory address
       9800:100h, and can only infect systems with 640K of memory.
       The virus does not protect this area of memory in any way,
       and other programs which use this area will overwrite it in
       memory, removing the program from being memory resident.

       The Do-Nothing virus does no apparent damage, nor does it
       affect operation of the system in any observable way, thus
       its name.


 Virus Name:  EDV
 Aliases:     Stealth Virus
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  January, 1990
 Symptoms:    BSC, TSR, unusual crashes
 Origin:
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   BRX - Resident Boot Sector/Partition Table Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V58+, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan 1.4+
 Removal Instructions:  MDisk/P, or Pro-Scan 1.4+
 General Comments:
       The EDV virus first identified in January, 1990.  This virus infects
       the boot sector of floppy diskettes, as well as the boot sector and
       partition table of hard disks.  After a system is booted from an
       infected diskette or hard disk, the virus makes itself memory
       resident.

       The EDV virus will cause some programs to crash, as well as
       destroying some data.

       The following identification string appears at the very end of the
       boot sector on infected floppy disks:

            "MSDOS Vers. E.D.V."


 Virus Name:  Eight Tunes
 Aliases:     1971
 V Status:    Rare

 Symptoms:    file growth, music, decrease in available memory
 Origin:      West Germany
 Eff Length:  1,971 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRsA - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V62+, Pro-Scan 1.4+, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Eight Tunes, or 1971, Virus was originally isolated in April
       1990 by Fridrik Skulason of Iceland.  This virus is a memory resident
       generic file infector of .COM, .EXE, and overlay files.  The virus will
       not infect COMMAND.COM, or .COM files which are smaller than 8K.
       After the virus is memory resident, programs are infected as they
       are executed.  Infected files will increase in length by between
       1,971 - 1,985 bytes.

       Available memory will decrease by 1,984 bytes when the virus is
       present.

       This virus does not cause system damage, however it is disruptive.
       When the virus is memory resident, it will play 8 German folk songs
       at random intervals thirty minutes after the virus becomes memory
       resident.


 Virus Name:  Fellowship
 Aliases:     1022
 V Status:    New
 Discovered:  July, 1990
 Symptoms:    TSR, .COM & .EXE file growth
 Origin:      West Germany
 Eff Length:  1,022 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRsE - Parasitic Resident .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Fellowship or 1022 Virus was isolated in Australia in July 1990.
       Fellowship is a memory resident generic infector of .EXE files.  It
       does not infect .COM or overlay files.

       The first time a program infected with the Fellowship Virus is
       executed, the virus will install itself memory resident as a 2,048
       byte TSR in low system memory.  Available free memory will be decreased
       by a corresponding 2,048 bytes.  Interrupt 21 will also now be
       controlled by the virus.

       After the virus is memory resident, the virus will infect .EXE files
       when they are executed.  Infected .EXE files will increase in size
       by between 1,019 and 1,027 bytes.  The virus's code will be located
       at the end of infected files.

       Infected files will contain the following text strings very close to
       the end of the file:

             "This message is dedicated to
              all fellow PC users on Earth
              Toward A Better Tomorrow

 Virus Name:  Fish Virus
 Aliases:     European Fish Viruses, Fish 6, Stealth Virus
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  May 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM & .EXE growth, monitor/display flickering, system
              memory decrease
 Origin:      West Germany
 Eff Length:  3,584  Bytes
 Type Code:   PRsAK - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V63+, Pro-Scan 1.4+, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, CleanUp V66+, Pro-Scan 1.4+,
              or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Fish Virus was isolated in May 1990.  At the time of isolation,
       it was reported to be widespread in Europe, and it is thought to
       have originated in West Germany.  It is a generic resident .COM
       and .EXE infector, and will infect COMMAND.COM.  This virus will
       remain memory resident thru a warm reboot, or Ctrl-Alt-Del.  The
       virus is encrypted, though infected programs can be found by
       searching for the text string "FISH FI" appearing near the end of
       the program.  The "FISH FI" string may later disappear from the
       program.

       The first time a program infected with the Fish Virus is executed,
       the virus will go memory resident, installing itself into the low
       available free memory.  If interrupt 13 has not been hooked by
       another program, it will hook interrupt 13.  If it can hook
       interrupt 13, it will take up 8,192 bytes in memory.  If the virus
       cannot hook interrupt 13 because another program is already using it,
       it will be 4,096 bytes in memory.

       When interrupt 13 is not hooked, and the virus is memory resident,
       the virus will cause a random warm reboot, thus allowing it to
       infect COMMAND.COM and hook interrupt 13.  Warm reboots do not
       appear to randomly occur after interrupt 13 has been hooked.

       After the virus is memory resident, all .COM and .EXE programs which
       are openned for any reason will be infected.  Infected programs
       increase in length by 3,584 bytes.  The increase in program size
       cannot be seen by listing the disk directory if the virus is in
       memory.  Also, if a CHKDSK command is run on an infected system,
       it will detect file allocation errors on infected files.  If CHKDSK
       is run with the /F option, it will result in lost clusters and
       cross-linking of files.

       The virus slows down video writes, and flickering of the monitor
       display can be noticed on an infected system.

       Anti-viral programs which perform CRC checking cannot detect the
       infection of the program by the Fish Virus if the virus is memory
       resident.  This virus can also bypass software write protect
       mechanisms used to protect a hard drive.

       The Fish Virus is a modified version of the 4096 Virus, though it is
       more sophisticated in that it constantly re-encrypts itself in
       system memory.  Viewing system memory with the virus resident will
       show that the names of several fish are present.

       It is unknown what the Fish virus does when it activates, though it
       does appear to check to determine if the year of the system time is
       1991.


 Virus Name:  Flash
 Aliases:
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  July 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM & .EXE growth, decrease in available free memory
 Origin:
 Eff Length:  688  Bytes
 Type Code:   PRfA - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V64+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Flash Virus was discovered in July 1990 in West Germany.  Flash
       is a memory resident generic file infector, and will infect .COM and
       .EXE files, but not COMMAND.COM.

       The first time a program infected with the Flash Virus is executed,
       the virus will install itself memory resident.   976 bytes will be
       allocated in high memory, and available free memory will decrease by
       a corresponding 976 bytes.  A mapping of memory will also indicate
       that when Flash is resident in memory, interrupts 00, 23, 24, 30,
       ED, F5, and FB are now in free memory.  Total system memory reported
       by DOS, as well as low memory used by the operating system and TSRs
       will not have changed.

       Once Flash is memory resident, each time a .COM or .EXE program is
       executed it is a candidate for infection.  An uninfected .EXE program
       will always be infected upon execution.  Uninfected .COM files are
       only infected if they are greater than approximately 500 bytes in
       length.  Infected files will always increase in length by 688 bytes.


 Virus Name:  Flip
 Aliases:
 V Status:    New
 Discovered:  July 1990

              boot sector and partition table altered, file allocation errors
 Origin:      West Germany
 Eff Length:  2,343  Bytes
 Type Code:   PRhA - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Flip Virus was discovered in West Germany in July 1990.  It is
       a generic file infector, and will infect .COM, .EXE, and overlay files.
       This virus will also infect COMMAND.COM, as well as alter the partition
       table and boot sector of hard disks.

       The first time a program infected with the Flip Virus is executed, it
       installs itself memory resident in high memory.  System memory as
       reported by the CHKDSK command as well as free memory will have
       decreased by 3,064 bytes.  At this time, the copy of COMMAND.COM
       located in the C: drive root directory will be infected, though no
       file length change will be apparent with the virus in memory.  The
       system's hard disk partition table and boot sector will also be
       slightly modified.  If the infected program was executed from a
       floppy, COMMAND.COM on the floppy will be infected, though the size
       change will be noticeable.

       After Flip becomes memory resident, any .COM or .EXE files executed
       will become infected.  Infected programs will show a file length
       increase of 2,343 bytes.  If a program is executed which uses an
       overlay file, the overlay file will also become infected.

       Systems infected Flip may experience file allocation errors resulting
       in file linkage errors.  Some data files may become corrupted.


 Virus Name:  FORM-Virus

 Symptoms:    BSC
 Origin:      Switzerland
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   BR - Resident Boot Sector Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V64+
 Removal Instructions: MDisk, or DOS SYS command
 General Comments:
       The Form, or Form Boot, Virus is a memory resident infector of
       floppy and hard disk boot sectors.  It was originally isolated in
       Switzerland.

       When a system is first booted with a diskette infected with the
       Form Boot virus, the virus will infect system memory as well as
       seek out and infect the system's hard disk.  The floppy boot may
       or may not be successful, on the author's test system, a boot
       from floppy diskette infected with Form Boot never succeeded,
       instead the system would hang.  It should be noted that the virus
       was received by the author of this document as a binary file, and
       it may have been damaged in some way.

       The following text message is contained in the Form Boot virus binary
       code as received by the author of this document:

            "The FORM-Virus sends greetings to everyone who's reading
             this text.FORM doesn't destroy data! Don't panic! Fuckings
             go to Corinne."

       These messages, however, may not appear in all cases.  For example,
       I did not find these messages anywhere on a hard disk infected with
       Form Boot.

       This virus can be removed with the same technique as used with many
       boot sector infectors.  First, power off the system and then boot
       from a known clean write-protected boot diskette.  The DOS SYS
       command can then be used to recreate the boot sector.  Alternately,
       MDisk from McAfee Associates may be used to recreate the boot
       sector.


 Virus Name:  Frere Jacques
 Aliases:     Frere Virus
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  May 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM & .EXE growth, available memory decreases, system hangs,
              music (Frere Jacques) on Fridays
 Origin:      California, USA
 Eff Length:  1,808 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRA - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V63+, Pro-Scan 1.4+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Frere Jacques Virus was isolated in May, 1990.  It is a memory
       resident generic file infector, infecting .COM, .EXE, and Overlay
       files.  It does not infect COMMAND.COM.  This virus is based on
       the Jerusalem B Virus.

       The first time an infected program is executed, the virus will
       install itself memory resident in low available free memory.
       The memory resident virus occupies 2,064 bytes, and attaches itself
       to interrupt 21.  After becoming memory resident, Frere Jacques will
       infect any program which is then executed.  Infected programs will
       increase in size by between 1,808 bytes and 1,819 bytes, though
       .COM files always increase in size by 1,813 bytes.

       Systems infected with Frere Jacques will experience a decrease in
       available free memory, as well as executable files increasing in
       size.  System hangs will also intermittently occur when the virus
       attempts to infect programs, thus resulting in the possible loss
       of system data.

       On Fridays, the Frere Jacques virus activates, and will play the
       tune Frere Jacques on the system speaker.

 Virus Name:  Friday The 13th COM Virus
 Aliases:     COM Virus, Miami, Munich, South African, 512 Virus
 V Status:    Endangered
 Discovered:  November, 1987
 Symptoms:    .COM growth, floppy disk access, file deletion
 Origin:      Republic of South Africa
 Eff Length:  512 Bytes
 Type Code:   PNC - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or F-Prot
 General Comments:
       The original Friday The 13th COM virus first appeared in
       South Africa in 1987.  Unlike the Jerusalem (Friday The 13th)
       viruses, it is not memory resident, nor does it hook any
       interrupts.  This virus only infects .COM files, but not
       COMMAND.COM.  On each execution of an infected file, the
       virus looks for two other .COM files on the C drive and 1
       on the A drive, if found they are infected.  This virus is
       extremely fast, and the only indication of propagation occurring
       is the access light being on for the A drive, if the current
       default drive is C.  The virus will only infect a .COM file
       once.  The files, after infection, must be less than 64K in
       length.

       On every Friday the 13th, if the host program is executed, it
       is deleted.

       Known variants of the Friday The 13th COM virus are:
       Friday The 13th-B: same, except that it will infect every
            file in the current subdirectory or in the system path if
            the infected .COM program is in the system path.
       Friday The 13th-C: same as Friday The 13th-B, except that the
            message "We hope we haven't inconvenienced you" is
            displayed whenever the virus activates.

       Author's note: All samples of this virus that are available were
       created by reassembling a disassembly of this virus.  These viruses
       may not actually exist "in the wild".


 Virus Name:  Fu Manchu
 Aliases:     2080, 2086
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  March, 1988
 Symptoms:    .SYS, .BIN, .COM & .EXE growth, messages
 Origin:
 Eff Length:  2,086 (COM files) & 2,080 (EXE files) bytes
 Type Code:   PRsA - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, F-Prot, Pro-Scan 1.4+, VirexPC
 General Comments:
       The Fu Manchu virus attaches itself to the beginning of .COM
       files or the end of .EXE files.  This virus will infect any
       executable program, including overlay, .SYS, and .BIN files
       as well.  It appears to be a rewritten version of the Jerusalem
       virus, with a possible creation date of 3/10/88.

       A marker or id string usually found in this virus is
       'sAXrEMHOr', though the virus only uses the 'rEMHOr' portion
       of the string to identify infected files.

       One out of sixteen infections will result in a timer being
       installed, and after a random amount of time, the message
       "The world will hear from me again!" is displayed and
       the system reboots.  This message will also be displayed on
       an infected system after a warm reboot, though the virus doesn't
       survive in memory.

       After August 1, 1989, the virus will monitor the keyboard buffer,
       and will add derogatory comments to the names of various
       politicians.  These comments go to the keyboard buffer, so
       their effect is not limited to the display.  The messages within
       the virus are encrypted.

       This virus is very rare in the United States.

 Virus Name:  Ghostballs
 Aliases:     Ghost Boot, Ghost COM
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  October, 1989
 Symptoms:    moving graphic display, .COM file growth, file corruption, BSC.
 Origin:      Iceland
 Eff Length:  2,351 bytes
 Type Code:   PNCB - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM & Boot Sector Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V46+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: MDisk or DOS SYS and erase infected .COM files,
       or CleanUp, F-Prot, Pro-Scan 1.4+, VirexPC
 General Comments:
       The Ghostball virus (Ghost Boot and Ghost COM) were discovered in
       October, 1989 by Fridrik Skulason of Iceland.  The Ghostballs Virus
       virus infects generic .COM files, increasing the file size by
       2,351 bytes.  It also alters the disk boot sector, replacing it
       with viral code similar to the Ping Pong virus.  This altered
       boot sector, however, will not replicate.

       Symptoms of this virus are very similar to the Ping Pong
       virus, and random file corruption may occur on infected
       systems.

       The Ghostballs virus was the first known virus that could infect
       both files (.COM files in this case) and disk boot sectors.
       After the boot sector is infected, the system experiences the
       bouncing ball effect of the Ping Pong virus.  If the boot sector
       is overwritten to remove the boot viral infection, it will again
       become corrupted the next time an infected .COM file is executed.

       The Ghostballs Virus is based on the code of two other viruses.
       The .COM infector portion consists of a modified version of the
       Vienna virus.  The boot sector portion of the virus is based on
       the Ping Pong virus.

       To remove this virus, turn off the computer and reboot from
       a write protected master diskette for the system.  Then
       use either MDisk or the DOS SYS command to replace the boot
       sector on the infected disk.  Any infected .COM files must
       also be erased and deleted, then replaced with clean copies
       from your original distribution diskettes.


 Virus Name:  Golden Gate
 Aliases:     Mazatlan, 500 Virus
 V Status:    Extinct
 Discovered:  1988
 Symptoms:    BSC, disk format, Resident TOM
 Origin:      California, USA
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   BRt - Resident Boot Sector Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan (identifies as Alameda)
 Removal Instructions: MDisk, F-Prot, or DOS SYS command
 General Comments:
       The Golden Gate virus is a modified version of the Alameda virus
       which activates when the counter in the virus has determined
       that it is infected 500 diskettes.  The virus replicates when
       a CTL-ALT-DEL is performed, infecting any diskette in the floppy
       drive.  Upon activation, the C: drive is formatted.  The
       counter in the virus is reset on each new floppy or hard drive
       infected.

       Known Variants of this virus are:
       Golden Gate-B: same as Golden Gate, except that the counter
           has been changed from 500 to 30 infections before
           activation, and only diskettes are infected.
       Golden Gate-C: same as Golden Gate-B, except that the hard
           drive can also be infected.  This variant is also known
           as the Mazatlan Virus, and is the most dangerous of the
           Golden Gate viruses.

 Virus Name:  Halloechen
 Aliases:
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  October, 1989
 Symptoms:    TSR, .COM & .EXE growth, garbled keyboard input.
 Origin:      West Germany
 Eff Length:  2,011 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRsA - Resident Parasitic .COM &.EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V57+, Pro-Scan 1.4+, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Halloechen virus was reported by Christoff Fischer of
       the University of Karlsruhe in West Germany.  The virus is
       a memory resident generic .COM & .EXE file infector which is
       reported to be widespread in West Germany.

       The Halloechen virus installs itself memory resident when the
       first infected program is executed.  Thereafter, the virus will
       infect any .EXE or .COM file which is run unless the resulting
       infected file would be greater than 64K in size, or the file's
       date falls within the system date's current month and year.
       Once a file has been determined to be a candidate for infection,
       and is less than approximately 62K in size as well as having a
       date outside of the current month and year, it is infected.
       In the process of infecting the file, the files size is first
       increased so that it is a multiple of 16 (ends on a paragraph
       boundary), then the 2,011 bytes of viral code are added.

       When infected files are run, input from the keyboard is garbled.


 Virus Name:  Holland Girl
 Aliases:     Sylvia
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  December, 1989
 Symptoms:    .COM growth, TSR
 Origin:      Netherlands
 Eff Length:  1,332 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRsC - Resident Parasitic .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V50+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: F-Prot, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or Scan/D
 General Comments:
       The Holland Girl or Sylvia Virus was first reported by Jan
       Terpstra of the Netherlands.  This virus is memory resident
       and infects only .COM files, increasing their size by 1,332
       bytes.  The virus apparently does no other damage, and
       does not infect COMMAND.COM.

       The virus's name is due to the fact that the virus code
       contains the name and phone number of a girl named Sylvia
       in Holland, along with her address, requesting that post cards
       be sent to her.  The virus is believed to have been written
       by her ex-boyfriend.


 Virus Name:  Icelandic
 Aliases:     656, One In Ten, Disk Crunching Virus
 V Status:    Extinct
 Discovered:  June, 1989
 Symptoms:    .EXE growth, Resident TOM, bad sectors, FAT corruption
 Origin:      Iceland
 Eff Length:  656 bytes
 Type Code:   PRfE - Resident Parasitic .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, F-Prot, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or F-Prot
 General Comments:
       The Icelandic, or "Disk Crunching Virus", was originally
       isolated in Iceland in June 1989.  This virus only infects
       .EXE files, with infected files growing in length between
       656 and 671 bytes.  File lengths after infection will always
       be a multiple of 16.  The virus attaches itself to the end
       of the programs it infects, and infected files will always
       end with hex '4418,5F19'.

       The Icelandic virus will copy itself to the top of free memory
       the first time an infected program is executed.  Once in high
       memory, it hides from memory mapping programs.  If a program
       later tries to write to this area of memory, the computer will
       crash.  If the virus finds that some other program has "hooked"
       Interrupt 13, it will not proceed to infect programs.  If
       Interrupt 13 has not been "hooked", it will attempt to infect
       every 10th program executed.

       On systems with only floppy drives, or 10 MB hard disks, the
       virus will not cause any damage.  However, on systems with
       hard disks larger than 10 MB, the virus will select one unused
       FAT entry and mark the entry as a bad sector each time it
       infects a program.

 Virus Name:  Icelandic-II
 Aliases:     System Virus, One In Ten
 V Status:    Extinct
 Discovered:  July, 1989
 Symptoms:    .EXE growth, Resident TOM, FAT corruption
              date changes, loss of Read-Only
 Origin:      Iceland
 Eff Length:  632 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRfE - Parasitic Resident .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or F-Prot
 General Comments:
       The Icelandic-II Virus is a modified version of the Icelandic
       Virus, and was isolated for the first time in July 1989 in
       Iceland.  These two viruses are very similar, so only the
       changes to this variant are indicated here, refer to Icelandic
       for the base virus information.

       Each time the Icelandic-II virus infects a program, it will
       modify the file's date, thus making it fairly obvious that
       the program has been changed.  The virus will also remove
       the read-only attribute from files, but does not restore it
       after infecting the program.

       The Icelandic-II virus can infect programs even if the system
       is running an anti-viral TSR that monitors interrupt 21, such
       as FluShot+.

       On hard disks larger than 10 MB, there are no bad sectors
       marked in the FAT as there is with the Icelandic virus.

 Discovered:  December, 1989
 Symptoms:    .EXE growth, Resident TOM, bad sectors, FAT corruption,
              Dec 24 message.
 Origin:      Iceland
 Eff Length:  853 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRfE - Parasitic Resident .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V57+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: F-Prot, Scan/D, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Icelandic-III Virus is a modified version of the Icelandic
       Virus, and was isolated for the first time in December 1989 in
       Iceland.  These two viruses are very similar, so only the
       changes to this variant are indicated here, refer to Icelandic
       for the base virus information.

       The Icelandic-III virus's id string in the last 2 words of the
       program is hex '1844,195F', the bytes in each word being
       reversed from the id string ending the Icelandic and
       Icelandic-II viruses.  There are also other minor changes to
       the virus from the previous Icelandic viruses, including the
       addition of several NOP instructions.

       Before the virus will infect a program, it checks to see if the
       program has been previously infected with Icelandic or
       Icelandic-II, if it has, it does not infect the program.
       Files infected with the Icelandic-III virus will have their
       length increased by between 848 and 863 bytes.

       If an infected program is run on December 24th of any year,
       programs subsequently run will be stopped, later displaying
       the message "Gledileg jol" ("Merry Christmas" in Icelandic)
       instead.

 Virus Name:  Itavir
 Aliases:     3880
 V Status:    Endangered
 Discovered:  March, 1990
 Symptoms:    .EXE growth, .OMMAND.COM file, Boot sector corruption
 Origin:      Italy
 Eff Length:  3,880 Bytes
 Type Code:   PNE - Parasitic Non-Resident .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V60+, Pro-Scan 1.4+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Itavir virus was isolated in March 1990 by a group of
       students at the Milan Politechnic in Milan, Italy.  The Itavir
       virus is a non-resident generic .EXE Infector.  Infected files
       will increase in length by 3,880 bytes.  Infected systems,
       besides having files which have increased in length, will
       usually have a file with the name .OMMAND.COM somewhere on
       the disk.  The first character of this file name is an
       unprintable character.  The .OMMAND.COM file contains the
       pure virus code and is used for appending to files as they
       are infected.

       The Itavir virus activates at some time periood after the system
       has been running for more than 24 hours.  When it activates, the
       boot sector is corrupted, rendering the system unbootable.  The
       virus also displays a message in Italian and writes ansi values
       from 0 thru 255 to all available I/O ports, thus confusing any
       attached peripheral devices.  Some monitors may show a flickering
       effect when this occurs, while some VGA monitors may actually
       "hiss".

 Removal Instructions:  Scan/D/A, Saturday, CleanUp, UnVirus, F-Prot,
              VirexPC 1.1+, Pro-Scan 1.4+
 General Comments:
       The Jerusalem Virus was originally isolated at Hebrew
       University in Israel in the Fall of 1987.  The virus is
       memory resident and can survive a warm reboot (CTL-ALT-DEL).
       .COM and .EXE files are infected, with .EXE files being
       reinfected each time they are executed due to a bug in the
       virus.

       This virus redirects interrupt 8, and 1/2 hour after execution
       of an infected program the system will slow down by a factor
       of 10.  Additionally, some Jerusalem Virus variants will have a
       "Black Window" or "Black Box" appear on the lower left side of
       the screen which will scroll up the screen as the screen scrolls.

       On Friday The 13ths, after the virus is installed in memory,
       every program executed will be deleted from disk.

       The identifier for some strains is "sUMsDos", however,
       this identifier is usually not found in the newer variants of
       Jerusalem.

       The Jerusalem Virus is thought to have been based on the Suriv 3.00
       Virus, though the Suriv 3.00 Virus was isolated after the Jerusalem
       Virus.

 Symptoms:    TSR, .EXE & .COM growth, system slowdown, deleted files
              on Friday 13th, "Black WIndow"
 Origin:      Israel
 Eff Length:  1,813 (.COM files) & 1,808 (.EXE files) bytes

 Removal Instructions:  F-Prot, Saturday, CleanUp, M-JRUSLM, UnVirus,
              VirexPC 1.1+, Pro-Scan 1.4+
 General Comments:
       Identical to the Jerusalem virus, except that in some cases
       it does not reinfect .EXE files.  Jerusalem B is the most
       common of all PC viruses, and can infect .SYS and program
       overlay files in addition to .COM and .EXE files.

       Not all variants of the Jerusalem B virus slow down the
       system after an infection has occurred.

       Known variants of Jerusalem B are:
       A-204      : Jerusalem B with the sUMsDos text string changed to
           *A-204*, and a couple of instructions changed in order to
           avoid detection.  This variant will slow down the system
           after being memory resident for 30 minutes, as well as having
           a black box appear at that time.
           Origin: Delft, The Netherlands
       Anarkia    : Jerusalem B with the timer delay set to slow
           down the system to a greater degree, though this effect
           doesn't show until a much longer time has elasped.  No
           Black Box is never displayed.  The sUMsDos id-string has
           been changed to ANARKIA.  Lastly, the virus's activation
           date has been changed to Tuesday The 13ths, instead of
           Friday The 13ths.  Origin: Spain
       Anarkia-B  : Similar to Anarkia, with the exception that the
           virus now activates on any October 12th instead of on
           Tuesday The 13ths.
       Jerusalem-C: Jerusalem B without the timer delay to slow
           down the processor.
       Jerusalem-D: Jerusalem C which will destroy both copies of
           the FAT on any Friday The 13th after 1990.
       Jerusalem-E: Jerusalem D but the activation is in 1992.
       Mendoza    : Based on the Jerusalem B virus, this variant does
           not reinfect .EXE files.  It is also missing the black box
           effect.  Mendoza activates in the second half of the year
           (July - December), at which time any day will have a 10%
           chance of having all programs executed deleted.
           Origin: Argentina
       Puerto  : Isolated in June, 1990 in Puerto Rico, this variant is
           very similar to the Mendoza variant, the virus contains the
           sUMsDos id-string.  .EXE files may be infected multiple times.
       Spanish JB : Similar to Jerusalem, it reinfects .EXE files.
           The increased file size on .COM files is always 1,808
           bytes.  On .EXE files, the increased file size may be
           either 1,808 or 1,813, with reinfections always adding
           1,808 bytes to the already infected file.  No "Black
           Box" appears.  The characteristic sUMsDos id-string does
           not appear in the viral code.  This variant is also sometimes
           identified as Jerusalem E2.  Origin: Spain

 Virus Name:  JoJo
 Aliases:
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  May, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM growth, system hangs
 Origin:      Israel
 Eff Length:  1,701 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRaC - Parasitic Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V63+, Pro-Scan 1.4+, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The JoJo virus was discovered in Israel in May, 1990.  The virus'
       name comes from a message within the viral code:

          "Welcome to the JOJO Virus."

       One other message appears within the virus, indicating that it was
       written in 1990.  This message is: "Fuck the system (c) - 1990".
       Both messages within the viral code are never displayed.

       When the first file infected with the JoJo Virus is executed on a
       system, the virus will install itself memory resident.  The
       method used is to alter the Command Interpreter in memory,
       expanding its size.  As an example, on my test system, the
       Command Interpreter in memory increased in size from 3,536 bytes
       to 5,504 bytes.  One block of 48 bytes is also reserved in
       available free memory.  The change in free memory will
       be a net decrease of 2,048 bytes.

       The JoJo Virus will not infect files if interrupt 13 is in use
       by any other program.  Instead the virus will clear the screen,
       and the system will be hung.  If the user performs a warm reboot
       (Ctrl-Alt-Del), the virus will remain in memory.

       Once the virus is able to become memory resident with interrupt 13
       hooked, any .COM file executed will be infected by the virus.
       Infected files will increase in length by 1,701 bytes.

       While this virus has the same length as the Cascade/1701 Virus, it
       is not a variant of Cascade.


 Virus Name:  Joker
 Aliases:     Jocker
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  December, 1989
 Symptoms:    Messages, .EXE/.DBF growth
 Origin:      Poland
 Eff Length:  ??? Bytes
 Type Code:   PNE - Parasitic Non-Resident .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V57+, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Joker Virus was isolated in Poland in December, 1989.
       This virus is a generic .EXE file infector, and is a poor
       replicator (ie. it does not quickly infect other files).

       Programs which are infected with the Joker virus will
       display bogus error messages and comments.  These messages
       and comments can be found in the infected files at the
       beginning of the viral code.  Here are some of the
       messages and comments that may be displayed:

       "Incorrect DOS version"
       "Invalid Volume ID Format failure"
       "Please put a new disk into drive A:"
       "End of input file"
       "END OF WORKTIME.  TURN SYSTEM OFF!"
       "Divide Overflow"
       "Water detect in Co-processor"
       "I am hungry! Insert HAMBURGER into drive A:"
       "NO SMOKING, PLEASE!"
       " Thanks."
       "Don't beat me !!"
       "Don't drink and drive."
       "Another cup of cofee ?"
       " OH, YES!"
       "Hard Disk head has been destroyed. Can you borow me your one?"
       "Missing light magenta ribbon in printer!"
       "In case mistake, call GHOST BUSTERS"
       "Insert tractor toilet paper into printer."

       This virus may also alter .DBF files, adding messages to
       them.

       The sample in the author of this listing possession does not
       replicate on an 8088 based system.  This entry has been included
       since the sample may have been damaged before its receipt by
       the author.  At best, there is a serious bug in the replication
       portion of this virus which prevents it from replicating.


 Virus Name:  Joshi
 Aliases:     Happy Birthday Joshi, Stealth Virus
 V Status:    Common
 Discovered:  June, 1990
 Symptoms:    BSC, machine hangs and message
 Origin:      India
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   BRX - Resident Boot Sector/Partition Table Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V64+, Pro-Scan 1.4+
 Removal Instructions:  CleanUp V66+, Pro-Scan 1.4+, RmJoshi,
              or Low-Level Format Harddisk and DOS SYS floppies
 General Comments:
       The Joshi Virus was isolated in India in June 1990.  At the time it was
       isolated, it was reported to be widespread in India as well as
       portions of the continent of Africa.  Joshi is a memory resident
       boot sector infector of 5.25" diskettes.  It will also infect
       hard disks, though in the case of hard disks it infects the partition
       table or master boot sector rather than the boot sector (sector 0).

       After a system has been booted from a Joshi-infected diskette, the
       virus will be resident in memory.  Joshi takes up approximately
       6K of system memory, and infected systems will show that total
       system memory is 6K less than is installed if the DOS CHKDSK program
       is run.

       Joshi has some similarities to two other boot sector infectors.
       Like the Stoned virus, it infects the partition table of hard disks.
       Similar to the Brain virus's method of redirecting all attempts to
       read the boot sector to the original bootsector, Joshi does this with
       the partition table.

       On January 5th of any year, the Joshi virus activates.  At that
       time, the virus will hang the system while displaying the message:

             "type Happy Birthday Joshi"

       If the system user then types "Happy Birthday Joshi", the system
       will again be usable.

       This virus may be recognized on infected systems by powering off
       the system and then booting from a known-clean write-protected
       DOS diskette.  Using a sector editor or viewer to look at the
       boot sector of suspect diskettes, if the first two bytes of the
       boot sector are hex EB 1F, then the disk is infected.  The EB 1F
       is a jump instruction to the rest of the viral  code. The remainder
       of the virus is stored on track 41, sectors 1 thru 5 on 360K
       5.25 inch Diskettes.  For 1.2M 5.25 inch diskettes, the viral code
       is located at track 81, sectors 1 thru 5.

       To determine if a system's hard disk is infected, you must look at
       the hard disk's partition table.  If the first two bytes of the
       partition table are EB 1F hex, then the hard disk is infected.  The
       remainder of the virus can be found at track 0, sectors 2 thru 6.
       The original partition table will be a track 0, sector 9.

       The Joshi virus can be removed from an infected system by first
       powering off the system, and then booting from a known-clean, write-
       protected master DOS diskette.  If the system has a hard disk, the
       hard disk should have data and program files backed up, and the the
       disk must be low-level formatted.  As of July 15, 1990, there are
       no known utilities which can disinfect the partition table of the
       hard disk when it is infected with Joshi.  Diskettes are easier to
       remove Joshi from, the DOS SYS command can be used, or a program
       such as MDisk from McAfee Associates, though this will leave the
       viral code in an unexecutable state on track 41.


 Virus Name:  July 13TH
 Aliases:
 V Status:    Endangered
 Discovered:  April, 1990
 Symptoms:    .EXE file growth, screen effects on July 13
 Origin:      Madrid, Spain
 Eff Length:  1,201 Bytes
 Type Code:   PNE - Parasitic Non-Resident .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V64+, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The July 13TH Virus was isolated in Madrid, Spain, in April 1990
       by Guillermo Gonzalez Garcia.  This virus is a generic .EXE file
       infector, and is not memory resident.

       When a program infected with the July 13TH Virus is executed, the
       virus will attempt to infect a .EXE file.  Files are only infected
       if they are greater in length than 1,201 bytes.  Infected files
       increase in size by 1,201 to 1,209 bytes.

       The July 13TH Virus activates on July 13th of any year.  At that
       time, a bouncing ball effect occurs on the system monitor's screen
       similar to the bouncing ball effect of the Ping Pong virus.  While
       this virus is disruptive, it does not cause any overt damage to
       files other than infecting them.  The bouncing ball effect is buggy
       in this virus, it will occasionally leave dots on the screen where
       it was passing if the screen has been scrolled for any reason.


 Virus Name:  June 16TH

 Origin:      Republic of South Africa
 Eff Length:  879 Bytes
 Type Code:   PNC - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V62+, Pro-Scan 1.4+, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The June 16TH, or Pretoria, virus was discovered in April 1990.
       This virus is a non-resident generic .COM file infector, and is
       encrypted.  The first time an infected file is executed, the virus
       will search the current drive (all directories) and infect all
       .COM files found.  The search period can be quite long, and it is
       very obvious on hard disk based systems that the program is taking
       too long to load.

       On June 16TH of any year, the first time an infected file is
       executed the virus will activate.  On activation, the virus will
       change all entries in the root directory and the file allocation
       table to "ZAPPED".

       The June 16TH virus is thought to have originated in South
       Africa.


 Virus Name:  Kennedy

 Origin:      Denmark
 Eff Length:  333 Bytes
 Type Code:   PNCKF - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V62+, Pro-Scan 1.4+, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Kennedy Virus was isolated in April 1990.  It is a generic
       infector of .COM files, including COMMAND.COM.

       This virus has three activation dates: June 6 (assasination of
       Robert Kennedy 1968), November 18 (death of Joseph Kennedy 1969),
       and November 22 (assasination of John F. Kennedy 1963) of any
       year. On activation, the virus will display a message the following
       message:

               "Kennedy is dead - long live 'The Dead Kennedys'"

       The following text strings can be found in the viral code:
               "\command.com"
               "The Dead Kennedys"

       Systems infected with the Kennedy Virus will experience
       crosslinking of files, lost clusters, and file allocation table
       errors (including messages that the file allocation table is
       bad).

 Symptoms:    BSC - 360k disks
 Origin:      Seoul, Korea
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   RF - Resident Floppy Boot Sector Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V61+
 Removal Instructions: M-Disk, or DOS SYS Command
 General Comments:
       The Korea, or LBC Boot, Virus was isolated in March 1990 in
       Seoul, Korea.  This virus is a memory resident boot sector
       infector for 5.25" 360K diskettes.

       The Korea virus is not intentionally destructive, it does nothing
       in its current form except for replicating.  In some instances,
       when Korea infects a diskette it will damage the root directory as
       it moves the original boot sector to sector 11, the last sector of
       the root directory.  If sector 11 previously contained directory
       entries, they will be lost.


 Virus Name:  Lehigh
 Aliases:
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  November, 1987
 Symptoms:    Corrupts boot sector & FAT
 Origin:      Pennsylvania, USA
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   ORaKT - Overwriting Resident COMMAND.COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: MDisk & replace COMMAND.COM with clean copy, or
       F-Prot
 General Comments:
       The Lehigh virus infects only the COMMAND.COM file on both
       floppies and hard drives.  The infection mechanism is to over-
       write the stack space.  When a disk which contains an
       uninfected copy of COMMAND.COM is accessed, that disk is then
       infected.  A infection count is kept in each copy of the virus,
       and after 4 infections, the virus overwrites the boot sector and
       FATs.

       A variation of the Lehigh virus, Lehigh-2, exists which
       maintains its infection counter in RAM and corrupts the boot
       sector and FATs after 10 infections.

       Known variants of the Lehigh virus are:
       Lehigh-2 : Similar to Lehigh, but the infection counter is maintained
                  in RAM, and the corruption of the boot sector and FATs
                  occurs after 10 infections.
       Lehigh-B : Similar to Lehigh, the virus has been modified to
                  avoid detection.


 Virus Name:  Leprosy
 Aliases:     Leprosy 1.00
 V Status:    New
 Discovered:  August, 1990
 Symptoms:    unusual messages; program corruption
 Origin:      California, USA
 Eff Length:  666 Bytes
 Type Code:   ONAK - Overwriting Non-Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Leprosy Virus was discovered in the San Francisco Bay Area of
       California on August 1, 1990.  This virus is a non-resident
       overwriting virus infecting .COM and .EXE files, including
       COMMAND.COM.  Its original carrier file is suspected to be a file
       called 486COMP.ZIP which was uploaded to several BBSes.

       When you execute a program infected with the Leprosy virus, the virus
       will overwrite the first 666 bytes of all .COM and .EXE files in
       the current directory.  If COMMAND.COM is located in the current
       director, it will also be overwritten.  Infected files will show
       no file length increase unless they were originally less than 666
       bytes in length, in which case their length will become 666 bytes.

       After the virus has infected the .COM and .EXE files, it will display
       a message.  The message will be either:

               "Program to big to fit in memory"

       or:

               "NEWS FLASH!!  Your system has been infected with the
                incurable decay of LEPROSY 1.00, a virus invented by
                PCM2 in June of 1990.  Good luck!"

       The second message will only be displayed by one out of every seven
       .COM and .EXE files that the program infects.

       Since Leprosy is an overwriting virus, the programs which are
       infected with it will not function properly.  In fact, once they are
       infected with this virus they will run for awhile (while the virus is
       infecting other files) and then display one of the two messages.  The
       program execution will then end.

       If the system is booted from a diskette or hard drive that has Leprosy
       in its COMMAND.COM file, one of the above two messages will be
       displayed followed by:

               "Bad or missing Command Interpreter"

       This boot problem occurs because COMMAND.COM is no longer really
       COMMAND.COM.  The boot will not proceed until a system boot diskette
       is inserted into the system and another boot is attempted.

       While Leprosy's messages are encrypted in the virus, infected files
       can be found by checking for the following hex string near the
       beginning of the file:

               740AE8510046FE06F002EB08

       Infected files must be deleted and replaced with clean, uninfected
       copies.  There is no way to disinfect this virus since the first 666
       bytes of the file have been overwritten, the virus does not store
       those bytes anywhere else.


 Virus Name:  Liberty

 Type Code:   PRfAK - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V63+, Pro-Scan 1.4+, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Liberty Virus was isolated in Sydney, Australia in May, 1990.
       Liberty is a memory resident generic file infector, infecting
       .COM, .EXE, and overlay files.  COMMAND.COM may also become
       infected.

       The Liberty Virus gets its name from the text string "Liberty"
       which will appear in all infected files in the last 3K of the
       file.

       The first time a file infected with the Liberty Virus is executed,
       the virus will become memory resident.  Liberty installs itself
       resident in high free memory, resulting in a decrease of 8K of
       available free memory.  It also directly changes the interrupt
       map page in memory so that interrupt 21 will put the virus in
       control.  Total system memory does not change.

       After becoming memory resident, programs which are executed may
       be infected by the virus.  All .EXE files will be infected, but
       only .COM files over 2K in length will become infected.  Overlay
       files will also become infected.  Infected files will increase
       in size between 2,862 and 2,887 bytes.

       Liberty is a self-encrypting virus.  It is not yet known if it
       is destructive.


 Virus Name:  Lisbon

 Type Code:   PNC - Parasitic Non-Resident COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V49+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, Pro-Scan 1.4+, VirexPC, or F-Prot
 General Comments:
       The Lisbon virus is a strain of the Vienna virus first
       isolated by Jean Luz in Portugal in November, 1989.  The virus
       is very similar to Vienna, except that almost every word in
       the virus has been shifted 1-2 bytes in order to avoid virus
       identification/detection programs which could identify the
       Vienna virus.

       1 out of every 8 infected files will have the 1st 5 bytes of
       the 1st sector changed to "@AIDS", thus rendering the
       program unusable.

 Virus Name:  Mardi Bros
 Aliases:
 V Status:    New
 Discovered:  July, 1990
 Symptoms:    BSC; volume label change; decrease in system and free memory
 Origin:      France
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   FR - Floppy Boot Sector Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions: M-Disk, or DOS SYS Command
 General Comments:
       The Mardi Bros Virus was isolated in July 1990 in France.  This virus
       is a memory resident infector of floppy disk boot sectors.  It does
       not infect hard disk boot sectors or partition tables.

       When a system is booted from a diskette infected with the Mardi Bros
       Virus, the virus will install itself memory resident.  It resides in
       7,168 bytes above the top of memory, but below the 640K DOS Boundary.
       The decrease in system and free memory can be seen using the DOS
       CHKDSK command, or several other memory mapping utilities.

       Mardi Bros will infect any non-write protected diskette which is
       exposed to the system.  Infected diskettes can be easily identified
       as their volume label will be changed to "Mardi Bros".  The CHKDSK
       program will show the following for the diskette's Volume label
       information:

            "Volume Mardi Bros created ira 0, 1980 12:00a"

       While the infected boot sector on the diskette will have the DOS
       messages still remaining, it will also include the following phrase
       near the end:

            "Sudah ada vaksin"

       It is unknown if Mardi Bros is destructive, it appears to do nothing
       but spread.

       Mardi Bros can be removed from infected diskettes by first powering
       off the system and rebooting from a known clean write protected
       DOS master diskette.  The DOS SYS command should then be used to
       replace the infected diskette's boot sector.  Alternately, MDisk
       can be used following the power-down and reboot.


 Virus Name:  Microbes
 Aliases:
 V Status:    Common - India
 Discovered:  June, 1990
 Symptoms:    BSR
 Origin:      Bombay, India
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   BR - Floppy and Hard Disk Boot Sector Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V64+, Pro-Scan 1.4+
 Removal Instructions: M-Disk, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or DOS SYS Command
 General Comments:
       The Microbes virus was isolated in June, 1990 in India.  It is a
       memory resident boot sector infector of both floppy diskettes and
       hard disks.

       The Microbes virus becomes memory resident when a system is booted
       from a disk infected with the Microbes virus.  The system may hang
       on this boot, and inserted a diskette to boot from will result in
       this new diskette becoming infected.  At least on the author's XT
       test system, the system could not successfully boot with the
       Microbes virus present without powering off the system and rebooting
       from a write protected master boot diskette.

       As with other boot sector infectors, Microbes can be disinfected
       from diskettes and hard drives by powering off the system and
       booting from a known clean write protected master boot diskette
       for the system.  The DOS SYS command can then be used to recreate
       the boot sector on the diskette.


 Virus Name:  MIX/1
 Aliases:     MIX1
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  August, 1989
 Symptoms:    TSR, .EXE growth, location 0:33C = 77h, garbled output
 Origin:      Israel
 Eff Length:  1,618 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRsE - Parasitic Resident .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V37+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, Virus Buster, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or F-Prot
 General Comments:
       The MIX1 Virus was originally isolated on August 22, 1989, on
       several BBSs in Israel.  This virus is a parasitic memory-
       resident .EXE file infector.  Once an infected program has been
       executed, the virus will take up 2,048 bytes in RAM.  Each
       .EXE file then executed will grow in length between 1,618 and
       1,634 bytes, depending on the original file size.  The virus
       will not, however, infect files of less than 8K in size.

       Infected files can be manually identified by a characteristic
       "MIX1" always being the last 4 bytes of an infected file.
       Using Debug, if byte 0:33C equals 77h, then the MIX1 virus is
       in memory.

       This virus will cause garbled output on both serial and
       parallel devices, as well as the the num-lock being constantly
       on.  After the 6th infection, booting the system will crash
       the system due to a bug in the code, and a ball will start
       bouncing on the system monitor.

       There is a variant of this virus which does not have the
       problem of system crashes occurring, and will only infect files
       that are greater than 16K in length.

       Mix/1 has several code similarilities to Icelandic, which it may
       have been derived from.

 Virus Name:  Murphy
 Aliases:     Murphy-1, V1277, Stealth Virus
 V Status:    Common - Bulgaria
 Discovered:  April, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM & .EXE growth, system hangs, speaker noise,
              system drops into ROM Basic on the hour (see Murphy-2 below)
 Origin:      Sofia, Bulgaria
 Eff Length:  1,277 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRA - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V63+, Pro-Scan 1.4+
 Removal Instructions:  Scan/D, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Murphy Virus was isolated in Bulgaria in April, 1990.  It is
       a memory resident generic .COM & .EXE infector, and will infect
       COMMAND.COM.

       The first time an infected program is executed on a system, the
       virus installs itself memory resident.  After it is memory resident,
       if a file is executed, or openned for any reason, it is infected by
       the Murphy Virus.  When the first non-infected program is executed
       with the virus in memory, the virus will attempt to infect
       COMMAND.COM.  The program being executed will also be infected at
       that time.  Infected programs will increase in length by
       1,277 Bytes.  Programs which are less than 1,277 Bytes in length
       will not be infected.

       The Murphy Virus watchs the system time.  When the system time is
       between 10AM and 11AM, the virus will turn on the system speaker
       and send a 61h to it.  At any other time, the virus will not
       attempt to use the system speaker.

       The following text message is contained within the Murphy Virus,
       giving an idea of when it was written and by whom, though they are
       not displayed:

            "Hello, I'm Murphy.  Nice to meet you friend.
             I'm written since Nov/Dec.
             Copywrite (c)1989 by Lubo & Ian, Sofia, USM Laboratory."

       Systems infected by the Murphy Virus may also experience system
       hangs when the virus attempts to infect .EXE files.

       Known variant(s) of the Murphy Virus are:
       Murphy-2 or V1521 - Similar to the Murphy Virus, its length is 1,521
              Bytes.  The non-displayed messages in the virus are now:

             "It's me - Murphy.
              Copywrite (c)1990 by Lubo & Ian, Sofia, USM Laboratory."

              The Murphy-2 will infect any .EXE file, as well as any .COM
              file over 900 Bytes.  Instead of turning the system speaker
              on between 10AM and 11AM, this variant waits for the system
              time to have the minutes set to 00, then it will use int 18
              to put the user into ROM Basic.

 Origin:      Holland
 Eff Length:  1,813 Bytes (.COM) & 1,808 Bytes (.EXE)
 Type Code:   PRsA - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V45+, F-Prot, Pro-Scan 1.4+
 Removal Instructions:  Saturday, CleanUp, F-Prot, Pro-Scan 1.4+
 General Comments:
       New Jerusalem is a variation of the original Jerusalem virus
       which has been modified to be undetectable by ViruScan versions
       prior to V45 as well as IBM's VIRSCAN product as of October 20,
       1989.  The virus was first detected when it was uploaded to
       several BBSs in Holland beginning on October 14, 1989.  It
       infects both .EXE and .COM files and activates on any Friday The
       13th, deleting infected programs when they are attempted to be
       run.

       This virus is memory resident, and as with other Jerusalem
       viruses, may infect overlay, .SYS, .BIN, and .PIF files.

 General Comments:
       The Ohio virus is a memory resident boot sector infector, only
       infecting 360K floppy disks.  The Ohio virus is similar in
       many respects to the Den Zuk virus, and is believed to possibly
       be the earlier version of Den Zuk.  A diskette infected with
       Ohio will be immune to infection by the Pakistani Brain virus.

       The following text strings appear in the Ohio virus:

 Virus Name:  Ontario
 Aliases:
 V Status:    New
 Discovered:  July, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM & .EXE growth; decrease in system and free memory;
              hard disk errors in the case of extreme infections
 Origin:      Ontario, Canada
 Eff Length:  512 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRtAK - Parasitic Encrypted Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions:  SCAN /D, or Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Ontario Virus was isolated by Mike Shields in Ontario, Canada
       in July, 1990.  The Ontario virus is a memory resident infector of
       .COM, .EXE, and overlay files.  It will infect COMMAND.COM.

       The first time a program infected with the Ontario Virus is executed,
       it will install itself memory resident above the top of system memory
       but below the 640K DOS boundary.  Total system memory and free memory
       will be decreased by 2,048 bytes.  At this time, the virus will
       infect COMMAND.COM on the C: drive, increasing its length by 512 bytes.

       Each time an uninfected program is executed on the system with the
       virus memory resident, the program will become infected with the viral
       code located at the end of the file.  For .COM files, they will
       increase by 512 bytes in all cases.  For .EXE and overlay files, the
       file length increase will be 512 - 1023 bytes.  The difference in
       length for .EXE and overlay files is because the virus will fill out
       the unused space at the end of the last sector of the uninfected file
       with random data (usually a portion of the directory) and then append
       itself to the end of the file at the next sector.  Systems using
       a sector size of more than 512 bytes may notice larger file increases
       for infected files.  Infected files will always have a file length
       that is a multiple of the sector size on the disk.

       In the case of extreme infections of the Ontario Virus, hard disk
       errors may be noticed.

       Ontario uses a complex encryption routine, and a simple identification
       string will not identify this virus.


 Virus Name:  Oropax
 Aliases:     Music Virus, Musician

 Discovered:  December, 1989
 Symptoms:    .COM growth, tunes
 Origin:
 Eff Length:  2,756 - 2,806 bytes, but usually 2,773 bytes
 Type Code:   PRC - Parasitic Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V53+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions:  SCAN /D, F-Prot, VirexPC, Pro-Scan 1.4+,
              or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Oropax virus has had several reports, but wasn't first isolated
       until December 1989.  It infects .COM files, increasing their length
       by between 2,756 bytes and 2,806 bytes.  Infected files will always
       have a length divisible by 51.  The virus may become active (on a
       random basis) five minutes after infection of a file, playing three
       different tunes with a seven minute interval in between.

       One variant recently reported in Europe plays six different
       tunes at seven minute intervals.

 General Comments:
       The Payday virus was isolated by Jan Terpstra of the Netherlands
       in November, 1989.  It is a variant of the Jerusalem B virus,
       the major difference being that the activation criteria to
       delete files has been changed from every Friday The 13th to
       any Friday but Friday The 13ths.

 Virus Name:  Pentagon
 Aliases:
 V Status:    Extinct
 Discovered:  January, 1988
 Symptoms:    TSR, BSC 360k floppys, file (see text)
 Origin:      USA
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   RF - Resident Floppy Boot Sector Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, F-Prot, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: MDisk, CleanUp, or DOS SYS Command
 General Comments:
       The Pentagon virus consists of a normal MS-DOS 3.20 boot
       sector where the name 'IBM' has been replaced by 'HAL', along
       with two files.  The first file has a name of the hex
       character 0F9H, and contains the portion of the virus code
       which would not fit into the boot sector, as well as the
       original boot sector of the infected disk.  The second file
       is named PENTAGON.TXT and does not appear to be used or contain
       any data.  The 0F9H file is accessed by its absolute storage
       address.  Portions of this virus are encrypted.

       The Pentagon virus only infects 360K floppies, and will look
       for and remove the Brain virus from any disk that it infects.
       It is memory resident, occupying 5K of RAM, and can survive
       a warm reboot or CTL-ALT-DEL.

 Origin:      Germany
 Eff Length:  765 Bytes
 Type Code:   PNCK - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method: ViruScan V57+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: F-Prot, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Perfume virus is of German origin, and has also been
       isolated in Poland in December, 1989.  This virus infects
       .COM files, and will look for COMMAND.COM and infect it if
       it isn't already infected.  Infected files always grow in
       length by 765 bytes.

       The virus will sometimes ask the system user a question,
       and then not run the infected program unless the system
       user responds by typing 4711, the name of a German perfume.

       In the most common variant of this virus, however, the
       questions have been overwritten with miscellaneous
       characters.

 Virus Name:  Phoenix

 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  July, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM growth, system reboots, CHKDSK program failure,
              COMMAND.COM header change
 Origin:      Bulgaria
 Eff Length:  1,704 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRhCK - Parasitic Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method: ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Phoenix virus is of Bulgarian origin, and was submitted to
       the author of this document in July, 1990 by Vesselin Bontchev.
       This virus is one of a family of three (3) viruses which may be
       referred to as the P1 or Phoenix Family.  Each of these viruses is
       being documented separately due to their varying characteristics.
       The Phoenix virus is a memory resident, generic infector of .COM
       files, and will infect COMMAND.COM.

       The first time a program infected with the Phoenix virus is executed,
       the virus will install itself memory resident in free high memory,
       reserving 8,192 bytes.  Interrupt 2A will be hooked by the virus.
       System total memory and free memory will decrease by 8,192 bytes.
       If the program was executed from a floppy drive, and COMMAND.COM was
       not present on the diskette, the virus will request that a diskette
       with \COMMAND.COM present be inserted in the drive.  Phoenix will
       immediately infect COMMAND.COM by overwriting part of the binary zero
       portion of the program, and changing the program's header information.
       COMMAND.COM will not change in file length.  The virus will then
       similarly infect COMMAND.COM residing in the C: drive root directory.

       After becoming memory resident, the virus will attempt to infect any
       .COM file executed.  Most of its attempts, however, will not result in
       a file being infected.  Phoenix is a fairly poor replicator.  If the
       virus is successful in infecting the file, it will append its viral
       code to the end of the file, increasing the file's length by 1,704
       bytes.

       Phoenix is not able to recognize when it has previously infected a file,
       so it may reinfect .COM files several times.  Each infection will
       result in another 1,704 bytes of viral code being appended to the
       file.

       Systems infected with the Phoenix virus will experience problems with
       executing CHKDSK.COM.  Attempts to execute this program with Phoenix
       memory resident will result in a warm reboot of the system occurring,
       however the memory resident version of Phoenix will not survive the
       reboot.  If an autoexec.bat file is not present on the drive being
       booted from, the system will prompt for the user to enter Date and
       Time.

       The Phoenix Virus employs a complex encryption mechanism, and virus
       scanners which are only able to look for simple hex strings will not
       be able to detect it.  There is no simple hex string in this virus
       that is common to all infected samples.

       This virus is not related to the Cascade (1701/1704) Virus.

 Origin:      Bulgaria
 Eff Length:  1,704 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRhCK - Parasitic Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method: ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The PhoenixD virus is of Bulgarian origin, and was submitted to
       the author of this document in July, 1990 by Vesselin Bontchev.
       This virus is one of a family of three (3) viruses which may be
       referred to as the P1 or Phoenix Family.  Each of these viruses is
       being documented separately due to their varying characteristics.
       The PhoenixD virus is a memory resident, generic infector of .COM
       files, and will infect COMMAND.COM.

       The PhoenixD Virus is a "bug fixed" version of the Phoenix virus.

       The first time a program infected with the PhoenixD virus is executed,
       the virus will install itself memory resident in free high memory,
       reserving 8,192 bytes.  Interrupt 2A will be hooked by the virus.
       System total memory and free memory will decrease by 8,192 bytes.
       PhoenixD will then check to see if the current drive's root directory
       contains a copy of COMMAND.COM.  If a copy of COMMAND.COM is found,
       it will be infected by PhoenixD by overwriting part of the binary zero
       portion of the program, and changing the program's header information.
       COMMAND.COM will not change in file length.  The virus will then
       similarly infect COMMAND.COM residing in the C: drive root directory.

       After becoming memory resident, the virus will attempt to infect any
       .COM file executed.  PhoenixD is a much better replicator than the
       original Phoenix Virus, and is usually able to infect files.  Infected
       files will increase in length by 1,704 bytes.

       PhoenixD is not able to recognize when it has previously infected a
       file, so it may reinfect .COM files several times.  Each infection will
       result in another 1,704 bytes of viral code being appended to the
       file.

       A characteristic present in the PhoenixD Virus which is not found in
       the original Phoenix Virus is that in addition to it infecting .COM
       files as they are executed, .COM files will be infected when they
       are openned for any reason.  The simple act of copying a .COM file
       with PhoenixD present in memory will result in both the source and
       target files being infected.

       Systems infected with the PhoenixD virus will experience problems with
       executing CHKDSK.COM.  Attempts to execute this program with Phoenix
       memory resident will result in a warm reboot of the system occurring.
       If an autoexec.bat file is not present on the drive being booted from,
       the system will prompt for the user to enter Date and Time.

       The PhoenixD Virus employs a complex encryption mechanism, and virus
       scanners which are only able to look for simple hex strings will not
       be able to detect it.  There is no simple hex string in this virus
       that is common to all infected samples.

 General Comments:
       The Ping Pong virus is a boot sector virus which was first
       reported in March 1988.  The original Ping Pong virus only
       infects Floppy Disks.

       When the virus activates, which is on a random basis, a
       bouncing ball or dot appears on the screen.  This display
       can only be stopped thru a system reboot.  No other damage
       is apparently done.

       The Ping Pong Virus is extinct, though the hard disk variant,
       Ping Pong-B listed below, is one of the most common MS-DOS
       viruses.


 Virus Name:  Ping Pong-B
 Aliases:     Bouncing Ball Boot
 V Status:    Common
 Discovered:  May, 1988
 Symptoms:    Graphic display (see text), TSR, BSC
 Origin:
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   BRs - Resident Boot Sector Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: CleanUp, MDisk, Pro-Scan 1.4+, F-Prot, VirexPC
              or DOS SYS Command
 General Comments:
       The Ping Pong-B virus is a variant of the Ping Pong virus.  The
       major difference is that Ping Pong-B can infect hard disks as
       well as floppies.

       Known variants of Ping Pong-B include:
       Ping Pong-C : Similar to Ping Pong-B, though this variant does
            not have the bouncing ball screen effect.
            Origin: Argentina, June 1990.


 Virus Name:  Plastique
 Aliases:     Plastic Bomb, Plastique 3012
 V Status:    New
 Discovered:  July, 1990
 Symptoms:    TSR, .COM & .EXE growth
 Origin:      Taiwan
 Eff Length:  3,012 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRsA - Parasitic Resident Boot Sector Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Plastique, or Plastic Bomb, Virus was submitted in July 1990, it
       comes to us from Taiwan.  Plastique is a memory resident generic
       infector of .COM and .EXE files, though it does not infect
       COMMAND.COM.

       The first time a program infected with Plastique is executed, the
       virus will install itself memory resident as a TSR in low system
       memory.  The TSR is 3,264 bytes in length, and hooks interrupt 21.

       After the virus is memory resident, it will attempt to infect any
       .COM or .EXE file which is executed.  This virus is rather "buggy",
       and it is not always successful in infecting files when they are
       executed.  When it is successful infecting the file, the file's
       length will increase.  For infected .COM files, the length will
       increase by 3,012 bytes.  For infected .EXE files, their length
       will increase between 3,012 and 3,020 bytes.

       Plastique will also attempt to infect files when they are openned for
       any reason, though again, it is not always successful.

       Known variant(s) of Plastique are:
       HM2            : The earliest known version of this virus, it does
                        not replicate.  Executing an "infected file results
                        in the system hanging requiring a reboot.
                        Origin: Taiwan, May 1990.
       Plastique 4.51 : A variant of the Plastique virus described above,
                        the only real difference is that the encryption
                        of the virus is slightly different.  Otherwise it
                        behaves exactly the same as Plastique.
                        Origin: Taiwan, July 1990.

 Virus Name:  Plastique-B
 Aliases:     Plastic Bomb, Plastique 5.21
 V Status:    New
 Discovered:  July, 1990
 Symptoms:    TSR, .COM & .EXE file growth
 Origin:      Taiwan
 Eff Length:  4,096 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRsA - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or Delete Infected Files
 General Comments:
       The Plastique-B, or Plastique 5.21, virus is a later version of
       the Plastique virus.  Like Plastique, it is a memory resident
       generic infector of .COM and .EXE files.  It does not infect
       COMMAND.COM.

       The first time a program infected with Plastique-B is executed, the
       virus will install itself memory resident as a TSR in low system
       memory.  The TSR is 5,120 bytes in length.  Interrupts 08, 09, 13,
       21, and ED are hooked by the virus.

       After the virus is memory resident, it will attempt to infect any
       .COM or .EXE file which is executed or openned for any reason.  It
       has had many of the "bugs" fixed that were in Plastique, and is
       usually successful in infecting files.  Infected .COM and .EXE files
       will increase in length by 4,096 bytes.

       It is not known what damage this virus may do, or if it carries an
       activation date.

 Virus Name:  Print Screen
 Aliases:     EB 21, 8290, PRTSC Virus
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  November, 1989
 Symptoms:    BSC, hard disk access slowdown
 Origin:      Bombay, India
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   BR - Resident Boot Sector Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V64+, Pro-Scan 1.4+, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: M-Disk, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or DOS SYS Command
 General Comments:
       The Print Screen Virus was isolated in Bombay, India in November, 1989
       by Neville Bulsara.  It is the first virus to have originated in
       India.  There are two versions of Print Screen, the later version
       having had some bugs fixed.

       When a system is booted from a Print Screen infected diskette or
       hard drive, the virus will install itself memory resident in the
       top of memory.  The virus then adjusts the amount of memory DOS
       thinks is installed.  Infected systems will show that total system
       memory is 2K less than is installed.  On floppy disks, the original
       boot sector of the diskette will be copied to sector 11.

       After becoming memory resident, the virus will infect any hard
       disk or floppy diskette which is accessed by the system.

       Infected system users will notice that hard disk accesses done for
       any reason will be much slower than expected.  In some cases,
       listing the root directory will show apparently garbage entries in
       it.  These entries are actually part of the virus's code.

       The first version of the Print Screen virus is buggy, and as such
       it doesn't actually accomplish anything having to do with printing
       screens.

       This virus appears to have been based on the Ping Pong Virus, and
       some anti-viral programs will identify it as such.

       Known variant(s) of Print Screen are:
       Print Screen-2: Print Screen-2 is the later, bug fixed version of
            the Print Screen Virus.  This version will attempt to perform
            a screen print or dump to the system's printer after every
            255 disk I/Os have occurred.


 Virus Name:  RPVS
 Aliases:     453
 V Status:    New
 Discovery:   August, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM growth
 Origin:      West Germany
 Eff Length:  453 Bytes
 Type Code:   PNC - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V??+
 Removal Instructions: Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The RPVS, or 453, Virus was discovered in West Germany in early
       August, 1990.  This virus is a non-resident infector of .COM files.
       The RPVS is named for an unusual string that appears in a file
       dump of the virus - "TUQ.RPVS" - this in not really a text string,
       but a series of PUSH instructions.

       The RPVS Virus is rather unsophisticated virus.  Whenever a .COM
       program infected with the RPVS or 453 virus is executed, the virus
       will look for an uninfected .COM file in the current directory.  The
       virus determines if the .COM file has been previously infected by
       checking to see if the last two bytes of the file are 9090h.  If the
       last two bytes are not 9090h, the file will be infected, appending
       453 bytes of viral code to the end of the file.  One .COM file is
       infected each time an infected program is executed.  COMMAND.COM
       will not normally be infected.

       This virus does not contain any logic to activate and cause damage
       in its current state.  It does contain many NOP instructions and odd
       jumps which leave plenty of space for later additions.

       Known variant(s) of RPVS are:
       RPVS-B : The RPVS virus after additional bytes have been added to the
                end of an infected program.  When this occurs, the virus
                will act differently.  It will not be able to determine that
                it has already infected a .COM file, so it will reinfect
                the first .COM file it finds in the current directory over
                and over again.


 Virus Name:  Saratoga
 Aliases:     642, One In Two
 V Status:    Extinct
 Discovery:   July, 1989
 Symptoms:    .EXE growth, Resident, bad sectors, FAT corruption
 Origin:      California, USA
 Eff Length:  642 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRsE - Resident Parasitic .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan 1.4+, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, F-Prot, VirexPC, Pro-Scan 1.4+,
              or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Saratoga Virus was first isolated in California in July 1989.
       This virus is very similar to the Icelandic and Icelandic-II
       viruses, so only the differences from the Icelandic viruses
       are indicated here.  Please refer back to the description of
       the Icelandic virus for the base information.

       The Saratoga virus's main difference from the Icelandic virus
       is that when it copies itself to memory, it modifies the memory
       block so that it appears to belong to the operating system,
       thus avoiding another program reusing the block.

       Similar to the Icelandic-II virus, the Saratoga can infect
       programs even if the system has installed an anti-viral TSR
       which "hooks" interrupt 21, such as FluShot+.  Also like
       Icelandic-II is that this virus can infect programs which have
       been marked Read-Only, though it does not restore the Read-Only
       attribute to the file afterwards.

 Virus Name:  Saturday The 14TH
 Aliases:     Durban
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  March, 1990
 Symptoms:    TSR;.COM, .EXE, .OV? growth; corrupts boot sector,
              FAT. & partition table on Saturday 14th
 Origin:      Republic of South Africa
 Eff Length:  685 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRA - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V61+, Pro-Scan 1.4+, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The first reports of the Saturday The 14TH virus came from
       South Africa in March 1990.  The Saturday The 14TH, or Durban
       Virus, is a memory resident generic file infector, infecting
       .COM, .EXE, and overlay files, but not COMMAND.COM.  Infected
       files will increase in length by between 669 and 684 bytes.

       The Saturday The 14TH virus activates on any Saturday that falls
       on the 14TH of any month, at which time it will overwrite the
       first 100 logical sectors of the C: drive, B: drive, and A:
       drive.  In effect, on drive C:, the virus destroys the hard
       disk boot sector, partition table, and file allocation table (FAT).


 Virus Name:  SF Virus
 Aliases:
 V Status:    Extinct
 Discovered:  December, 1987
 Symptoms:    BSC 360k floppys, Resident TOM, formatted disks
 Origin:      California, USA
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   RtF - Resident Floppy Boot Sector Infector
 Detection Method: ViruScan (identifies as Alameda)
 Removal Instructions: MDisk, CleanUp, F-Prot, or DOS SYS command
 General Comments:
       The SF Virus is a modified version of the Alameda virus
       which activates when the counter in the virus has determined
       that it is infected 100 diskettes.  The virus replicates when
       a CTL-ALT-DEL is performed, infecting the disk in the floppy
       drive.  Upon activation, the diskette in the floppy drive is
       reformatted.  The SF Virus only infects 5 1/4" 360K floppies.

 Virus Name:  Shake Virus
 Aliases:
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  May, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM growth, message, change in COMMAND.COM memory allocation
 Origin:      Bulgaria
 Eff Length:  476 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRCK - Resident Parasitic .COM Infector
 Detection Method: ViruScan V63+, Pro-Scan 1.4+, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or Delete Infected Files
 General Comments:
       The Shake Virus was first isolated in Bulgaria in May, 1990.  It is
       a memory resident generic .COM infector, and will infect COMMAND.COM.

       The first time an infected program is executed, the Shake Virus will
       install itself memory resident, altering the image of COMMAND.COM in
       memory.

       The Shake Virus infects .COM files, infecting them as they are
       accessed.  Infected files increase in size by 476 Bytes, though the
       size increase cannot be seen using a DIR (list directory) command
       if the virus is memory resident.

       While the virus is not destructive, it will occasionally
       display the message: "Shake well before use !" when an infected
       file is attempted to be run.  When this message is displayed, the
       program terminates rather than executes.  A second attempt to run
       the same program result in it running successfully.


 Virus Name:  Slow
 Aliases:
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  May, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM & .EXE growth
 Origin:      Australia
 Eff Length:  1,701 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRsA - Resident Parasitic .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method: ViruScan V63+, Pro-Scan 1.4+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or Delete Infected Files
 General Comments:
       The Slow Virus was discovered in Australia in May 1990.  It is
       a memory resident generic file infector, infected .COM, .EXE, and
       overlay files.  COMMAND.COM is not infected by this virus.

       The first time an infected file is executed on a system, the virus
       installs itself memory resident, taking up approximately 2K of
       free memory.  Then, as executable programs are openned for any
       reason, they are infected with the virus.  In the process of
       infecting some .EXE files, the virus may hang the system, causing
       the user to have to reboot.

       The Slow Virus is based on the Jerusalem B virus.

       It is unknown what else the Slow virus does.


 Virus Name:  Solano 2000
 Aliases:     Dyslexia 2.01
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  March, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM growth, TSR, unusual file errors
 Origin:      California, USA
 Eff Length:  2,000 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRsC - Resident Parasitic .COM Infector
 Detection Method: ViruScan V60+, Pro-Scan 1.4+, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or Delete Infected Files
 General Comments:
       The Solano 2000 Virus was first isolated in Solano County,
       California in mid-March 1990 by Edward Winters.  The virus may
       also be known by the name Dyslexia Virus V2.01, which can be
       produced by negating some null terminated bytes within the
       viral code.  Using the same technique, what appears to be the
       creation date of the virus, 08FEB90, can be produced.  The
       information regarding the information produced by negation of
       bytes was determined by Jay Parangalan of Solano County.

       The Solano 2000 Virus is a generic .COM file infector.  The first
       time an infected .COM file is executed on the system, the virus
       installs itself memory resident, then proceeds to infect every
       .COM file that is executed.  Infected programs can be manually
       identified by using a sector editor to view the file.  Bytes
       1168 thru 1952 will consist of '(' or 28h characters.

       Some programs, such as DiskCopy.COM which is included on all
       DOS diskettes, will not run after being infected with this virus,
       instead an "invalid drive specification" message will be
       displayed.  This message is not in the viral code, but is due
       to an error condition now existing in the DiskCopy program.  The
       virus-induced error in the DiskCopy program was how the virus was
       first spotted.

       This particular virus, in its current state, does not survive a
       system warm reboot (CTL-ALT-DEL).  When it is memory resident, it
       takes up 3K bytes of RAM.

       The Solano 2000 Virus does no apparent system damage, however it
       does check the video buffer occasionally, and may transpose
       numbers if they are found in certain locations.  This effect,
       however, was not experienced on the author's system in researching
       this virus.  There have also been reports that instead of transposing
       numeric characters, the Solano virus may change color attributes on
       the display screen when it is active in memory.

       Known variants of the Solano 2000 virus:
       Solano 2000-B: same as Solano 2000, except the 28h characters
             have been changed to DAh characters, and are located in
             bytes 1168 thru 1912 in infected files.
       Dyslexia 2.00: same as Solano 2000, except that the 28h characters
             are now binary zeros.  The attempted transposing of numeric
             characters in video memory has also been slowed down.  The
             creation date appears to be 22JAN90 instead of 08FEB90.

 Virus Name:  Sorry
 Aliases:     G-Virus V1.3
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  June, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM growth, decrease in system and free memory
 Origin:
 Eff Length:  731 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRNCK - Parasitic Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V64+, F-Prot
 Removal Instructions:  Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Sorry Virus was isolated in June, 1990.  Its name comes from
       a german phrase in the virus: "Tut mir Leid !".  This
       virus is based on the Perfume Virus from West Germany, and some
       anti-viral programs will identify it as Perfume or 4711.

       The first time a program infected with the Sorry Virus is executed,
       the virus will install itself memory resident in high memory.  Total
       system memory and free memory will both decrease by 1,024 bytes.
       Interrupt 21 will be hooked by the virus.  COMMAND.COM is immediately
       infected by the virus, thus insuring on later system boots that the
       virus becomes memory resident immediately.

       After the virus is memory resident, it will infect any .COM file
       which is executed, increaseing the file's length by 731 bytes.  The
       viral code is located at the end of infected files.

       The Sorry Virus contains the following text strings:

                "G-VIRUS V1.3"
                "Bitte gebe den G-Virus Code ein"
                "Tut mir Leid !"

       It is unknown what the Sorry Virus does when it activates.

 Virus Name:  Stoned
 Aliases:     Hawaii, Marijuana, New Zealand, San Diego, Smithsonian
 V Status:    Common
 Discovered:  February, 1988
 Symptoms:    BSC, TSR, messages, RLL controller hangs
 Origin:      New Zealand
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   BRX - Resident Boot Sector Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, CleanUp, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions:  CleanUp, MDisk, F-Prot, Pro-Scan 1.4+
 General Comments:
       The Stoned virus was first reported in Wellington, New
       Zealand in early 1988.  The original virus only infected
       360KB 5 1/4" diskettes, doing no overt damage.  There are,
       however, two known variants which can infect hard disks.

       This virus becomes memory resident following the system being
       booted from an infected disk.  It will infect any diskette
       inserted into the system and accessed.

       On one out of every eight system bootup, the virus will
       display the message:

             "Your computer is now stoned.  Legalize Marijuana"

       The Stoned virus can be removed from 360KB diskettes by
       using either the MDisk, CleanUp, or F-Prot programs.  It
       can also be removed from diskettes by using the DOS SYS
       command.

       Known variants of the Stoned Virus are:
       Stoned-B : same as Stoned, but can also infect hard disks via
                  the hard disk's partition table.  Infected
                  systems with RLL controllers will frequently hang.
       Stoned-C : same as Stoned, except that the message has been
                  removed.
       Stoned-D : same as Stoned, with the exception that this variant
                  can infect high density 3.5" and 5.25" diskettes.

       For variants Stoned-B and Stoned-C, removal instructions are
       the same for diskettes.  However, an infected hard disk must
       be disinfected by using MDisk with the /P parameter or
       CleanUp.  The reason for the different hard disk
       instructions is due to Stoned infecting the partition
       table on the hard disk.

 Type Code:   PRsC - Resident Parasitic .COM Infector
 Detection Method: ViruScan V64+, Pro-Scan 1.4+

 General Comments:
       The Subliminal 1.10 Virus was first isolated in Solano County,
       California in May 1990 by Jay Parangalan.  The name of the
       virus can be produced by negating (XORing with FF) some null
       terminated bytes in the viral code.  Using this technique, the
       creation date of the virus appears to be 02OCT89.  The
       Subliminal 1.10 Virus appears to be a very early version of the
       Solano 2000 Virus, and has only been reported at Solano
       Community College.

       The first time a program infected with the Subliminal 1.10 Virus
       is executed, the virus installs itself memory resident.  Any
       .COM files which are then executed are infected.  Infected
       programs will increase in length by 1,496 bytes.

       With the virus memory resident, the system monitor will appear to
       flicker.  What is occurring is that the virus is attempting to
       flash the message "LOVE, REMEMBER?" in the lower left portion of
       the display for a subliminal duration.  The actual amount of time
       the message displays on the screen varies between systems due to
       CPU speed.

 Virus Name:  Sunday
 Aliases:
 V Status:    Common
 Discovered:  November, 1989
 Symptoms:    TSR, executable file growth, messages, FAT corruption
 Origin:      Washington (state), USA
 Eff Length:  1,636 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRsAT - Parasitic Resident .COM, .EXE. & .OV? Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V49+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC 1.1+
 Removal Instructions: CleanUp, Scan/D, F-Prot, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or VirexPC
 General Comments:
       The Sunday virus was discovered by many users in the Seattle,
       Washington area in November, 1989.  This virus activates on
       any Sunday, displaying the message:

           "Today is Sunday! Why do you work so hard?
            All work and no play make you a dull boy!
            Come on! Let's go out and have some fun!"

       The Sunday virus appears to have been derived from the
       Jerusalem virus, the viral code being similar in many
       respects.

       Damage to the file allocation table or FAT has been reported
       from a number of infected users.

       Known variants of the Sunday Virus are:
       Sunday-B : Similar to the Sunday Virus, this variant does not activate
                  on any day of the week due to an error in the day of the
                  week checking routine.  The message in the virus is never
                  displayed, and no damage is done to the file allocation
                  table.
       Sunday-C : Similar to Sunday-B, this variant also never activates.  It
                  has, however, been modified so that it differs from both
                  the Sunday and Sunday-B viruses.  Functionally, it is the
                  same as Sunday-B.


 Virus Name:  Suriv 1.01
 Aliases:     April 1st, Israeli, Suriv01

 General Comments:
       The Suriv 2.01 virus is a memory resident .EXE infector.  It
       will activate on April 1st after memory is infected by running
       an infected file, displaying the same message as Suriv 1.01
       and locking up the system.  The virus will cause a similar
       lockup, though no message, 1 hour after an infected .EXE file
       is executed on any day on which the system default date of
       01-01-80 is used.  The virus will only infect the file once.


 Virus Name:  Suriv 3.00
 Aliases:     Israeli, Suriv03
 V Status:    Extinct
 Discovered:  1988
 Symptoms:    TSR, .COM, .EXE, & .SYS growth; Black Window; system slowdown
 Origin:      Israel
 Eff Length:  1,813 (COM files) & 1,808 (EXE files) bytes
 Type Code:   PRsA - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, F-Prot, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: CleanUp, Scan/D, F-Prot, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or Unvirus
 General Comments:
       May be a variant of the Jerusalem virus.  The string "sUMsDos"
       has been changed to "sURIV 3.00".  The Suriv 3.00 virus
       activates on Friday The 13ths when an infected program is
       run or if it is already present in system memory, however
       files are not deleted due to a bug in the viral code.

       Other than on Friday The 13ths, after the virus is memory
       resident for 30 seconds, an area of the screen is turned into
       a "black window" and a time wasting loop is executed with
       each timer interrupt.

       As with the Jerusalem B viruses, this virus can also infect
       overlay, .SYS, and other executable files besides .EXE and
       .COM files, though it does not infect COMMAND.COM itself.

 Virus Name:  Swap
 Aliases:     Falling Letters Boot, Israeli Boot
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  August, 1989
 Symptoms:    Graphic display, BSC (floppy only), TSR, bad cluster,
 Origin:      Israel
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   RsF - Resident Floppy Boot Sector Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, F-Prot, IBM Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions:  MDisk, CleanUp, F-Prot, or DOS SYS Command
 General Comments:
       The Swap Virus, or Israeli Boot Virus, was first reported in
       August 1989.  This virus is a memory resident boot sector
       infector that only infects floppies.  The floppy's boot
       sector is infected the first time it is accessed.  One bad
       cluster will be written on track 39, sectors 6 and 7 with the
       head unspecified.  If track 39, sectors 6 and 7, are not
       empty, the virus will not infect the disk.  Once the virus
       is memory resident, it uses 2K or RAM.  The actual length of
       the viral code is 740 bytes.

       The Swap virus activates after being memory resident for 10
       minutes.  A cascading effect of letters and characters on the
       system monitor is then seen, similar to the cascading effect
       of the Cascade and Traceback viruses.

       The virus was named the Swap virus because the first isolated
       case had the following phrase located at bytes 00B7-00E4 on
       track 39, sector 7:

           "The Swapping-Virus. (C) June, 1989 by the CIA"

       However, this phrase is not found on diskettes which have been
       freshly infected by the Swap virus.

       A diskette infected with the Swap virus can be easily identified
       by looking at the boot sector with a sector editor, such as
       Norton Utilities.  The error messages which normally occur at
       the end of the boot sector will not be there, instead the start
       of the virus code is present.  The remainder of the viral code
       is located on track 39, sectors 6 and 7.


 Virus Name:  SysLock
 Aliases:     3551, 3555
 V Status:    Endangered
 Discovered:  November, 1988
 Symptoms:    .COM & .EXE growth, data file corruption
 Origin:
 Eff Length:  3,551 Bytes
 Type Code:  PNA - Encrypting Non-Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, F-Prot, Pro-Scan
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or F-Prot
 General Comments:
       The SysLock virus is a parasitic encrypting virus which
       infects both .COM and .EXE files, as well as damaging some
       data files on infected systems.  This virus does not install
       itself memory resident, but instead searches through the
       .COM and .EXE files and subdirectories on the current disk,
       picking one at executable file at random to infect.  The
       infected file will have its length increased by approximately
       3,551 bytes, though it may vary slightly depending on file
       infected.

       The SysLock virus will damage files by searching for the word
       "Microsoft" in any combination of upper and lower case
       characters, and when found replace the word with "MACROSOFT".

       If the SysLock virus finds that an environment variable
       "SYSLOCK" exists in the system and has been set to "@" (hex 40),
       the virus will not infect any programs or perform string
       replacements, but will instead pass control to its host
       immediately.

       Known variant(s) of SysLock are:
       Macho-A : same as the SysLock virus, except that "Microsoft"
                 is replaced with "MACHOSOFT".


 Virus Name:  Taiwan
 Aliases:     Taiwan 2
 V Status:    Endangered
 Discovered:  January, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM growth, 8th day any month corrupts BOOT, FAT,
              & Partition tables.
 Origin:      Taiwan
 Eff Length:  743 Bytes
 Type Code:   PNCK - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V56+, F-Prot, Pro-Scan 1.4+, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Taiwan virus was first isolated in January, 1990 in
       Taiwan, R.O.C.  This virus infects .COM files, including
       COMMAND.COM, and does not install itself into system memory.

       Each time a program infected with the Taiwan virus is executed, the
       virus will attempt to infect up to 3 .COM files.  The current
       default directory is not first infected, instead the virus will
       start its search for candidate files in the C: drive root directory.
       Once an uninfected .COM file is located, the virus infects the file
       by copying the viral code to the first 743 bytes of the file, the
       original first 743 bytes of the file is relocated to the end of the
       .COM file.  A bug exists in this virus, if the uninfected .COM file
       is less than 743 bytes in length, the resulting infected .COM file
       will always be 1,486 bytes in length.  This effect is due to the
       virus not checking to see if it read less than 743 bytes of the
       original file before infecting it.

       The Taiwan virus is destructive.  On the 8th day of any month, when
       an infected program is run the virus will perform an absolute disk
       write for 160 sectors starting at logical sector 0 on the C: and
       D: drives.  In effect, this logical write will result in the FATs
       and root directory being overwritten.


 Virus Name:  Taiwan 3
 Aliases:
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  June, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM & .EXE growth, decrease in available free memory,
              system hangs
 Origin:      Taiwan
 Eff Length:  2,900 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRA - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V64+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Taiwan 3 Virus was isolated in June, 1990 in Taiwan, R.O.C.  It
       was dubbed the Taiwan 3 Virus by John McAfee because it is the third
       virus from Taiwan, the other two are Taiwan and Disk Killer.  This
       virus is not related to either of these two viruses.

       The first time a program infected with the Taiwan 3 Virus is executed
       on a system, the virus will install itself memory resident in low
       system free memory.  Available free memory will decrease by 3,152
       bytes.  The virus hooks interrupt 21.

       After becoming memory resident, Taiwan 3 will infect any program
       which is executed.  .COM files will increase in length by 2,900
       bytes, .EXE files will increase by between 2,900 and 2,908 bytes.
       Overlay files may also become infected as well.

       It is unknown what the activation criteria is for this virus, or
       what it does besides spreading.

 Virus Name:  TCC
 Aliases:
 V Status:    New
 Discovery:   August, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM & .EXE file growth; slow program loads upon execution
 Origin:      Paris, France
 Eff Length:  4,909 Bytes
 Type Code:   PNAK - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method: ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The TCC Virus was isolated in Paris, France, in early August, 1990.
       This virus is a generic infector of .COM, .EXE and overlay files,
       and will infect COMMAND.COM.  It is not memory resident.

       When a program infected with the TCC Virus is executed, the virus
       will infect all .COM, .EXE and overlay files on the current drive
       and directory, with the exception of very small .COM files.  It will
       also check to see if COMMAND.COM on the C: drive is uninfected, if it
       has not previously been infected it will become infected.  Infected
       files will increase in length by between 4,909 - 4, 25 bytes, with the
       virus located at the end of the infected file.

       It is unknown what this virus might do when and if it activates.


 Virus Name:  Tiny Family
 Aliases:     Tiny-158, Tiny-159, Tiny-160, Tiny-167, Tiny-198
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovery:   July, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM file growth
 Origin:      Bulgaria
 Eff Length:  158 - 198 Bytes (see below)
 Type Code:   PRC - Parasitic Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method: ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Tiny Family of Viruses was received by the author in July 1990
       from Vesselin Bontchev of Bulgaria.  All the viruses in this grouping
       share the same characteristics, with the only real difference is the
       effective length of the viral code.  There are five (5) viruses
       included in the "family" at the present time: Tiny-158, Tiny-159,
       Tiny-160, Tiny-167, and Tiny-198.

       The first time a file infected with one of the Tiny Family viruses
       is executed on a system, the virus will install itself memory resident
       in system free memory.  The memory used by the resident virus is not
       reserved, and may be overwritten later by another program.  Interrupt
       21 will be hooked by the virus.

       After the virus is memory resident, the virus will infect any .COM
       program that is executed.  Infected programs will have a file length
       increase of between 158 - 198 bytes, depending on which variant is
       present on the system.  The file's date and time in the directory will
       also have been updated to the system date and time when the infection
       occurred.

       The Tiny Family of Viruses currently does not do anything but
       replicate.

       The viruses in this "family" may or may not be related to the Tiny
       Virus documented below.

       Known members of the Tiny Family are:
       Tiny-158 : Same as above, effective length is 158 bytes.
       Tiny-159 : Same as above, effective length is 159 bytes.
       Tiny-160 : Same as above, effective length is 160 bytes.
       Tiny-167 : Same as above, effective length is 167 bytes.
       Tiny-198 : Same as above, effective length is 198 bytes.

 Virus Name:  Tiny Virus
 Aliases:     163 COM Virus, Tiny 163 Virus
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovery:   June, 1990
 Symptoms:    COMMAND.COM & .COM file growth
 Origin:      Iceland
 Eff Length:  163 Bytes
 Type Code:   PNCK - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V64+, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The 163 COM Virus, or Tiny Virus, was isolated by Fridrik Skulason
       of Iceland in June 1990.  This virus is a non-resident generic
       .COM file infector, and it will infect COMMAND.COM.

       The first time a file infected with the 163 COM Virus is executed,
       the virus will attempt to infect the first .COM file in the
       current directory.  On bootable diskettes, this file will normally
       be COMMAND.COM.  After the first .COM file is infected, each time
       an infected program is executed another .COM file will attempt to
       be infected.  Files are infected only if their original length is
       greater than approximately 1K bytes.

       Infected .COM files will increase in length by 163 bytes, and have
       date/time stamps in the directory changed to the date/time the
       infection occurred.  Infected files will also always end with this
       hex string: '2A2E434F4D00'.

       This virus currently does nothing but replicate, and is the
       smallest MS-DOS virus known as of its isolation date.

       The Tiny Virus may or may not be related to the Tiny Family documented
       elsewhere in this listing.

 Virus Name:  Traceback
 Aliases:     3066
 V Status:    Endangered
 Discovered:  October, 1988
 Symptoms:    .COM & .EXE growth, TSR, graphic display 1 hour after boot
 Origin:
 Eff Length:  3,066 bytes
 Type Code:   PRsA - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions:  M-3066, VirClean, F-Prot, VirexPC, Pro-Scan 1.4+
              or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Traceback virus infects both .COM and .EXE files, adding
       3,066 bytes to the length of the file.  After an infected
       program is executed, it will install itself memory resident
       and infect other programs that are opened.  Additionally, if
       the system date is after December 5, 1988, it will attempt to
       infect one additional .COM or .EXE file in the current
       directory.  If an uninfected file doesn't exist in the current
       directory, it will search the entire disk, starting at the
       root directory, looking for a candidate.  This search
       process terminates if it encounters an infected file before
       finding a candidate non-infected file.

       This virus derives its name from two characteristics.  First,
       infected files contain the directory path of the file causing
       the infection within the viral code, thus is it possible
       to "trace back" the infection thru a number of files.  Second,
       when it succeeds in infected another file, the virus will
       attempt to access the on-disk copy of the program that the
       copy of the virus in memory was loaded from so that it can
       update a counter in the virus.  The virus takes over disk
       error handling while trying to update the original infected
       program, so if it can't infect it, the user will be unaware
       that an error occurred.

       The primary symptom of the Traceback virus having infected
       the system is that if the system date is after December 28,
       1988, the memory resident virus will produce a screen display
       with a cascading effect similar to the Cascade/1701/1704
       virus.  The cascading display occurs one hour after system
       memory is infected.  If a keystroke is entered from the key-
       board during this display, a system lockup will occur.  After
       one minute, the display will restore itself, with the characters
       returning to their original positions.  This cascade and
       restore display are repeated by the virus at one hour
       intervals.

       Known variant(s) of the Traceback virus are:
       Traceback-B : Similar to the Traceback virus, the major differences
                     are that Traceback-B will infect COMMAND.COM and there
                     is no cascading display effect after the virus has
                     been resident for one (1) hour.  Infected files will
                     also not contain the name of the file from which the
                     virus originally became memory resident, but instead
                     the name of the current file.  A text string:
                     "MICRODIC MSG" can be found in files infected with
                     Traceback-B.  If the system is booted from a diskette
                     whose copy of COMMAND.COM is infected, attempting to
                     execute any program will result in a memory allocation
                     error and the system being halted.
                     Origin: Spain, March 1990.
       Traceback-B2: Similar to Traceback-B2, this variant has the cascading
                     display effect after the virus has been resident in
                     memory for one (1) hour.  The text string " XPO DAD     "
                     replaces the "MICRODIS MSG" text string in Traceback-B.
                     Origin: Spain, May 1990.

 General Comments:
       The Traceback II virus is a variant of the Traceback (3066)
       virus.  It is believed that Traceback II predates the
       Traceback virus, however the Traceback virus was isolated
       and reported first.  As with the Traceback virus, the
       Traceback II virus is memory resident and infects both .COM
       & .EXE files.

       The comments indicated for the Traceback virus generally
       apply to the Traceback II virus, with the exception that the
       file length increase is 2,930 bytes instead of 3,066 bytes.

       Known variant(s) of the Traceback II Virus are:
       Traceback II-B: Similar to Traceback II, this variant will infect
                       COMMAND.COM.  When the cascading effect occurs, the
                       screen will not be restored, instead the system will
                       be hung requiring it to be powered off and rebooted.

 Virus Name:  Typo Boot
 Aliases:     Mistake
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  June, 1989
 Symptoms:    BSC, Resident TOM, garbled printout.
 Origin:      Israel
 Eff Length:  N/A
 Type Code:   BRt - Resident Boot Sector Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan
 Removal Instructions:  MDisk, Pro-Scan 1.4+, F-Prot, or DOS SYS Command
 General Comments:
       The Typo Boot virus was first isolated in Israel by Y. Radai
       in June, 1989.  This virus is a memory resident boot sector
       infector, taking up 2K at the upper end of system memory once
       it has installed itself memory resident.

       The major symptom that will be noticed on systems infected
       with the Typo Boot virus is that certain characters in
       printouts are always replaced with other phonetically
       similar characters.  Since the virus also substitutes hebrew
       letters for other hebrew letters, the virus was most likely
       written by someone in Israel.  Digits in numbers may also
       be transposed or replaced with other numbers.  The substitutions
       impact printouts only, the screen display and data in files are
       not affected.

       The Typo Boot virus is similar structurally to the Ping Pong
       virus, and may be a variant of Ping Pong.  It can be removed
       from a disk by using MDisk, CleanUp, DOS SYS command, or
       just about any Ping Pong disinfector.


 Virus Name:  Typo COM
 Aliases:     Fumble, 867
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  November, 1989
 Symptoms:    .COM growth, Resident TOM, garbled printout (see text).
 Origin:      England
 Eff Length:  867 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRtC - Parasitic Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V48+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan
 Removal Instructions:  Scan/D, F-Prot, Pro-Scan 1.4+,
              or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Typo COM virus is similar to the Typo Boot virus in that
       it will garble data that is sent to the parallel port once it
       has activated.  Unlike the Boot virus, the COM virus infects
       generic .COM files.  This virus was first reported by Joe
       Hirst of Brighton, UK, in November, 1989.

       The Typo COM virus only infects .COM files on even-numbered
       days.


 Virus Name:  V651
 Aliases:     Eddie 3, Stealth Virus
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  April, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM & .EXE growth, decrease in system and free memory,
              file allocation errors
 Origin:      Sofia, Bulgaria
 Eff Length:  651 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRtA - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The V651, or Eddie 3, Virus was isolated in Sofia, Bulgaria in
       April 1990 by Vesselin Bontchev.  V651 is believed to have been
       written by the same author as Dark Avenger, V1024, and V2000.
       This virus is a generic infector for .COM and .EXE files.

       The first time a program infected with V651 is executed, the virus
       will install itself memory resident.  Using the DOS CHKDSK program,
       total system memory, as well as available free memory, will be
       decreased by 688 bytes.

       Later, as programs with a length of 651 bytes or greater are executed,
       they will be infected by the virus.  Infected files increase in length
       by 651 bytes, though the increase in file length will not be seen by
       performing a directory command with the virus present in memory. The
       total available disk space will also be adjusted by the virus so that
       the decrease in available disk space due to the virus's activities
       cannot be seen.  Powering off the system and booting from a known
       clean boot diskette, followed by issuing a directory command will
       result in the correct infected file lengths being displayed as well
       as the actual available space on the disk.

       Infected files can be easily identified as the text string "Eddie
       Lives." appears near the end of the infected file.  These files will
       also be 651 bytes longer than expected when the virus is not
       present in memory.

       A side effect of the V651 virus is that lost clusters may occur on
       infected systems if the CHKDSK /F command is used.  While this does
       not occur for all infected files, the number of errors reported by
       CHKDSK will be much higher statistically when V651 is present.

       Unlike Dark Avenger and V2000, this virus does not infect
       files on any file open.  It only infects when programs are executed.

 Virus Name:  V800
 Aliases:     Live after Death Virus, Stealth Virus
 V Status:    Unknown - Eastern Block (Bulgaria)
 Discovered:  May, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM growth, decrease in total system and available memory
 Origin:      Bulgaria
 Eff Length:  800 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRC - Parasitic Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V63+ , Pro-Scan 1.4+
 Removal Instructions: CleanUp V64+, Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The V800, or Live after Death, Virus was isolated in Bulgaria by
       Vesselin Bontchev in May, 1990.  The V800 is a self-encrypting
       memory resident .COM infector, and it does not infect COMMAND.COM.
       This virus is thought to have been written by the same person as
       the Dark Avenger virus since many of the same techniques are
       used.

       The virus has received an alias of the Live after Death Virus as
       the virus contains the "Live after Death" string, though it
       cannot be seen in infected files as the virus is encrypted.

       The first time an infected program is run on a system, the V800
       Virus will install itself memory resident.  In the process of
       installing itself resident, it will decrease available system
       memory by 16K, using 8,192 Bytes for itself in the top of
       available free memory.  It will also hook interrupt 2A.

       Once in memory, every time a .COM file is attempted to be
       executed, the virus will check to see if it is a candidate for
       infection.  Whether the file will be infected depends on the
       size of the .COM file when it is attempted to be executed.  In
       no event is a .COM file smaller than 1024 bytes infected, but
       not all .COM files over 1024 bytes are infected either.

       The V800 Virus will reinfect .COM files, with the file's size
       increasing by 800 bytes with each infection.

       Known variant(s) of the V800 Virus include:
       V800M   : Very similar to V800, the major difference is that V800M
                 will infect files on both file open and file execute,
                 putting this variant into the "Stealth" virus category.
                 When the virus becomes memory resident, total system and free
                 memory will decrease by only 8,192 bytes.  This variant
                 does not have the "Live after Death" string in it.


 Virus Name:  V1024
 Aliases:     Dark Avenger III, Stealth Virus
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  May, 1990
 Symptoms:    TSR; decrease in available free memory
 Origin:      Bulgaria
 Eff Length:  1,024 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRA - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V64+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The V1024, or Dark Avenger III, Virus was discovered in Bulgaria in
       April 1990.  V1024 is a memory resident generic infector of .COM and
       .EXE files.  It is believed to have been written by the same person
       that wrote Dark Avenger and V2000.  This virus may actually be an
       earlier version of the Dark Avenger virus, it has many of the
       same characteristics, though it does not infect all files when they
       are openned for any reason.

       The first time a program infected with V1024 is executed, the virus
       will install itself memory resident.  At this time, it checks to see
       if several interrupts are being monitored, including interrupts 1
       and 3.  If interrupts 1 and 3 are monitored, V1024 allow the current
       program to run, but any subsequent program executed will hang the
       system and V1024 will not replicate.  When V1024 is memory resident,
       infected systems will experience a decrease in free memory by 1,072
       bytes.  Total system memory will not have changed.  The virus will
       have remapped several interrupts by altering their location in the
       interrupt map page in memory.  These interrupts will now be controlled
       by V1024.

       After V1024 becomes memory resident, the virus will infect any
       program executed which is greater in length than 1,024 bytes.  Both
       .COM and .EXE files are infected, COMMAND.COM is not infected.
       Infected files increase in length by 1,024 bytes, though this increase
       will not appear if the virus is present in memory and a DIR listing
       is done.

       V1024 infected files can be identified by a text string which
       appears very close to the end of infected files.  The text string is:
       '7106286813'.

       V1024 does not appear contact any activation date.

 Virus Name:  V1701New
 Aliases:     P1
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  July, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM growth, system reboots, CHKDSK program failure,
              COMMAND.COM header change
 Origin:      Bulgaria
 Eff Length:  1,701 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRhCK - Parasitic Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method: ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The V1701New virus is of Bulgarian origin, and was submitted to
       the author of this document in July, 1990 by Vesselin Bontchev.
       This virus is one of a family of three (3) viruses which may be
       referred to as the P1 or Phoenix Family.  Each of these viruses is
       being documented separately due to their varying characteristics.
       The V1701New virus is a memory resident, generic infector of .COM
       files, and will infect COMMAND.COM.  It is the most advanced of the
       three viruses in the Phoenix Family.

       The V1701New Virus is a later version of the PhoenixD virus.

       The first time a program infected with the V1701New virus is executed,
       the virus will install itself memory resident in free high memory,
       reserving 8,192 bytes.  Interrupt 2A will be hooked by the virus.
       System total memory and free memory will decrease by 8,192 bytes.
       V1701New will then check to see if the current drive's root directory
       contains a copy of COMMAND.COM.  If a copy of COMMAND.COM is found,
       it will be infected by V1701New by overwriting part of the binary zero
       portion of the program, and changing the program's header information.
       COMMAND.COM will not change in file length.  The virus will then
       similarly infect COMMAND.COM residing in the C: drive root directory.

       After becoming memory resident, the virus will attempt to infect any
       .COM file executed.  V1701New is a better replicator than either the
       original Phoenix Virus or PhoenixD, and was successful in infected .COM   Infected
       files in all cases on the author's system.  Infected files will
       increase in size by 1,701 bytes.

       V1701New is not able to recognize when it has previously infected a
       file, so it may reinfect .COM files several times.  Each infection will
       result in another 1,701 bytes of viral code being appended to the
       file.

       Like PhoenixD, V1701New will infect files when they are openned for
       any reason in addition to when they are executed.  The simple act of
       copying a .COM file will result in both the source and target .COM
       files being infected.

       Systems infected with the V1701New virus will experience problems with
       executing CHKDSK.COM.  Attempts to execute this program with Phoenix
       memory resident will result in a warm reboot of the system occurring.
       The system, however, will not perform either a RAM memory check or
       request Date and Time if an autoexec.bat file is not present.

       This virus is not related to the Cascade (1701/1704) virus.

       The V1701New Virus employs a complex encryption mechanism, and virus
       scanners which are only able to look for simple hex strings will not
       be able to detect it.  There is no simple hex string in this virus
       that is common to all infected samples.

       Known variant(s) of V1701New are:
       V1701New-B : This is a earlier version of V1701New, and is a rather
                    poor replicator.  It also has not to viable as infected
                    programs will hang when they are executed, with the
                    exception of the Runme.Exe file which the author
                    received.  The Runme.Exe file was probably the original
                    release file distributed by the virus's author.

 Virus Name:  V2000
 Aliases:     Dark Avenger II, Stealth Virus, Travel Virus
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  1989
 Symptoms:    TSR; .COM, .EXE, .OV? growth (see text); crashes;
              crosslinked files following CHKDSK.
 Origin:      Bulgaria
 Eff Length:  2,000 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRA - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V59+, Pro-Scan 1.4+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The V2000, or Dark Avenger II, virus is a memory resident generic
       file infector.  The first isolated samples of this virus were
       received from Bulgaria, where it is thought to have originated.

       V2000 will infect .COM, .EXE, and Overlay files, as well as
       COMMAND.COM.  When the first infected file is executed, the virus
       installs itself memory resident, and then infected COMMAND.COM if
       it has not already been infected.  Then, when an executable file
       is openned for any reason, it is infected if it hasn't been
       previously infected.

       Increased file lengths will not be shown if the V2000 virus is
       present in memory when a DIR command is issued.  Issuing a
       CHKDSK /F command on infected systems may result in crosslinking
       of files since the directory information may not appear to match
       the entries in the file allocation table (FAT).

       Systems infected with the V2000 virus will experience unexpected
       system crashes, resulting in lost data.  Some systems may also
       become unbootable due to the modification of COMMAND.COM or the
       hidden system files.

       One of the following two text strings will appear in the viral code
       in infected files, thus accounting for the alias of Travel Virus used in
       Bulgaria:

              "Zopy me - I want to travel"
              "Copy me - I want to travel"

       There are reports from Bulgaria that the V2000 virus looks for and
       hangs the system if programs written by Vesselin Bontchev are
       attempted to be executed.  This would explain the presence of the
       following copyright notice within the viral code:

              "(c) 1989 by Vesselin Bontchev"

       Known variants of the V2000 virus include:
       V2000-B/Die Young : Similar to the V2000 virus, the main difference is
              that the text string "Zopy me - I want to travel" is now
              "Only the Good die young..." or "Mnly the Good die young..."
              and the encryption used by the virus is different.  This
              variant is actually the original virus, predating V2000.

 Virus Name:  V2100
 Aliases:     2100, Stealth Virus, UScan Virus
 V Status:    New
 Discovered:  July, 1990
 Symptoms:    file allocation errors, decrease in system and free memory
 Origin:      Bulgaria
 Eff Length:  2,100 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRtA - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The V2100, or 2100, Virus was first isolated in Sofia, Bulgaria by
       Vesselin Bontchev in July 1990.  It is a resident generic infector
       of .COM, .EXE, and overlay files.  It will also infect COMMAND.COM.
       This virus appears to have been originally released into the public
       domain on an anti-viral program named UScan which was uploaded to
       several BBSes in Europe.  While not all copies of UScan are carriers
       of this virus, there was one version which exists that has the virus
       embedded in its program code.  The virus cannot be detected on this
       trojan version using search algorithms for this virus.  V2100 is
       believed to have been written by the author of Dark Avenger.

       The first time a program infected with V2100 is executed, the virus
       will install itself memory resident above top of memory but below
       the 640K boundary.  The top of memory returned by interrupt 12 will
       be lower than expected by 4,288 bytes.  Likewise, free memory will
       have decreased by 4,288 bytes.  At this same point, V2100 will infect
       COMMAND.COM though the change in file length will be hidden by the
       virus.

       Once the virus is memory resident, it will infect any .COM, .EXE, or
       overlay file with a file length of at least 2100 bytes that is
       executed or openned for any reason.  The simple act of copying an
       executable file will result in both the source and target files
       becoming infected.  Infected files will be 2,100 bytes longer,
       though the virus will hide the change in file length so that
       it isn't noticeable when directories are listed.  In some cases,
       infected files will appear to be 2,100 bytes smaller than expected
       if the virus is present in memory.

       Systems infected with the V2100 virus will notice file allocation
       errors occurring, along with crosslinking of files.  Due to these
       errors, some files may become corrupted.  These file allocation
       errors are truely errors, they exist whether or not the virus is
       present in memory.


 Virus Name:  Vacsina
 Aliases:
 V Status:    Endangered
 Discovered:  November, 1989
 Symptoms:    TSR; .COM, .EXE, .BIN, & .SYS growth; "beeps"
 Origin:      Bulgaria
 Eff Length:  1,206 bytes
 Type Code:   PRsA - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, F-Prot, Pro-Scan 1.4+, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: CleanUp V64+, Scan/D/A, F-Prot, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Vacsina virus is approximately 1200 bytes in length and can
       be found in memory on infected systems.  There are at least 48
       variants of the Vacsina virus, also known as the TP virus
       family, though not all of them have been isolated.  Later versions
       of this virus are included in this listing under the name
       "Yankee Doodle".

       Generally, the Vacsina Virus infects both .COM and .EXE files,
       as well as .SYS and .BIN files.  This virus, when infecting a .EXE
       file, will first convert it into .COM format by changing the MZ
       or ZM identifier in the first two bytes of the file to a JMP
       instruction and then adding a small piece of relocator code, so
       that the .EXE file can be infected as though it were originally a
       .COM file.

       One sign of a Vacsina infection is that programs which have been
       infected may "beep" when executed.  Infected programs will also
       have their date/time in the disk directory changed to the date and
       time they were infected.

       Known Vacsina Variants Include:
       TP04VIR - Infects .EXE files, changing them internally into .COM
                 files.  Infected programs may beep when executed, and
                 may be identified by searching for the text string
                 "VACSINA" along with the second byte from the end of
                 the file containing a 04h.  This version of Vacsina is
                 a poor replicator, and while it will always convert a
                 .EXE file to .COM file format, adding 132 bytes, it does
                 not always infect executed files.
       TP05VIR - Similar to TP04VIR, except that the second to the last
                 byte in the file is now a 05h.  System hangs may also
                 be experienced.
       TP06VIR - Similar to TP05VIR, except the second to the last byte in
                 the file is now a 06h.
       TP16VIR - Similar to TP06VIR, the second to the last byte in the
                 infected file is now 10h.
       TP23VIR - Similar to TP16VIR, the second to the last byte in the
                 infected file is now 17h.  The text "VACSINA" no longer
                 appears in the virus.
       TP24VIR - Similar to TP23VIR, the second to the last byte in the
                 infected file is now 18h.
       TP25VIR - Similar to TP24VIR, the second to the last byte in the

 Virus Name:  VComm
 Aliases:     637
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  December, 1989
 Symptoms:    .EXE growth, TSR, write failures
 Origin:      Poland
 Eff Length:  637 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRaE - Parasitic Resident .EXE Infector
 Detection Method: F-Prot, ViruScan V60+, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: F-Prot, Scan/D, VirexPC, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Vcomm virus is of Polish origin, first isolated in
       December, 1989.  The virus is a .EXE file infector.  When an
       infected file is run, the virus will attempt to infect one
       .EXE file in the current directory.  It will also infect the
       memory resident version of the system's command interpreter.

       When Vcomm infects a file, it first pads the file so that the
       files length is a multiple of 512 bytes, then it adds its
       637 bytes of virus code to the end of the file.

       The memory resident portion of the virus intercepts any
       disk writes that are attempted, and changes them into disk
       reads.


 Virus Name:  VHP
 Aliases:     VHP-348, VHP-353, VHP-367, VHP-435
 V Status:    Endangered
 Discovered:  July 1989
 Symptoms:    .COM growth, system hangs
 Origin:      Bulgaria
 Eff Length:  348 - 435 Bytes
 Type Code:   PNC - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V64+
 Removal Instructions:  Scan/D, or Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The VHP Virus is actually a small group or "family" of viruses that
       was discovered in Bulgaria in early 1990.  There are currently four
       identified variants to the VHP Virus, with the VHP-435 variant being
       the one with the most potential for spreading.  These viruses were
       originally based on the Vienna virus.  The progression of the
       variants shows each variant to be a slightly better replicator.

       The VHP Viruses are:
       VHP-348  : This variant does not replicate due to bugs in the
                  virus code.  If it did replicate, it would infect
                  .COM files.  The virus's effective length is 348 bytes.
       VHP-353  : VHP-348 fixed so that it will infected COMMAND.COM,
                  increasing its size by 353 bytes.  It does not infect
                  other .COM files.  This variant is still buggy, and it
                  will occasionally hang systems when attempting to find
                  a .COM file to infect.
       VHP-367  : VHP-353 which will now infect .COM files besides
                  COMMAND.COM.  Infected files increase in size by 367
                  bytes.  Very rarely, this virus will reinfect an infected
                  .COM file.  VHP-353 does not always infect a .COM file
                  when an infected program is executed, it will sometimes
                  not infect any .COM file, though it has in effect
                  immunized the file from infection.  This effect is
                  probably a bug in this variant.
       VHP-435  : Isolated in July, 1989, this variant is 435 bytes in
                  length and is not destructive, all it does is spread.
                  VHP-435 will attempt to infect 1 file each time an
                  infected program is executed. COMMAND.COM and .EXE
                  files are not infected.  After infecting all of the
                  .COM files on the current drive and directory, it will
                  attempt to infect drive C:.   VHP-435 is the VHP-367
                  virus with some modifications to make it less likely to
                  be noticed.

 Virus Name:  VHP2
 Aliases:     VHP-623
 V Status:    Endangered
 Discovered:  March, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM growth, reboots or system hangs
 Origin:      Bulgaria
 Eff Length:  623 bytes
 Type Code:   PNC - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V64+, Pro-Scan 1.4+
 Removal Instructions:  Scan/D, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The VHP2 Virus was isolated in Bulgaria in March, 1990.  This virus
       is based on the Vienna Virus, and has many of the same characteristics
       of the VHP-435 variant of the VHP virus.  It's major difference is that     every 8 infected programs will perform a system warm reboot
       of effective length.  VHP2 is 623 bytes long, infecting only .COM
       files but not COMMAND.COM.

       Known variants of the Vienna Virus include:
       VHP-627  : Similar to VHP-623, except that its length is 627 bytes.

 Virus Name:  Victor
 Aliases:
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  May, 1990
 Symptoms:    .COM &.EXE growth, data file corruption, file linkage errors,
              and unexpected system reboots
 Origin:      USSR
 Eff Length:  2,458 bytes
 Type Code:   PRAK - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V63+, Pro-Scan 1.4+, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions:  Scan/D, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Victor Virus was first isolated in May, 1990.  It is believed
       to have originated in the USSR due to messages which appear within
       the viral code:

          "Victor V1.0 The Incredible High Performance Virus
           Enhanced versions available soon.
           This program was imported from USSR.
           Thanks to Ivan."

       The above message can be found at the end of infected files, but
       does not appear to ever be displayed.

       The first time a program infected with the Victor Virus is executed,
       the virus will install itself memory resident, occuping 3,072 bytes
       at the top of free memory.  Interrupt 21 will be intercepted by
       the virus.  After becoming memory resident, Victor will then
       seek out and infect COMMAND.COM.

       Victor is a very slow file infector, only infected approximately
       1 in every 10 programs executed after it becomes memory resident.
       Infected programs will increase in length by between 2,443 and
       2,458 bytes.  The increase in file size is not hidden by the
       virus.

       Occasionally in the process of infecting a file, the virus will
       hang the system, which may result in data file corruption.
       Overlay files may also be infected, resulting in file linkage
       errors.


 Virus Name:  Vienna

 V Status:    Endangered
 Discovered:  April, 1988
 Symptoms:    .COM growth, reboots or system hangs
 Origin:      Austria
 Eff Length:  648 bytes
 Type Code:   PNC - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions:  M-Vienna, CleanUp V66+, VirClean, F-Prot,
              Pro-Scan 1.4+, or VirexPC
 General Comments:
       The Vienna virus was first isolated in April, 1988, in Moscow at
       a UNESCO children's computer summer camp.  The virus will infect
       1 .COM file whenever a program infected with the virus is run.
       1 in every 8 infected programs will perform a system warm reboot
       whenever the viral code is executed.  Some .COM programs
       infected with this virus may not run.

       The Vienna virus was written by a high school student in Vienna
       Austria as an experiment.  Its large number of variants can be
       accounted for as its source code has been published many times.

       Known variants of the Vienna Virus include:
       Vienna-B : Similar to Vienna, except that instead of a warm reboot,
                  the program being executed will be deleted.
       Vienna-B 645 : Similar to the Vienna-B variant, this variant's
                  effective length is 645 bytes.  It does not perform either
                  a warm reboot or delete executed programs.  It does,
                  however, infect COMMAND.COM
                  Origin: United States
       Vien6    : Similar to Vienna, except that the warm reboot has been
                  removed.  Effective length of the virus is still 648 bytes.
                  After 7 files have become infected on the current drive,
                  the virus will then start infecting .COM files on drive C:.

 Virus Name:  VirDem
 Aliases:
 V Status:    Endangered
 Discovered:  1986-1987
 Symptoms:    .COM growth, Messages
 Origin:      Germany
 Eff Length:  1,236 Bytes
 Type Code:   PNC - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  VirexPC
 Removal Instructions:
 General Comments:
       The VirDem Virus was written in 1986-1987 by Ralf Burger of Germany.
       The virus was originally distributed in Europe as a demonstration
       virus, to assist computer users in understanding how a computer
       virus operates.

       The VirDem virus is not memory resident, and only infects .COM files
       on the A: drive.  It will always skip the first .COM file in the
       root directory, so normally it will not infect COMMAND.COM.  It will
       also not infect .COM files past the second subdirectory on the disk.

       Infected files that were originally less than approximately 1,500
       bytes will be 2,616 bytes after infection.  .COM files which were
       greater than 1,500 bytes will increase in size by approximately
       1,236 bytes.

       When an infected program is executed, VirDem will infect the next
       candidate .COM file.  Infected files will contain the viral code,
       followed by the original program.  After infecting the .COM file,
       the virus will play a "game" with you, starting with the following
       text being displayed:

              " VirDem Ver.: 1.06 (Generation #) aktive.
                Copyright by R.Burger 1986,1987
                Phone.: D - xxxxx/xxxx

                This is a demoprogram for
                computerviruses. Please put in a
                number now.
                If you're right, you'll be
                able to continue.
                The number is between
                0 and #                                         "

               (Note: I have removed the phone number here, but it
                appears where xxxxx/xxxx is above.  Where # is, the
                virus's generation number appears.)

       At this point, you must guess the correct number and enter it.  If
       you put in the wrong number, you get the following message and
       your program is not run:

              " Sorry, you're wrong

                More luck at next try ....    "

       If you guess the correct number, you receive the following message
       and your program then executes:

              " Famous. You're right.
                You'll be able to continue.  "

       Finally, after all the candidate .COM files on the A: drive are
       infected, the following message is displayed:

              " All your programs are
                struck by VIRDEM.COM now."

       VIRDEM.COM was the original distribution file containing the virus,
       and had a VIRDEM.DOC file included with it.  VirDem is not widespread,
       and is not distructive.

       source also available for sale.  In January, 1990, the
       author contacted the sites where he had uploaded the virus
       requesting that they remove it from their systems, his having
       decided a live virus was not a "good idea" for an educational
       tool after being contacted by several viral authorities.

 General Comments:
       The Virus101 is the "big brother" of Virus-90, also written by
       Patrick Toulme as an "educational tool" in January 1990.
       This virus is memory resident, and employs an encryption scheme
       to avoid detection on files.  It infects COMMAND.COM, and all
       other executable file types.  Once it has infected all the
       files on a diskette, it will infect the diskette's boot
       sector.  It only infects floppy diskettes in its current
       version.

 Type Code:   PNCK - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method: ViruScan V64+, Pro-Scan 1.4+
 Removal Instructions:  Scan/D, Pro-Scan 1.4+, or Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The VP Virus was first isolated in May, 1990.  It is a non-resident
       generic .COM infector, and will infect COMMAND.COM.  When an
       infected program is run, the virus will attempt to locate and
       infect another .COM file.  In some cases, such as COMMAND.COM, the
       virus will display the contents of the program being infected.  In
       other cases, the virus may attempt to execute the program being
       infected.  Infected files increase in length by 913 bytes, and
       can be identified as the following hex string will appear near both
       the beginning and the end of an infected program: '4503EB1808655650'.

 Removal Instructions:  Scan/D, F-Prot, Pro-Scan 1.4+,
              or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The W13 virus is a .COM file infector that doesn't do much
       except for infect files.  The virus was isolated in December
       1989 in Poland.

       While W13 is based on the Vienna virus, it does not damage files
       or have some of the other side effects of the Vienna virus.  It
       contains a number of bugs which prevent it from being a good
       replicator.

       Known variant(s) of W13 include:
       W13-B     : The original W13 Virus with several bugs fixed.  This
                   variants length is 507 bytes instead of 534 bytes.

 Eff Length:  2,064 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRsAK - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V66+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or Delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Wolfman Virus was discovered in Taiwan in July, 1990.  It is a
       memory resident generic infector of .COM and .EXE files, including
       COMMAND.COM.

       The first time a program infected with the Wolfman Virus is executed,
       the virus will install itself memory resident as a TSR with 2 blocks
       of memory reserved.  The first block of memory reserved is 68,032
       bytes in length, the second block of reserved memory is 4,544 bytes
       in length.  The total 72,640 bytes of memory is in low system memory,
       and available free memory is decreased by a corresponding amount.
       The virus hooks interrupts 09, 10, 16, 21, 2F, ED, and F5.

       Once the virus is memory resident, the virus will infect any .COM or
       .EXE file which is executed if the pre-infection file length is
       greater than or equal to 2,064 bytes.  Infected files increase in
       length by 2,064 bytes.  .COM files which are infected will have the
       virus's code located at the beginning of the .COM file, .EXE files
       will have the virus located at the end.

       It is unknown when Wolfman activates, or if it is destructive.

 Type Code:   PRsA - Parasitic Resident .COM & .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V42+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: CleanUp V64+, Scan/D, VirClean, F-Prot, or
              delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Yankee Doodle virus was isolated by Alexander Holy of
       the North Atlantic Project in Vienna, Austria, on
       September 30, 1989.  It was also isolated in Bulgaria shortly
       thereafter, where it is known as TP44VIR.

       This virus is a parasitic virus which infects both .COM and .EXE
       files, and installs itself memory resident.  After installing itself
       memory resident, it will play Yankee Doodle on the system speaker at
       17:00.  Infected programs will be increased in length by 2,899 bytes.

       Other than being disruptive by playing Yankee Doodle, this
       virus currently does nothing else harmful besides infecting
       files.

       As a side note, some variants of the Yankee Doodle Virus will seek
       out and modify Ping Pong viruses, changing them so that they self-
       destruct after 100 infections.

       Known variants of the Yankee Doodle Virus are:
       TP33VIR - This variant disables interrupts 1 and 3, thus interfering
                 with using debuggers to isolate it.  The behavior of the
                 virus also has been changed so that it infected programs
                 will play Yankee Doodle at 5PM.  The second to the last
                 byte in infected files is the virus's "version number",
                 in the case of TP33VIR, it is 21h (33 in hex).
       TP34VIR - Similar to TP33VIR, except that this variant is memory
                 resident, and infects programs as they are executed.
                 The second to the last byte in infected files is 22h.
       TP38VIR - Similar to TP34VIR, except that .COM and .EXE files are
                 handled in a different way, and this variant will
                 disinfect itself if it is loaded with CodeView active in
                 memory.  The second to the last byte in infected files
                 is 26h.  TP38VIR was first isolated in Bulgaria in
                 July 1988, and is the oldest virus known in Bulgaria.
       TP41VIR - Similar to TP38VIR, except the second to the last byte
                 in infected files is 29h.
       TP42VIR - This variant of Vacsina tests to determine if the system
                 is infected with the Ping Pong virus, and if it is, will
                 attempt to disable the Ping Pong virus by modifying it.
                 The second to the last byte in infected files is now 2Ah.
       TP44VIR - Similar to TP42VIR, the second to the last byte of infected
                 files is 2Ch.
       TP45VIR - Similar to TP44VIR, the second to the last byte of infected
                 files is 2Dh.
       TP46VIR - Similar to TP45VIR, except that this variant can detect
                 and kill the Cascade (1701) Virus.  The second to the last
                 byte of infected files is now 2Eh.
       Yankee Doodle-B: Very similar to the Yankee Doodle virus, except
                 the length of the viral code is 2,772 bytes.

 Virus Name:  Yankee 2
 Aliases:     Yankee Virus, 1961
 V Status:    Endangered
 Discovered:  September, 1989
 Symptoms:    .EXE growth, Yankee Doodle
 Origin:      Bulgaria
 Eff Length:  1,961 Bytes
 Type Code:   PNE - Parasitic Non-Resident .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V62+, Pro-Scan 1.4+, Virex PC
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Yankee 2, or Yankee Virus, was isolated in Bulgaria
       in 1989.  Unlike the Yankee Doodle Virus, the Yankee 2
       Virus is not memory resident.  It also only infects .EXE files,
       adding 1,961 bytes to their length.  The virus will attempt to
       infect an .EXE file in the current directory whenever an
       infected program is executed.  If it is successful in locating
       an uninfected .EXE file, and infects it, Yankee Doodle will be
       played on the system speaker.  Infected files will have the
       hex string '6D6F746865726675636B6572' at the end.

       The Yankee 2 Virus will not infect CodeView.


 Virus Name:  Zero Bug
 Aliases:     Palette, 1536
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovered:  September, 1989
 Symptoms:    .COM growth (see text), TSR, graphics display
 Origin:      Netherlands
 Eff Length:  1,536 bytes
 Type Code:   PRsC - Parasitic Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  Viruscan V38+, F-Prot, Pro-Scan 1.4+, VirexPC
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, CleanUp V66+, F-Prot, Pro-Scan 1.4+,
              or delete infected files
 General Comments:
       The Zero Bug virus was first isolated in the Netherlands by
       Jan Terpstra in September, 1989.  This virus is a memory
       resident .COM file infector.  Infected .COM files will
       increase in size by 1,536 bytes, however the increase in file
       length will not show up when the disk directory is displayed.

       The virus's main objective is to infect the copy of
       COMMAND.COM indicated by the environment variable COMSPEC.
       If COMSPEC doesn't point to anything, the Zero Bug virus will
       install itself memory resident using INT 21h.

       After the virus has either infected COMMAND.COM or become
       memory resident, it will infect all .COM files that are
       accessed, including those accessed by actions such as COPY or
       XCOPY.  Any .COM file created on an infected system will also
       be infected.

       If the currently loaded COMMAND.COM is infected, the virus
       will hook into the timer interrupt 1Ch, and after a certain
       amount of time has past, a smiley face character (ASCII 01)
       will appear and eat all the zeros it can find on the screen.
       The virus does not delete files or format disks in its present
       form.
