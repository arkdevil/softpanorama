     SHEZ is a shell program to make viewing and working with archive files user
     friendly.  In order for SHEZ to function you must have one or more of the
     following archive programs:
         PKZIP, PKUNZIP by Phil Katz for ZIP files.
         PKUNPAK, PKPAK by Phil Katz for ARC files.
         LHARC by Haruyasu Yoshizaki for LZH files.
         ZOO by Rahul Dhesi for ZOO files.
         PAK by NoGate Consulting for PAK files.

     In addition you will need Vern Buerg's LIST program.

     QUICK START

     To start-up SHEZ simply enter "SHEZ [d:\path\filespec]".  You may specify
     wild cards in the filespec. If you use wild cards in the filespec SHEZ will
     present you with a scrollable list of files that it found matching the
     filespec. SHEZ recognizes the special filename.fileext of $.$.  If you
     specify a filespec of $.$ SHEZ will list only the files having an extension
     of .ARC, .ZIP, .LZH, and ZOO, or the files having extension matching the
     extensions that where set using the configuration program. SHEZ will also
     recognize just the $ file extension along with a DOS wildcard filename. For
     example if you start SHEZ by entering SHEZ C:\UTY\P*.$ SHEZ will display a
     list of files that have a filename beginning with the letter P and that
     have a file extension of .ARC,.ZIP,.LZH,.ZOO,.PAK, or what ever you set the
     extentions to using the config. program.

     You may also start SHEZ and specify a sub-directory name of the directory
     you are currently in.  For example, if you are currently in the C:\UTILITY
     directory and you want to work on the files in the C:\UTILITY\PGMS
     directory start SHEZ by entering the following: SHEZ PGMS\


     Also included in the file list will be any directories that SHEZ found.
     The directory names will be enclosed in greater than and less than symbols.
     I.E. <DIR1>.  You can position the highlight bar on a directory name and
     press the enter key to view the files and directories that are contained in
     that directory.  To move up one level in the directory tree highlight the
     directory entry that appears as <..>.  As you change directories the full
     disk:\pathname will be displayed on the main screen.  In addition the
     disk:\path that will receive extracted files is also displayed on the main
     screen. You can than choose the file you wish to work on by moving the
     highlight bar with the cursor keys and pressing the enter key. SHEZ will
     then present you with a screen showing the contents of the archive file.


     To perform a function, simply position the highlight bar and press the
     key(s) that corresponds to the function you want to perform on that member.
     Pressing the F1 key will open a window giving you context sensitive help.

     SHEZ also has a built-in menuing system. To activate the menu system press
     the forward slash key.  A menu bar will appear at the top of the screen.
     Using the left and right cursor keys you may select major menu item. Press
     the enter key to view the choices under the menu item.  Using the up and
     down cursor keys you may choose an action item and then press the enter key
     to perform that item.  Pressing the ESC key will take you back one level.
     Keep pressing the ESC key to exit the menu system.

     There are two functions that can only be activated via the menuing system.
     Printing a file contained in an archive file, and setting the default
     compressing factor.  There are no hots keys associated with these
     functions.

|    SHEZ will optionally swap 90% of its code out of memory when you:

         1)  Shell to DOS


                         SHEZ VERSION 5.5 USER MANUAL                   Page -4-



         2)  Execute the edit function.
         3)  Run a program contained in a compressed file.

     This allows you to run most programs from within SHEZ without running out
     of memory.  The swapping routine was developed by Curtis Little and works
     very nicely as well as being fast.  The default for SHEZ is not to use this
     swapping function.  However this can be changed via the configuration
     program. The swapping function will swap as much of SHEZ as possible out of
     DOS memory and into either EMS (3.2 or 4.0) memory, if available, or to the
     currently active default disk.

     PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU ARE RUNNING A SYSTEM WITHOUT A HARD DISK OR WITHOUT EMS
     MEMORY DO NOT ACTIVATE THIS OPTION.

     USING THE MOUSE WITH VERN BUERG'S LIST PROGRAM.

         I have had numerous questions on how to allow the mouse to function
         when viewing a file via Vern's list program.  In order to allow the
         mouse to function within list you must "CLONE" the mouse option into
         the list program.  You must be using LIST PLUS version 7.2 in order to
         use the mouse.  To clone the mouse option change to the directory that
         contains the LIST.COM program, then start the LIST program from the DOS
         prompt and include the mouse command line option /M.  I.E. LIST /M.
         When the first screen appears press ALT-C to modify LIST.COM to always
         startup with the mouse option.  If you need further infomation on
         cloning the list program please see the documentation included with
         LIST.

                FUNCTION SUPPORTED WHEN DIRECTORY WINDOW IS DISPLAYED

     Specify where to put extracted files - ALT-P
         This options will prompt you to enter a drive and directory of where to
         place files that you extract from the archive.  This location will
         remain in effect until you enter the ALT-P command again and clear the
         drive and directory or you change to another archive file. This command
         is used when you want to place extracted files in a location other than
         the current drive and directory.

         If you specify a directory that does not exist a ERROR/INFORMATION
         window will appear indicating that the directory does not exist.  You
         may press the F10 key to create the directory.

|        This command may be issued at any time.

|        When the input window appears pressing the F9 key will open another
|        window which will display a scrollable list of directories. To display
|        a list of directories other than on the current drive, enter the drive
|        letter followed by a colon, then press the F9 key.  Scroll the list
|        using the up and down cursor keys, and press the ENTER key to select
|        the directory you wish to extract files into.

     Create a new archive file - F7
         This option allows you to create a new compressed file.  For further
         information see the section titled, CREATING NEW COMPRESSED FILES,
         later in this document.

     Show help screen - F1
         This will display a help screen showing all currently supported
         commands.  Any command can be entered while the help screen is
         displayed.

     Temporary exit to DOS - F10
         This will temporarily clear the screen and exit to DOS. You can then
         execute and command you want.  To return to SHEZ type in EXIT at the
         DOS prompt and press return.

     Select a new archive file - F2
         This option will prompt you to enter a new disk, directory, and
         filespec to find another archive file to work with.
         If you enter a filespec of $.$ SHEZ will only list directory entries
         and file that have extensions of .ARC, .ZIP, .LZH, PAK, and ZOO.

|        When the input window appears pressing the F9 key will open another
|        window which will display a scrollable list of directories. To display
|        a list of directories other than on the current drive, enter the drive
|        letter followed by a colon, then press the F9 key.  Scroll the list
|        using the up and down cursor keys, and press the ENTER key to select
|        the directory you wish to change to.

     View a file - F3


                        SHEZ VERSION 5.5 USER MANUAL                   Page -10-



         This option will allow you to view any file that is listed in the main
         file window.  Simply highlight the file you wish to view by using the
         cursor keys then press the F3 key.  The list program will be invoked
         allowing you to view the contents of the file.

|        (ALSO SEE CTRL-ENTER FOR ALTERNATE FILE VIEWERS)

     Delete a DOS file - F4
         This option allows you to delete the file that is currently highlighted
         in the file window.  Please note will be asked if you want to delete
         the file. Respond Y if you wish to delete the file, anything else will
         abort the delete.
         The deleted file name will not be removed from the displayed list.
         Instead it will be flagged with an # to the left of the filename and a
         'd' to the right.

     Display files statistics - F5
         This option will display the highlighted file's Date, Time, and Size.

     Sort the file list - F6
         This option will sort the file list that appears on the left side of
         the screen. You will be asked if you want the list sorted by filename,
|        file extension, file date, or file size.  Any directories that are
|        found will be sorted on top.

     Convert highlighted file - ALT-V
         This option will convert the highlighted file to another archive
         method.  A list will appear showing the available compression
         alternatives that SHEZ has been configured for.  Using the mouse or
         cursor keys highlight the compression method you wish to convert to,
         then press the enter key. You may also press the ESC key to cancel the
         conversion process.   The converted file will be placed into the same
         directory as the original file, and the original file will remain
         intact.

     Convert all tagged files - CTL-V
         This option will convert all tagged files to another archive method. A
         list will appear showing the available compression alternatives that
         SHEZ has been configured for.  Using the mouse or cursor keys highlight
         the compression method you wish to convert to, then press the enter
         key. You may also press the ESC key to cancel the conversion process.
         The converted file will be placed into the same directory as the
         original file, and the original file will remain intact.

     Convert highlighted file to a SFX file - F8
         This option will convert the highlighted compressed file into a Self
         extracting file.
         (Currently only files in the ZIP,LZH, and PAK formats may be converted)

         If you are converting a ZIP file that was created using version 1.1 of
         PKZIP, SHEZ will first attempt to create a MINI Self extracting file.
         If that fails than a normal Self extracting file will be created. See
         the PKZIP documentation for more on MINI self extracting files.

                             NOTES ON CREATING SFX FILES
         To convert a ZIP file to self extracting file the program, ZIP2EXE.EXE,
         and the file PKSFX.PRG, must be in the current directory or in a
         directory that is defined in your PATH.

         When a PAK file is converted the PAK file is replaced by the self
         extracting file.  For example:  If tell SHEZ to convert a file named
         TEST.PAK in the directory C:\TEST the TEST.PAK file will be deleted
         from the C:\TEST directory and will be replaced by the file TEST.EXE.
         This is not a function of SHEZ it is a function of the PAK compression
         program.

         When an LZH file is converted to a self extracting file the LHARC
         program will created either a .COM file or a .EXE file, depending on
         the size of the LZH file.

     Convert Tagged files to SFX files - SFT-F8
         This option will convert all tagged compressed files into Self
         extracting files.  See the F8 option above for additional information
         on creating SFX files.


     Write out configuration information - ALT-W
         This option will write out a file named SHEZ.CFG. This file will
         contain the current SHEZ configuration options.  This file can then be
         used to set the configuration options in future releases of SHEZ by
         using the SHEZCFG program. (See Section titled CLONING THE
         CONFIGURATION).

     Copy highlighted file CTL-F2
         This option allows you to copy the highlighted file.  When prompted for
         the location to copy to you may enter the target directory name along
         with an optional filename and extension.  If the filename and extension
         are not supplied SHEZ will use the original filename and extension.
         You may also use the * wildcard character for either the filename
         and/or the extension.  If you use the * character SHEZ will use the
         original filename and/or extension when copying the file.
         I.E. From: = C:\UTILITY\ANY.ZIP
                To: = C:\WORK\NEW.*

         This will create a file named NEW.ZIP in the \WORK directory.

|        The new file will have the orginial file's time and date stamp.

         This option allows you to move the highlighted file.
         When prompted for the location to move to you may enter the target
         directory name along with an optional filename and extension.  If the
         filename and extension are not supplied SHEZ will use the original
         filename and extension.
         The moved file name will not be removed from the displayed list.
         Instead it will be flagged with an # to the left of the filename and a
         'm' to the right.

     Rename highlighted file CTL-F6
         This option allows you to rename the highlighted file.  You must at
         least provide a filename and extension.

     Toggle the Tag status - SPACE
         Pressing the space bar will toggle the tagged status of the currently
         highlighted file. A check mark to the left of the filename indicates
         that it is tagged.

|        As files are tagged and untagged a count of the number of files tagged
|        along with the total size of all tagged files is updated on the main
|        screen.

     Tag All Files - CTL-SPACE
         This option will tag all files

     Untag all Files - CTL-U
         This option will untag all tagged files.

     Add/Update compressed file comments - ALT-C
         This option allows you to add/update the file comment records in all
         tagged compressed files.  To use this option first create an ASCII file
         that contains the file comments you wish to add to the compressed
         files.  Then tag the files you wish to update, and press the ALT-C
         keys.  You will be prompted for the ASCII file that contains your
         comment record(s). SHEZ will then execute the appropriate compressed
         file maintenance program to add/update the file comments in each tagged
         compressed file.

     Immediate Exit ALT-Q
         This option will immediately exit SHEZ.

     Test tagged compressed file(s) for viruses - ALT-Z
         Using this option SHEZ interfaces with the virus scan program
         (SCAN.EXE) that is produced by McAfee Associates.  You must have
         version 39 or greater of this scan program in order for SHEZ to use it
         correctly.

         First tag all the compressed files in the directory window that you
         wish to test.  Then press the ALT-Z keys, or use the drop down menus.
         SHEZ will extract all .COM, .EXE, and .OV? files into its working
         directory for each tagged compressed file, and will execute the virus
         scan program to determine if any of the program files have been
         infected. If an infected program is found SHEZ will temporarily suspend
         it's processing allowing you to see which programs are infected.  You
         may then press any key to continue scanning the rest of the tagged
         files.  (See the configuration section of this manual for more
         infomation on configuring SHEZ for this option).

                    FUNCTIONS WHEN VIEW CONTENTS OF ARCHIVE FILE:

     Viewing a file - V
         Simply press the return key or the V key. This will temporarily unpack
         the file and will invoke the LIST program allowing you to view the file
         on your screen.  The temporary copy of the extracted file will be
         placed in the current disk and directory unless you specified a work
         disk to be used by using the configuration program.

         Release 4.3 of SHEZ will now allow you to operate on compressed files
         that are contained within compressed files.  I.E. A zip file that
         contains zip files.  To view the contents of the embedded compressed
         file simply move the highlight bar to the compressed file and press the
         ENTER key.  The embedded compress file contents will now be displayed
         on the screen.  You may view any of the files and/or extract any of the
         files contained in the compressed file.  However you may not add,
         delete, or update the embedded compressed file.

     Extracting a single file - E.
         This will extract the file that is being pointed to.  The extracted
         file will be placed on the current disk in the current directory. You
         may optionally use the ALT-P command to direct the extracted files to a
         different disk and/or directory.

     Testing archive integrity - T
         This will test the integrity of the archive file and will report the
         results on the screen.

     Display Info about archive file - I
         This will display information about the archive file in a small pop-up
         window at the top of the screen.  The information will include the
         number of files in the archive, the date of the newest file in the
         archive,  the total size of all the files in the archive including the
         total expanded size and total compressed size. It will also display the
         current default compression factor.

     Delete a file from the archive - D
         This will delete the selected file from the archive file. Before the
         file is deleted a prompt will appear asking for verification of the
         delete. In addition any files that were previously tagged will have the
         tag cleared.

     Delete a tagged files from an archive - CTL-D
         This command will deleted all tagged files from the archive file.
         Before the files are deleted a prompt will appear asking for
         verification of the delete operation.

     Add file(s) to archive     - A
     Update files(s) in archive - U
     Move files(s) to archive   - M
     Freshen file(s) in archive - F
         Each of these options will cause a small window to open at the bottom
         of the screen.  The window will prompt you to enter one or more file
         specifications. These filespecs can include drive, path, and a filespec
         with wild cards.  All files matching the indicated filespec will be
         added, updated, moved or freshened in the current archive file
         depending on which option you initially picked. Any files that were
         previously tagged will have the tag cleared.

         For example if you enter a U to update files in the archive and you
         enter c:\source\*.c  d:\batch\*.c when prompted to enter a filespec,
         than all files on the C drive in the source directory that have a file
         extension of C, and all files on the D drive in the batch directory
         that have an extension of bat, will be updated in the current archive
         file.

     List of files to add to archive     - ALT-A
     List of files to freshen in archive - ALT-F
     List of files to move to archive    - ALT-M
     List of files to update in archive  - ALT-U
         Again each of these options will cause a small window to open at the
         bottom of the screen.  The window will prompt you to enter a filespec.
         This filespec can include drive, path, and a filespec with wild cards.
         When you press the return key another window will pop-up on the left
         side of the screen showing you all the files that were found that
         matched the filespec you entered. You can then use the cursor keys to
         scroll the file list.  Pressing the space bar will toggle the tagged
         status of the current highlighted file. When you are done tagging file
         press the return key and all files that you tagged will be added,
         freshened, moved, or updated in the current archive file.

     Specify where to put extracted files - ALT-P
         This options will prompt you to enter a drive and directory of where to
         place files that you extract from the archive.  This location will
         remain in effect until you enter the ALT-P command again and clear the
         drive and directory or you change to another archive file. This command
         is used when you want to place extracted files in a location other than
         the current drive and directory.

         If you specify a directory that does not exist a ERROR/INFORMATION
         window will appear indicating that the directory does not exist.  You
         may press the F10 key to create the directory.

|        This command may be issued at any time.

|        When the input window appears pressing the F9 key will open another
|        window which will display a scrollable list of directories. To display
|        a list of directories other than on the current drive, enter the drive
|        letter followed by a colon, then press the F9 key.  Scroll the list
|        using the up and down cursor keys, and press the ENTER key to select
|        the directory you wish to extract files into.

     Extract all files from archive - ALT-X
         This command will extract all files from the archive file and place
         them in the current disk:\directory unless you specified a different
         extract location by using the ALT-P command.

     Delete all extracted files - ALT-D
         This command will delete all files in the current disk:\directory, or
         the one specified by the ALT-P command, that are also contained in the
         archive file.  The files will only be deleted if the file time and date
         are equal to or less then the file time and date of the same file that
         is contained in the copressed file. NOTE: it does not delete anything
         from the archive file.  This is useful when you extract file from the
         archive file and then you want to quickly delete all the extracted
         files.

     Execute a file in an archive file - R
         This command will execute the EXE or COM file that is currently
         highlighted on the archive file list.  The EXE or COM file will be
         extracted from the archive file and will be placed on the current disk
         in the current directory. You will then be prompted to enter any
         optional command line parameters that the program is expecting. The
         selected program will then be executed.  After the program is run the
         extracted file will be deleted. NOTE: You can specify a different disk
         drive to place the extracted file on by using the SHEZFG program.  This
         is useful when working with archive files that are on floppy disks.  If
         you specify disk C as the work disk in the SHEZFG program the extracted
         file will be placed on the C drive, will be executed from the C drive,
         and then will be deleted from the C drive.

     Speed search - ALT-S
         This option will allow you to quickly find a file in an archive. A
         window will pop-up asking you to enter the first letter  or digit of
         the file you wish to find.  The list of files on the screen will then
         be scrolled to the first file that starts with the letter you entered.

     Immediate Exit - ALT-Q
         This option will immediately exit SHEZ.

     Extract all tagged files - CTRL-E
         This option will extract all files that you tagged in the archive file.
         To tag a file simply press the space bar to toggle the tagged status.
         When a file is tagged it will be highlighted on the screen.

     Toggle the Tag status - SPACE
         Pressing the space bar will toggle the tagged status of the currently
         highlighted file. A check mark to the left of the filename indicates
         that it is tagged.

     Untag all tagged files - CTRL-U
         This option will untag all files that you previously tagged.

     Tag All Files - CTL-SPACE
         This option will tag all files

     Update the archive files time and date - CTRL-T
         This option will change the archive file's time and date to match the
         time and date of the newest file in the archive file.

     Create a new archive file - C
         This option allows you to create a new compressed file.  For further
         information see the section titled, CREATING NEW COMPRESSED FILES,
         later in this document.

     Show help screen - F1
         This will display a help screen showing all currently supported
         commands.  Any command can be entered while the help screen is
         displayed.

     Temporary exit to DOS - F10
         This will temporarily clear the screen and exit to DOS. You can then
         execute and command you want.  To return to SHEZ type in EXIT at the
         DOS prompt and press return.

     Select a new archive file - F2
         This option will prompt you to enter a new disk, directory, and
         filespec to find another archive file to work with.
         If you enter a filespec of $.$ SHEZ will only list directory entries
         and file that have extensions of .ARC, .ZIP, .LZH, .PAK,  and .ZOO.

     Sort the archive file list - F9
         This option will allow you to sort the archive file list by Name,
|        Extension, Date, or Size.  A small window will open up asking you how
|        you want the list sorted.  Enter a N, E, D, or S.

     Edit the selected file - F8
         This option will extract the selected file onto either the default disk
         or the work disk specified via the configuration program.  It will then
         invoke the editor specified via the configuration program passing the
         selected filename.ext to the editor.  When you exit your editor SHEZ
         will then MOVE the extracted file back into the archive and delete the
         extracted copy. If an editor was not specified during the configuration
         process this command will not function.

     Specify an archive file mask - Z
         This option allows you to display only the files in the archive that
         match the file mask.  The file mask uses the same wild card conventions
         as DOS.

     Toggle overwrite mode - O
         This option toggle overwrite mode on and off.  When overwrite mode is
         in effect an 'O' will appear in the upper right hand corner of the
         screen.  When overwrite mode is in effect, and you extract a file from
         an archive, it will be extracted even if it already exists on the
         target disk:\path.

     Add Update File Comments - ALT-C
         This option allows you to add and/or update the compressed file
         comments.

     Supply Password for File - G
         This option allows you to supply a password when working with password
         encrypted files.  The password will be used when extracting, viewing,
         and modifying the currently selected compressed file. When a password
         has been supplied the compressed file display window will indicate that
         a password is in effect.

     Set Path/Directory option - P
         Version 4.9 of SHEZ now supports directory names in compressed files.
         Initially directory names are only supported in ZIP and LZH compressed
         files.  The PAK format will be coming out shortly.  The small data
         version of SHEZ will support compressed files that have seven or fewer
         unique directory names,  the large data version of SHEZ supports 40
         unique directory names.  If a file has been saved into a compressed
         file with a directory name the name will appear on the right side of
         the compressed file list.

         Normally when you update or extract files from a compressed file the
         directory information is ignored.  Using the 'P' option you can tell
         SHEZ that you want to save and/or use the directory information.  When
         you press the 'P' key a list of three options will appear on the
         screen.  The first option "Do not use Dir info", tells SHEZ to ignore
         directory information.  The second option "Use Dir Info" tells SHEZ to
         save the directory information when updating a compressed file, or to
         use the directory information when extracting files.  The third option,
         "Use Dir Info and Recurse", tells SHEZ to save directory information
         when updating a compressed file and to recurse down the directory tree
         when looking for files. The third option also tells SHEZ to use the
         directory information when extracting files.

         The following options are passed to the compression programs when
         directory information is to be used:

         USE DIR INFO                    USE DIR INFO AND RECURSE
         Pkzip -P                        Pkzip -Pr
         Pkunzip -d                      Pkunzip -d
         Lharc /x                        Lharc /x /r
         Lharc /x (when extracting)      Lharc /x (when extracting)

         Please consult the compression program's documentation for further
         information on what these options do.

     View file and archive comment records - ALT-V
         This option will display on the screen the contents of the archive file
         along with any comment records that have been placed into the archive
         file.

     Add/Update highlighted archive file comments - s
         This option will allow you to add and/or update comment records that
         are associated with the highlighted file in the archive.


                        SHEZ VERSION 5.5 USER MANUAL                   Page -19-



     Add/Update all archive file comments - SHIFT-S
         This option will allow you to add and/or update comment records that
         are associated with the each file in the archive.

     Convert SFX file - CTL-V
         This option will convert a self extracting compressed file (.COM or
         .EXE) back to a normal compressed file.  The normal compressed file
         will be placed on the same disk and in the same directory when the self
         extracting is located.  The self extracting file will remain intact.
         Please note that this option is only available when you are viewing the
         contents of a self extracting file. For a list the the self extracting
         file that can be read my SHEZ see the section titled SELF EXTRACTING
         FILE SUPPORT.

     Test COM,EXE, and OVL files in a compressed file for viruses - ALT-Z
         Using this option SHEZ interfaces with the virus scan program
         (SCAN.EXE) that is produced by McAfee Associates.  You must have
         version 39 or greater of this scan program in order for SHEZ to use it.
         When you press the ALT-Z key SHEZ will extract all .COM, .EXE, and .OV?
         files into its working directory and will execute the virus scan
         program to determine if any of the program files have been infected.
         (See the configuration section of this manual for more infomation on
         configuring SHEZ for this option).

|    Extract only newer files - ALT-N
|        The ALT-N command will only extract files contained in the compressed
|        file that are newer than the files that are contained in the extract
|        directory.

|    Alternate file viewers - CTL-ENTER
|        Pressing the CTL-ENTER command will allow you to view the currently
|        highlighted file using a user specified alternate file viewer.

|        (SEE THE SECTION "SETTING UP ALTERNATE FILE VIEWERS" FOR MORE INFO)

|    Show tagged file count - SHIFT-KEY
|        Pressing the SHIFT key will toggle the function key line to show you,
|        the number of files tagged, total compressed file size, and total
|        uncompressed file size.  If the compressed files you are working with
|        is a ZIP file it will also show you the size of the ZIP file that will
|        be created if you build a new ZIP files containing all of the tagged
|        files.  Please note this is only an estimate and does not take into
|        account file comment records and it assumes that the compression method
|        will be the same as is currently used.

     CREATING NEW COMPRESSED FILES

         SHEZ allows you to create new compressed files either from the
         directory display window, using the F7 key, or from the compressed file
         display window using the 'C' command.

         A window will appear asking you to enter the drive, directory, and name
         of the compressed file to be created.  YOU MUST ENTER A FILE EXTENSION
         OF .ZIP,.ARC,.LZH,.ZOO,or .PAK SO SHEZ KNOWS WHAT TYPE OF COMPRESSED
         FILE TO CREATE!!!!! Then you will asked if you want to add or move
         files into the new archive file.  You will also be asked to enter an
         optional password.  (If you enter a password all files added or moved
         to the archive file will be encrypted using the password. Do not forget
         the password you can not extract files from the file without the
         password and there is no way to determine the password if you forget
         it.)  Please note the password prompt will only appear if the
         compression program used to create the new file support encryption.

         A window will then be opened that will ask you to enter the filespecs
         of the files you wish to add or move into the new archive file. This
         filespec can include a disk, directory, and file specifications with
         wild cards.

         A third window will be opened allowing you to specify processing
         options.  The first option "Do you want to Tag files or Process as is"
         allows you to tell SHEZ that you want to Tag files for processing using
         the filespecs entered in the second window, or to simply pass the
         entered filespecs to the compression program exactly as entered.  The
         second option "Do you want to save directory information" allows you to
         tell SHEZ that you want directory information saved in the compressed
         file.  The third option "Do you want to recurse directories"  will tell
         the compression program to add/move all files in the directory you
         specified plus all directories that exist beneath it.

         If you indicated that you wanted to Tag files for processing a window
         will pop-up on the left side of the screen showing all files that
         matched the filespec you entered.  Tag the files you wish to add or
         move to the new compressed file by pressing the space bar.  When you
         are done tagging file press the return key and all tagged files will be
         added or moved into the new archive file.

         Please note that some of these options may not appear when you create a
         compressed file.  If the compression program you are using does not
         support saving directory information the directory information prompts
         will not appear.

     CONVERTING FILES

     Shez has the ability to convert one, or a group of tagged files, from one
     format to another.  First you must get the file or files you want to
     convert to appear in the filelist window on the left side of the screen.
     The easiest way to do this is to start up SHEZ and specify on the command
     line either *.*, *.ZIP, or *.ARC.  Then using the cursor keys highlight the
     file you want to convert and then press the ALT-V key to convert the file.
     You will then be asked what archive format you want to convert to.  Enter a
     Z, A, L, or O to convert to ZIP, ARC, LZH, or ZOO format.  You will also be
     asked if you want to delete the original file after the conversion has been
     successfully completed.  Respond Y or N. The new file will be placed on the
     same disk and directory that the original file was on.

     To convert numerous files start up SHEZ as above and use the cursor keys to
     highlight the files you want to convert, then press the space bar to TAG
     these files.  After all files have been tagged press CTRL-V to convert all
     TAGGED files.

     Release 4.4 of SHEZ will support version 1.0 of PKZIP.  To use the new
     features of version 1.0 of PKZIP you MUST run the configuration program,
     SHEZCFG, and specify that you are using version 1.0 of PKZIP.

     SHEZ will allow you to easily convert your old ZIP files into the new ZIP
     imploded format.  Simply tag the ZIP files you want to convert and specify
     that you want to convert them to ZIP files.  You will be asked if you want
     to delete the old compressed files after the conversion process.  SHEZ is
     smart enough not to delete the old compressed file if the have the same
     file extension as the new files.  I.E. when you convert a ZIP file to a ZIP
     file to take advantage of the new compression format SHEZ will not delete
     the converted ZIP files even if you told it to delete the old compressed
     files after converting them.

     SUPPORT FOR SELF EXTRACTING FILES

     Beginning with release 4.7 of SHEZ, SHEZ can now let you view the contents
     of self extracting files.  Files that have been created by the following
     compression programs are supported:

         PKARC, PKPAK, PKZIP version .92 thru 1.1, LHARC version 1.12 thru
         1.13c, PAK version 1.6 thru 2.01, ARC5 and ARC6.

     When you display the contents of a self extracting file SHEZ will attempt
     to identify which compression program was used to generate the self
     extracting file.  SHEZ will place the name of the compression program it
     has identified as the creator, on the heading line right next to the column
     titled NAME.

     In addition to viewing the contents of a self extracting file you may also
     extract individual files using SHEZ's extract command.  You may also
     convert the self extracting file back to a normal compressed file using the
     CTL-V command, or using the pull down menus.


                        SHEZ VERSION 5.5 USER MANUAL                   Page -22-



     You can not alter the contents of a self extracting file. I.E. add, update,
     freshen, move, etc.  The exception to this are self extracting files built
     by PKZIP.  These files you can treat like normal compressed files.  You can
     add, update, move, delete, freshen, etc.

     ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

     SHEZ will recognize the following environment variables if they are
     set:

     BIOS     This will force SHEZ to use BIOS for writing to the screen.
     MONO     This will force SHEZ to run in monochrome mode.
     SHEZEX   You can set this variable to the disk and path where you want SHEZ
              to write extracted file to. You can reset this default at any time
              by using the ALT-P command.
     SHEZWORK
              This variable may be used to specify a working directory for SHEZ
              to use instead of SHEZ buliding one of it's own.  This directory
              must be for the exclusive of SHEZ, and must exist prior to
              invoking SHEZ.  WHEN SHEZ TERMINATES ALL FILES IN THE DIRECTORY
              WILL BE DELETED, INCLUDING HIDDEN AND SYSTEM FILES, BUT THE
              DIRECTORY WILL NOT BE DELETED.  This option was added to allow
              more flexibility when running SHEZ on a LAN based system.

     SHEZCMT
              This variable may be set to specify a default comment file when
              adding/updating compressed file comment records to a group of
              tagged files.

     Examples:
         SET BIOS=Y
         SET MONO=Y
         SET SHEZEX=D:\WORK
         SET SHEZWORK=C:\SHEZXX\
         SET SHEZCMT=C:\COMMENT.DAT

              (This tells SHEZ to write extracted files onto the D disk in the
              \work directory.  You can change this at any time after executing
              SHEZ by using the ALT-P command.)

     The environment variables BIOS and MONO will override the BIOS and MONO
     parameters that were entered via the configuration program.

|    SETTING ALTERNATE FILE VIEWERS

|    Shez has the capability to activate user specified alternate file viewers
|    when the CTL-ENTER key is pressed.  The alternate file viewers are
|    specified via environment variables.  The "generic" alternate file viewer
|    is specified using the environment variable named SHEZEV, and "specific"
|    alternate file viewers are specified using environment variables named
|    SHEZEV.XXX where XXX is a file extension.

|    For example:

|    SET SHEZEV=C:\UTY\FVIEW $F /43
|    SET SHEZEV.GIF=VGIF $F /VGA
|    SET SHEZEV.PIC=VPIC $F /P

|    The first set command tells SHEZ the generic file viewer is located in the
|    C:\UTY directory and is called FVIEW.  The $F tells SHEZ where to place the
|    name of the file to view and the /43 is a parameter to pass to the FVIEW
|    program.

|    The second set command tells SHEZ, when using the alternate file viewer to
|    view files with a file extension of GIF, run the VGIF program, which is
|    located in a directory in the PATH, pass it a parameter of /VGA, and the $F
|    tells SHEZ where to place the name of the file to view.

|    The third set command tells SHEZ which alternate file viewer to use when
|    viewing files with an extension of .PIC.

|    Any number of specific file viewers may be specified.  When CTL-ENTER is
|    pressed, SHEZ first looks to see of a specific alternate file viewer has
|    been defined for viewing files with a file extension the same of the
|    highlighted file.  If one was defined it is activated and used.  If a
|    specific viewer has not been defined SHEZ then determines if a "generic"
|    alternate file viewer has been defined. If it has SHEZ uses the "generic"
|    viewer.  If no alternate viewer has been defined SHEZ than defaults to
|    using the normal viewer as defined when the SHEZCFG program was used to
|    configure SHEZ.

|    PLEASE NOTE: WHEN SHEZ ACTIVATES ANY ALTERNATE FILE VIEWER IT ALWAYS USES
|    ITS PAGING LOGIC TO SWAP MOST OF ITS CODE OUT OF MEMORY TO GIVE MORE ROOM
|    TO THE ALTERNATE FILE VIEWER.  THIS IS NOT A CONFIGURABLE OPTION SO BE
|    FORWARNED!!!!!!!!!!!!

|    THE SHEZFG PROGRAM

|    Release 5.5 of the SHEZCFG program now requires that you enter the full
|    path of the SHEZ.EXE program you wish to configure.  This has been done
|    since some users are running multiple copies of SHEZ configured
|    differently.

     Beginning with release 5.4 of SHEZ, the configuration program will now
     allow you to install the serial number you receive from CSD when you
     register your version of SHEZ.  Installing the serial number "unlocks" SHEZ
     and allows you to configure SHEZ to handle more files per directory and per
     compressed file.  The 5.4 version of the SHEZCFG program will also allow
     you to pass optional command line arguments to the editor that you tell
     SHEZ to invoke.

|    The SHEZCFG program directly modifies the SHEZ.EXE program. The
|    configuration program SHEZCFG and the SHEZ program now come as a matched
|    set.  YOU MUST USE THE CORRECT CONFIGURATION PROGRAM OR YOU WILL NOT BE
|    ABLE TO CUSTOMIZE SHEZ.

|    The configuration program will present you with an initial menu.  Enter one
|    of the highlighted letters that appears on the menu to set the
|    configuration parameters that fall under the indicated category. New items
|    that can be set during configuration are:

     1) Use the BIOS for screen writing.
     2) Indicate if you are using a Monochrome monitor.
     3) Set default ZIP compression factors.
     4) Enter a full Disk:\Directory name for all externally called programs.
        (I.E. PKZIP, PKUNZIP, LIST, etc.)
     5) Indicate if you want exploding windows or not.

     The configuration program will allow you to modify SHEZ'S default color
     setting, tell SHEZ the name of the archive programs, the name of extract
     program, customize the number of files per archive file SHEZ can handle,
     customize the number of files per directory SHEZ can handle, specify a work
     disk to use when viewing and executing file from an archive file, and other
     misc. parameters.

     When you start up SHEZ it records the current disk and directory. When you
     view or execute a file from an archive file SHEZ temporarily extracts the
     file onto the current disk and directory. This works fine as long as the
     current disk is your hard disk. However if your current disk is a floppy
     and there is not enough room on the floppy to build the extracted file than
     SHEZ will not let you view or execute the file.  To get around this use the
     configuration program and when the prompt:

     ENTER WORK DISK DRIVE LETTER TO USE WHEN VIEWING/RUNNING FILE->

     appears enter the disk drive letter of your hard disk or of your second
     floppy disk drive.  SHEZ will then use this disk to build the temporary
     extract files and will delete them when you are finished viewing or running
     the selected file from the archive.


                        SHEZ VERSION 5.5 USER MANUAL                   Page -26-



     When running under EGA or VGA you can tell SHEZ to go into 43 line mode for
     EGA'S, and 43 or 50 line mode for VGA's.  This is done via the
     configuration program.

|    You may tell SHEZ the files to search for when you use the wildcard
|    filespec of $.$.  The configuration program will ask you to enter the file
|    extension to search for when you enter a filespec of $.$.  The defaults are
|    .ARC,.ZIP,.LZH,.ZOO.  If you wish to modify these defaults enter the
|    extensions, along with the preceding dot, and separate each extension with
|    a comma.

     A new configuration option is present beginning with release 4.1 of SHEZ.
     The option will allow you indicate to the compression programs the disk
     drive to use to build temporary working copies of the compressed files.  If
     you are using PKZIP and/or PKPAK, PKARC, the disk drive letter will be
     passed to these programs by using the -b program option.  If you are using
     LHARC it will be passed to LHARC by using the /w switch.  Please refer to
     the compression program's documentation for further information.

     If you are using a monochrome monitor and you wish to alter the default
     screen attributes follow the procedure below or your attribute settings may
     be lost.

              1)  When the main configuration panel is displayed choose either
                  the Black and White color set, or the Monochrome set as a
                  starting point.

              2)  Then choose the Custom color set option to customize the
                  screen attributes as you see fit.

              3)  Choose any other configuration options after you are done
                  modifying the color set.

              4)  Save the configuration information.

     In version 4.4 of SHEZ you may now configure SHEZ to display the directory
     where extracted files will be placed.  This option may be set via the
     configuration program.  If this option is activated the extract location
     will be displayed on the top line of the screen when you are viewing the
     contents of an archive file.

     Beginning with version 4.9 of SHEZ you may now configure SHEZ to sort the
     contents of a compressed file when it is initially displayed on the screen.
     You may sort the compressed file list by Filename, File-extension, or by
     File-Date.

     Configuring for Virus Scanning


                        SHEZ VERSION 5.5 USER MANUAL                   Page -27-



     Under the program options, you will be asked if you wish to configure SHEZ
     to scan .COM and .EXE files contained in compressed files for viruses. If
     you respond Y, SHEZ will that ask you where the virus checking program can
     be found.  The program that SHEZ supports is SCAN.EXE version 39 or
     greater, produced by McAfee Associates.  When prompted enter the complete
     DISK:\DIRECTORY\FILENAME.EXT of where the SCAN.EXE is located.  It is
     advised that you please the SCAN program on a write protected floppy disk
     to prevent it from being infected.  PLEASE NOTE: SHEZ WILL NOT SEARCH YOUR
     PATH FOR THE SCAN PROGRAM.  IF YOU DO NOT TELL IT EXACTLY WHERE TO FIND IT
     SHEZ WILL BE UNABLE TO EXECUTE THE PROGRAM.

     As an added precaution the SHEZCFG program can now check the SHEZ program
     to see if it has been illegally altered.  This function will only work with
     version 4.91 and greater of the SHEZCFG program, and version 4.91 and
     greater of the SHEZ program. (Small or Large data version).  To use this
     function startup the SHEZCFG program and pick the item on the menu titled
     "Integrity check".  The SHEZCFG program will proceed to verify that the
     SHEZ program has not been altered.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS CHECK MAY BE
     PERFORMED EVEN AFTER YOU HAVE RECONFIGURED SHEZ.  The verification
     procedure uses to 16 bit CRC values to check the integrity.  If the
     calculated CRC's do not match the values stored in SHEZ a message will
     appear indicating that the integrity of SHEZ as been compromised.

                          CLONING THE CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
     Beginning with release 3.7 of SHEZ there is an option that allows you to
     write out a configuration file (SHEZ.CFG) that will be used by the
     configuration program, SHEZCFG, to copy your configuration information from
     your current version of SHEZ to the next version of SHEZ. To perform the
     cloning operation do the following steps:

     1.  Start up the SHEZ program with no parameters.
     2.  When the file list window appears press the ALT-W keys. This will write
         out the current SHEZ configuration information into a file named
         SHEZ.CFG onto the current disk and directory.
     3.  Unpack all files from the new version of SHEZ onto the disk and
         directory where the SHEZ.CFG file exists.
|    4.  Rename the old SHEZ.EXE program file to SHEZ.OLD
|    5.  Run the SHEZCFG program.
     6.  You will be asked the name of the program to modify, the default is
         SHEZ.EXE. Press the enter key and the following message should appear
         at the top of the screen:
         CONFIGURATION INFORMATION FROM FILE SHEZ.CFG BEING USED
     7.  Press the enter key to display the configuration menu.
     8.  Select the Save configuration information option, and your new copy of
         SHEZ will be updated with your old configuration information.
     9.  Delete the SHEZ.CFG file.

     *****************************************************************
     Please note when you clone the configuration options the serial number that
     was previously installed is lost!!  After cloning the configuration option
     you must reinstall your serial number if one was previously installed!!!

                                COMPATIBILITY ISSUES

     SHEZ achieves fast screen updates buy writing directly to video buffer
     memory.  If your machine is not 100% compatible you can force SHEZ to use
     BIOS routines to update the screen.  This is accomplished by setting an
     environment variable BIOS equal to Y. I.E. SET BIOS=Y. Do this before
     executing SHEZ.

     For monochrome monitors a similar method is employed set the environment
     variable MONO equal to Y.  I.E.  SET MONO=Y.

     Some clone machines have a bug in the builtin BIOS routines that will cause
     SHEZ to hang if you have exploding windows turned on.  If you experience a
     machine lock up, try reconfiguring SHEZ and turn the exploding windows off.



     Please let me know how you like SHEZ.

                 records.

                 Increased the number of unique directory name the large data
                 version can handle, from 20 to 40.

         v5.2    01/05/90 When specifying an extract directory, via ALT-P, that
