STYPE.COM -- A Smooth-Scrolling EGA DOS "MORE" Replacement
------------------------------------------------------------------------

STYPE.COM is a variable speed smooth scrolling substitute for TYPE or
MORE that works ONLY with an IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter.  This
program and documentation comes by way of the PC SIG on Compuserve.

STYPE 1.1     Smooth-Scrolling EGA DOS "MORE" Replacement      85 Jan 13

**************  REQUIRES IBM ENHANCED GRAPHICS ADAPTER *****************

Purpose:       Smooth scrolling type file to screen.

Usage:         STYPE FILENAME      or,
               STYPE               when using STDIN


Description:  STYPE types a file to the screen controlled by an IBM
Enhanced Graphics Adapter, using variable speed smooth scroll.  If no
file name is supplied, it will read from the standard input STDIN (eg:
STYPE < FILENAME, or PROGRAM | STYPE), and thus can act as a "MORE" type
filter.  The EGA must be in 25 line character mode.  The EGA need not be
the current console device; it will behave the same either way.  It can
be emulating either the IBM Monochrome Display and Printer Adapter or
the IBM Color/Graphics Adapter.

The scroll speed may vary from stopped (0) to one line per vertical
retrace (speed 14 in mono mode, or 8 in color mode), by units of 1/2.
The speed represents the number of vertical pels scrolled per vertical
retrace.  (A speed of 1/2 means it scrolls 1 pel every 2 retraces, or
speed 1 1/2 means it scrolls alternately 1 and 2 pels).  The following
commands may be typed while stype is showing the file:

     +         increment speed by 1/2 unit (up to max speed)
     -         decrement speed by 1/2 unit (down to zero, or stopped)
     0-9       set speed to number given
     space     set speed to zero (ie: stop immediately)

Any other key will abort stype and return to DOS.

Remember that "0" or space will stop the listing and set the speed at
zero - a "+" or non-zero digit will restart it.


Problems:  It will not support graphic modes, nor the new character
modes (eg:  43 lines, or a non-standard character height.

It cannot detect what mode the EGA is in unless it is the current CON:
device, so stange errors may result if the EGA is not your console and
it is not a standard (mono or color) device (modes 2, 3, or 7).
