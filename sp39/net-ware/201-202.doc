Upgrading from FrontDoor 2.01 to FrontDoor 2.02
Copyright 1991 Advanced Engineering sarl. All rights reserved
-------------------------------------------------------------

There are some differences between 2.01 and 2.02 that you must be
aware of and allow for when upgrading to 2.02. If you are
upgrading from 1.99c directly to 2.02, you should read the
199c-201.doc file included in this archive, before you read this
file.

	"ALL" has been replaced by "*" in FM's Carbon Copy function.

	Changed the Carbon Copy function to comply with the new format
	of mail routing macros. FM now treats "MYNET" as "z:n/*", where
	z=<MyCurrentZone> and n=<MyCurrentNet>.

	FD will now attempt to use the type 2.2 packet header information
	from a calling system if the session is an FTS-1 session and the
	packet header indicates 2.2 format. This does NOT mean I endorse
    the FSC-45 proposal by any stretch of the imagination. It is only
    for the FrontDoor users' convenience.

IMPORTANT!
----------
If all else fails when attempting to upgrade from 2.01 to 2.02, I
would suggest starting off in a new fresh directory with the 2.02
files and take it from there. I realize this may sound very un-
professional, but I'm trying to give a realistic worst-case
suggestion.
