Upgrading from FrontDoor 1.99c to FrontDoor 2.01
Copyright 1991 Advanced Engineering sarl. All rights reserved
-------------------------------------------------------------

There are several differences between 1.99c and 2.01 that you must be
aware of and allow for when upgrading to 2.01.


FILES, GENERAL
--------------
SETUP.EXE has been renamed to FDSETUP.EXE. Make sure you remove your
old copy of FrontDoor's SETUP.EXE.

FD.SYS has been renamed to SETUP.FD. Some programs, including TosScan
1.00, still require that FD.SYS be present. For this purpose, it is
necessary to copy SETUP.FD to FD.SYS whenever you have made any changes
in FDSETUP. Later versions of these programs will most likely support
SETUP.FD instead of FD.SYS. TosScan 1.10 will.

FDNODIAL.SYS must be renamed to NODIAL.FD.

PASSWORD.SYS must be renamed to PASSWORD.FD.

REQUEST.SYS must be renamed to REQUEST.FD

FOLDER.SYS must be renamed to FOLDER.FD

EVENT.SYS must be renamed to EVENT.FD

TERMINAL.SYS requires that you run the supplied PHONECVT utility. The
utility will automatically rename TERMINAL.SYS to TERMPHON.FD when it
has completed its task.


ROUTE.FD
--------
This is the route file for both 1.99c and 2.01. What has changed in
2.01 is:

	The ALL macro is no longer supported. It has been replaced by the
	* (asterisk) character.

	The MYNET macro can no longer be used in conjunction with a node
	number. Eg. MYNET/1 is NOT a valid construct anymore. MYNET now
	expands to <yourzone>:<yournet>/*, eg. "2:270/*".

	The route file is evaluated from top to bottom, with commands
	listed later override the effect those listed earlier.

Please refer to the "Mail routing" section when in doubt.


FDNODE.CTL
----------
The MODEM .. END section in FDNODE.CTL has been moved to a manager in
FDSETUP.


IMPORTANT!
----------
If all else fails when attempting to upgrade from 1.99c to 2.01, I
would suggest starting off in a new fresh directory with the 2.01
files and take it from there. I realize this may sound very un-
professional, but I'm trying to give a realistic worst-case
suggestion.
