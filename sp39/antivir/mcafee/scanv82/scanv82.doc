SYNOPSIS

     VIRUSCAN (SCAN) is a virus detection and identification
program for the IBM PC and compatible computers.  VIRUSCAN will
search a PC for known computer viruses in memory, the boot sector,
the partition table, and the files of a PC and its disks.  VIRUSCAN
will also detect the presence of unknown viruses.
     SCAN works by searching the system for instruction sequences
or patterns that are unique to each computer virus, and then
reporting their presence if found.  This method works for viruses
that VIRUSCAN recognizes.  SCAN can detect unknown viruses in
files and boot sector by appending validation (CRC) codes to .COM
and .EXE files and then checking the files against their codes for
changes, warning that an infection may have occurred if the file
has been modified in any way, and by checking boot sectors for
generic routines that a boot sector virus must have.  SCAN can
check for new viruses from a user-supplied list of virus search
strings.
     VIRUSCAN runs on any PC with 256Kb and DOS version 2.00 or
greater.


AUTHENTICITY

     VIRUSCAN runs a self-test when executed.  If SCAN has been
modified in any way, a warning will be displayed.  The program will
still continue to check for viruses, though.  If SCAN reports that it
has been damaged, it is recommended that a clean copy be obtained.
     VIRUSCAN versions 46 and above are packaged with the VALIDATE
program to ensure the integrity of the SCAN.EXE file.  The
VALIDATE.DOC  instructions tell how to use the VALIDATE program.
The VALIDATE program distributed with VIRUSCAN may be used to check
all further versions of SCAN.

     The validation results for Version 7.8V82 should be:

              FILE NAME: SCAN.EXE
                   SIZE: 90,163
                   DATE: 09-12-1991
    FILE AUTHENTICATION
         Check Method 1: CD7E
         Check Method 2: 1E76

If your copy of SCAN.EXE differs, it may have been modified.
Always obtain your copy of VIRUSCAN from a known source.  The
latest version of VIRUSCAN and validation data for SCAN.EXE can be
obtained off of McAfee Associates' bulletin board system at (408)
988-4004 or from the Computer Virus Help Forum on CompuServe.

     Beginning with Version 72, all McAfee Associates programs for
download are archived with PKWare's PKZIP Authentic File Verification.
If you do not see the "-AV" message after every file is unzipped and
receive the message "Authentic Files Verified! # NWN405  Zip Source:
McAFEE ASSOCIATES" when you unzip the files then do not run them.  If
your version of PKUNZIP does not have verification ability, then this
message may not be displayed.  Please contact McAfee Associates if
your .ZIP file has been tampered with.

WHAT'S NEW
    
     We have skipped version 81 of SCAN due to a bogus version of
SCAN81 that appeared in Toronto in mid August.  The bogus version
turned out to be harmless.
     Two new options were added to the VIRUSCAN program, /CHKHI
and /MAINT.  When VIRUSCAN is run with the /CHKHI option it will
check memory from 0Kb to 1088Kb.  When VIRUSCAN is run with the
/MAINT option, it will check MS-DOS 4.0+ installed hard disks that
have been damaged by a boot sector virus and are otherwise unreadable.
     49 new viruses were added.  Viruses that were reported at
multiple sites include:  V-748 reported in California and Texas,
the Dec 28 from Zaragoza University in Spain, Miky from Bolivia
and Florida, Mosquito, the Sunday-2 from Canada, R-11, and Tokyo.
Other viruses added in this release include the #1, 789, 1014, 1661,
1840, 2480, BackTime, Boys, Burghofer, CADKill, CD, Cinderella,
Damage, Demon, Dropper, Europe-'92, ETC, Gotcha, Hero, Hitchcock,
Jerk, Klaeren, M128, Mini-45, Manta, Mule, NewCom, Nobock, Possessed,
QP3, R10, R11, Scud, Spanish, Spanz, Topo, Tuesday, Twin-351, V125,
V-483, V812, and Xabaras viruses.

     For a listing of the viruses that were added, please refer to
the enclosed VIRLIST.TXT file for a short description.  For a more
complete description, please refer to Patricia Hoffman's VSUM listing.

    In addition to the enhancements to SCAN, we are now running the
Compuserve Computer Virus Forum.  Updates to SCAN, virus information, 
and product support may be obtained by typing GO VIRUSFORUM after
logging on to Compuserve.  A free introductory membership to Compuserve
is also available to users of SCAN (whether or not you choose to register
SCAN).  Please read the enclosed Compuserve document for details.

OVERVIEW

     VIRUSCAN scans diskettes or entire systems for pre-existing
computer virus infections.  It will identify the virus infecting
the system, and tell what area of the system (memory, boot sector,
file) the virus occupies.  An infected file can be removed with
the overwrite-and-delete option, /D which will erase the file.
The CLEAN-UP program is also available to automatically disinfect
the system and repair damaged areas whenever possible.
     VIRUSCAN Version 82 identifies all 297 known computer viruses
along with their variants.  Some viruses have been modified so that
more than one "strain" exists.  Counting such modifications, there
are 893 virus variants.  The twenty most common viruses which
account for over 98% of all reported PC infections are also
identified by SCAN.  The accompanying VIRLIST.TXT file lists
describes all new, public domain, and extinct computer viruses
identified by SCAN.  The number of variants of each virus is listed
in parentheses after the virus name.
      All known computer viruses infect one or more of the
following areas:  the hard or fixed disk partition table (also
known as the master boot record); the DOS boot sector of hard disks
and floppy disks; or one or more executable files within the
system.  Executable files include operating system files, .COM
files, .EXE files, overlay files, or any other files loaded into
memory and executed.  A virus that infects more than one area, such
as a boot sector and an executable file is called a multipartite
virus.
     VIRUSCAN identifies every area or file that is infected, and
indicates both the name of the virus and CLEAN-UP I.D. code used
to remove it.  SCAN will check the entire system, an individual
diskette, subdirectory, or individual files for existing viruses.
     VIRUSCAN can also check files for unknown viruses with the Add
Validation and Check Validation options.  This is done by computing
a code for a file, appending it to the file, and then validating
the file against that code.  If the file has been modified, the
check will no longer match, indicating that viral infection may
have occurred.  SCAN uses two independently generated CRC (Cyclic
Redundancy Check) checks that are added to the end of program files
to do this.  Files which are self-checking should not be validated
since this will "set off" the program's self-check.  Files which
are self-modifying may have different values for the same program
depending upon the modifications.  VIRUSCAN adds validation codes
to .COM and .EXE files only.  The validation codes for the
partition table, boot sector, and system files, are kept in a
hidden file called SCANVAL.VAL in the root directory.  To detect
boot sector viruses, SCAN checks the boot sector for signs of
viral code.  If suspicious code is found, SCAN will report that it
has found a Suspcious Boot Sector Virus.
     VIRUSCAN can also be updated to search for new viruses via
an External Virus Data File option, which allows the user to
provide the VIRUSCAN program with new search strings for viruses.
     VIRUSCAN can display messages in either English or French.
     VIRUSCAN works on stand-alone and networked PC's, but not on
a file server.  For networks, the NETSCAN server drive scanning
program must be used.

OPERATION

IMPORTANT NOTE:  WRITE PROTECT YOUR FLOPPY DISK BEFORE SCANNING
YOUR SYSTEM TO PREVENT INFECTION OF THE VIRUSCAN PROGRAM.

     VIRUSCAN will check each area or file on the designated
drive(s) that could be host to a virus.  If a virus is found, a
message is displayed telling the name of the infected file or
system area and the name of the identified virus.  SCAN will
examine files for viruses based on their extensions.  The default
file extensions supported by SCAN are .APP, .BIN, .COM, .EXE, .OV?,
.PGM, .PIF, .PRG, .SWP, .SYS, and .XTP.  Additional extensions can
be added to SCAN or all files on disk can be selected for scanning.

     To run VIRUSCAN type:

SCAN d1: ... d10: /A /AV /CHKHI /CV /D /E .xxx .yyy .zzz
                  /EXT d:filename /FR /MAINT /MANY /NLZ /NOBREAK
                  /NOMEM /NOPAUSE /REPORT d:filename /RV /SUB

Options are:
                  \ - Scan root directory and boot area only
                 /A - Scan all files, including data, for viruses
                /AV - Add validation codes to specified files
             /CHKHI - Check memory from 0Kb to 1088Kb
                /CV - Check validation codes for files
                 /D - Overwrite and delete infected file
  /E .xxx .yyy .zzz - Scan overlay extensions .xxx .yyy .zzz
    /EXT d:filename - Scan using external virus information file
                /FR - Display messages in French
                 /M - Scan memory for all viruses
                      (see below for specifics)
             /MAINT - Scan MS-DOS 4.0+ boot sector damaged disk
              /MANY - Scan multiple floppies
               /NLZ - Skip internal scan of LZEXE compressed files
           /NOBREAK - Disable Ctrl-C / Ctrl-Brk during scanning
             /NOMEM - Skip memory checking
           /NOPAUSE - Disable screen pause when scanning
 /REPORT d:filename - Create report of infected files
                /RV - Remove validation codes from specified files
               /SUB - Scan subdirectories

           (d1: ... d10: indicate drives to be scanned)

     The /A option will cause SCAN to check all files on the
referenced drive.  This should only be used if a file-infecting
virus has already been detected.  Otherwise the /A option should
only be used when checking a new program.  The /A option will add
a substantial time to scanning.  This option takes priority over
the /E option.
     The /AV option allows the user to add validation codes to the
files being scanned.  If a full drive is specified, SCAN will
create validation data for the partition table, boot sector, and
system files of the disk as well.  Validation adds ten (10) bytes
to files; the validation data for the partition table, boot sector,
and system files is stored separately in a hidden file in the root
directory of the scanned drive.
VIRUSCAN Version 7.8V82                                Page 6


     The /CHKHI option checks the memory above 640Kb that can be
used on AT (286) and 386 systems for computer viruses.  This
includes the 384Kb Upper Memory Area from 640Kb to 1024Kb, and
the 64Kb High Memory Area from 1024Kb to 1088Kb.  On XT systems with
extended memory cards installed, this will cause the first 64K of
RAM to be scanned again.  This option can not be used with the
/NOMEM option.

     The /CV option checks the validation codes inserted by the /AV
option.  If the file has been changed, SCAN will report that the
file has been modified, and that viral infection may have occurred.
Using the /CV option adds about 25% more time to scanning.

NOTE:  Some older Hewlett Packard and Zenith PC's modify the boot
sector or partition table each time the system is booted.  This
will cause SCAN to continually notify the user of boot sector or
partition table modifications if the /CV switch is selected.  Check
your system's manual to determine if your system contains
self-modifying boot code.

     The /D option tells VIRUSCAN to prompt the user to overwrite
and delete an infected file when one is found.  If the user selects
"Y" the infected file will be overwritten with hex code C3 [the
Return-to-DOS instruction] and then deleted.  A file erased by the
/D option can not be recovered.  If the McAfee Associates' CLEAN-
UP program is available, it is recommended that CLEAN be used to
remove the virus instead of SCAN, since in most cases it will
recover the infected file.  Boot sector and partition table
infectors can not be removed by the /D option and require the
CLEAN-UP virus disinfection program.
     The /E option allows the user to specify an extension or set
of extensions to scan.  Extensions should include the period
character "." and be separated by a space after the /E and between
each other.  Up to three extensions may be added with the /E.  For
more extensions, use the /A option.
     The /EXT option allows VIRUSCAN to search for viruses from a
text file containing user-defined search strings in addition to the
viruses that already SCAN checks for.  The syntax for using the
external virus data file is /EXT d:filename, where d: is the drive
name and filename is the name of the external virus data file.  For
instructions on how to create an external virus data file, refer
to Appendix A.

NOTE:  The /EXT option is intended for users to add strings for
       detection of computer viruses on an interim or emergency
       basis.  When used with the /D option, it will delete
       infected files. This option is not recommended for general
       use and should be used with caution.

     The /FR option tells VIRUSCAN to output all messages in French
instead of English.
     The /M option tells VIRUSCAN to check system memory for all
known computer viruses that can inhabit memory.  SCAN by default
only checks memory for critical and "stealth" viruses, which are
viruses which can cause catastrophic damage or spread the infection
during the scanning process.  SCAN will check memory for the
following viruses in any case:
VIRUSCAN Version 7.8V82                                Page 7

     1024           1253          1554          1963
     1971           2100          2560          337
     3445-Stealth   4096          512           Anthrax
     Anti-Tel       Brain         Dark Avenger  Darth Vader
     Disk Killer    Doom2         EDV           Empire
     Fish6          Form          Greemlin      Invader
     Joshi          Microbes      Mirror        Murphy
     Nomenclature   Phantom       Plastique     Polish-2
     P1R (Phoenix)  Sentinel      Stoned        Tequila
     Taiwan-3       Whale         Zero-Hunt


If one of these viruses is found in memory, SCAN will stop and
advise the user to power down, and reboot the system from a
virus-free system disk.  Using the /M option with another
anti-viral software package may result in false alarms if the other
package does not remove its virus search strings from memory.  The
/M option will add 6 to 20 seconds to the scanning time.
     The /MAINT option is used to scan hard disks partitioned with
DOS 4.0 or above that have been damaged by a boot sector or partition
table infecting virus.  Attempts to access disks damaged in such a
manner result in an "invalid media" message being displayed.  The
/MAINT option will only scan the partition table and boot sector,
not the files.  Only use this option if you are unable to normally
read the hard drive.
     The /MANY option is used to scan multiple diskettes placed in
a given drive.  If the user has more than one floppy disk to
check for viruses, the /MANY option will allows the user to check
them without having to run SCAN multiple times.  If a system has
been disinfected, the /MANY and /NOMEM options can be used to speed
up scanning of disks.
     The /NLZ option tells VIRUSCAN not to look inside files
compressed with the LZEXE file compression program.  SCAN will
still check the programs for external infections.
     The /NOBREAK option disables Control-C or Control-Break from
stopping VIRUSCAN while running. 
     The /NOMEM option is used to turn off all memory checking for
viruses.  It should only be used when a system is known to be free
of viruses.  The /NOMEM option can not be used with the /CHKHI or /M
options.
     The /NOPAUSE option disables the "More..." prompt that appears
when SCAN fills up a screen with data.  This allows VIRUSCAN to run
on a machine with multiple infections without requiring operator
intervention when the screen fills up with messages from the SCAN
program.
     The /REPORT option is used to generate a listing of infected
files.  The resulting list is saved to disk as an ASCII text file.
To use the report option, specify /REPORT on the command line,
followed by the device and filename [See EXAMPLES below for
samples].
     The /RV option is used to remove validation codes from a file
or files.  It can be used to remove the validation code from a
diskette, subdirectory, or file(s).  Using /RV on a disk will
remove the partition table, boot sector, and system file
validation.  This option can not be used with the /AV option.
     The /SUB option allows SCAN to scan subdirectories under a
a subdirectory when scanned.  Previously, SCAN would only
recursively check subdirectories if a logical device (e.g., C:)
was scanned.

EXIT CODES

     VIRUSCAN will set the DOS ERRORLEVEL upon program termination
to:

     ERRORLEVEL | DESCRIPTION
     -----------+--------------------------
         0      | No viruses found
         1      | One or more viruses found
         2      | Abnormal termination (program error)

If a user stops the scanning process, SCAN will set the ERRORLEVEL
to 0 or 1 depending on whether or not a virus was discovered prior
to termination of the SCAN.  The /NOBREAK option can be used to
prevent scanning from being stopped.


VIRUS REMOVAL

     What do you do if a virus is found?  You can contact McAfee
Associates for help with removing viruses by BBS, FAX, telephone,
or Internet.  There is no charge for support calls to McAfee
Associates.
     The CLEAN-UP universal virus disinfection program is available
and will disinfect the majority of reported computer viruses.  It
is updated with each release of the SCAN program to remove new
viruses.  The CLEAN-UP program can be downloaded from McAfee
Associates BBS, the SIMTEL20 archives on the InterNet, the McAfee
Associates'-sponsored Computer Virus Help Forum on CompuServe, or
from the agents listed in the enclosed text file.
     It is strongly recommended that you get experienced help in
dealing with viruses, especially critical viruses that can damage
or destroy data [for a listing of critical viruses, see the /M
option under OPTIONS, above] and partition table or boot sector
infecting viruses, as improper removal of these viruses could
result in the loss of all data and use of the disk(s).
     For qualified assistance in removing a virus, please contact
McAfee Associates directly or check the enclosed AGENTS.TXT file

APPENDIX A:  Creating a Virus String File with the /EXT Option

     The External Virus Data file should be created with an editor
or a word processor and saved as an ASCII text file.  Be sure each
line ends with a CR/LF pair.

NOTE:  The /EXT option is intended for emergency and research use
only.  It is an temporary method for identifying new viruses prior
to the subsequent release of SCAN.  A sound understanding of
viruses and string-search techniques is advised as a prerequisite
for using this option.

     The virus string file uses the following format:

#Comment about Virus_1
"aabbccddeeff..." Virus_1_Name
#Comment about Virus_2
"gghhiijjkkll..." Virus_2_Name
     .
     .
"uuvvwwxxyyzz..." Virus_n_Name


Where aa, bb, cc, etc. are the hexadecimal bytes that you wish to
scan for.  Each line in the file represents one virus.  The Virus
Name for each virus is mandatory, and may be up to 25 characters
in length.  The double quotes (") are required at the beginning and
end of each hexadecimal string.
     SCAN will use the string file to search memory, the Partition
Table, Boot Sector, System files, all .COM and .EXE files, and
Overlay files with the extension .BIN, .OV?, .PGM, .PIF, .PRG, .SYS
and .XTP.

     Virus strings may contain wild cards.  The two wildcard
options are:

FIXED POSITION WILDCARD
     The question mark "?" may be used to represent a wildcard in
a fixed position within the string.  For example, the string:

               "E9 7C 00 10 ? 37 CB"

would match "E9 7C 00 10 27 37 CB", "E9 7C 00 10 9C 37 CB", or any
other similar string, no matter what byte was in the fifth place.

RANGE WILDCARD
     The asterisk "*", followed by range number in parentheses "("
and ")" is used to represent a variable number of adjoining random
bytes.  For example, the string:

               "E9 7C *(4) 37 CB"

would match "E9 7C 00 37 CB", "E9 7C 00 11 37 CB", and
"E9 7C 00 11 22 37 CB".  The string "E9 7C 00 11 22 33 44 37 CB"
would not match since the distance between 7C and 37 is greater
than four bytes.  You may specify a range of up to 99 bytes.
VIRUSCAN Version 7.8V82                                Page 12


Up to 10 different wildcards of either kind may be used in one
virus string.

COMMENTS
     A pound sign "#" at the begining of a line will denote that
it is a comment.  Use this for adding notes to the external virus
data file.  For example:

               #New .COM virus found in file FRITZ.EXE from
               #Schneiderland on 01-22-91
               "53 48 45 45 50" Fritz-1 [F-1]

Could be used to store a description of the virus, name of the
original infected file, where and when it was received, and so
forth.


APPENDIX B:  Miscellaneous Application Notes


CHECKING MEMORY FOR VIRUS ONLY

     VIRUSCAN can perform a quick check of for viruses in memory only.
In this mode, the SCAN program will not check the disk for computer
viruses.  This option is useful for network administrators who need
to check workstations for viruses before allowing them to log on to a
LAN but can not run the VSHIELD program due to memory constraints.
The command to enter is:

     SCAN NUL /M /CHKHI

By designating NUL as the drive to be scanned, the SCAN program will
check system memory for viruses (up to 1088Kb if the /CHKHI option
is used) and then return to DOS without scanning any disks.  SCAN
will set the DOS ERRORLEVEL as it normally does.
                                                

VIRUSCAN VALIDATION CODES

     If you have installed any new software or programson your system,
and are running VIRUSCAN or VSHIELD with the check validation codes
/CV option, you will need to reinstall validation codes to the new
files with the add validation codes /AV option of VIRUSCAN.
Additionally, the SCANVAL.VAL hidden file containing validation codes
for the partition table, boot sector, COMMAND.COM, and system files
may have to be replaced. The MS-DOS 5.00 SETVER.EXE file contains
self-modifying code and can not have a validation code added to it.
The quickest way to update the validation codes is to remove all
validation codes from the hard disk and then add them back on by
running VIRUSCAN with the /RV and then the /AV options, and then
removing the validation code from SETVER.EXE by typing "
SCAN C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE /RV" and pressing enter.
VIRUSCAN Version 7.8V82                                Page 13


NOTE: This applies to any new version of DOS, as well as any
programs which you install on your system.


DOS 5 AND REFORMATTING INFECTING FLOPPIES

     If you are reformatting infecting floppy disks under DOS 5.0,
be sure to add the /U switch to the FORMAT command.  This tells DOS
to do an Unconditional format of the disk, and not to save the original
(infected) boot sector of the disk.  This should be done to prevent the
virus from reappearing by unformatting the disk.
