SYNOPSIS

     CLEAN-UP (CLEAN) is a virus disinfection program for IBM PC
and compatible computers.  CLEAN-UP will search though the
partition table, boot sector, or files of a PC and remove a virus
specified by the user. In most instances CLEAN-UP is able to repair
the infected area of the system and restore it to normal usage. 
CLEAN-UP works on all viruses identified by the current version of
the VIRUSCAN (SCAN) program.
     CLEAN-UP runs on any PC with 256Kb and DOS 2.00 or above.


AUTHENTICITY

     CLEAN-UP runs a self-test when executed.  If CLEAN has been
modified in any way, a warning will be displayed.  The program will
still continue to remove viruses, though.  If CLEAN reports that
it has been damaged, is recommended that a new, clean copy be
obtained.
     CLEAN-UP is packaged with the VALIDATE program to ensure the 
integrity of the CLEAN.EXE file.  The VALIDATE.DOC instructions
tell how to use the VALIDATE program.  The VALIDATE program
distributed with CLEAN-UP may be used to check all further versions
of CLEAN.

     The validation results for Version 82 should be:

              FILE NAME: CLEAN.EXE
                   SIZE: 129,001
                   DATE: 09-14-1991
    FILE AUTHENTICATION
         Check Method 1: 1213
         Check Method 2: 1E9E

If your copy of CLEAN.EXE differs, it may have been modified. 
Always obtain your copy of CLEAN-UP from a known source.  The
latest version of CLEAN-UP and validation data for SCAN.EXE can be
obtained off of McAfee Associates' bulletin board system at (408)
988-4004 or from our Computer Virus Help Forum on CompuServe.
     Beginning with Version 72, all McAfee Associates programs for
download are archived with PKWare's PKZIP Authentic File
Verification.  If you do not see the "-AV" message after every file
is unzipped and receive the message "Authentic Files Verified!  
# NWN405  Zip Source: McAFEE ASSOCIATES" when you unzip the files
then do not run them.  If your version of PKUNZIP does not have
verification ability, then this message may not be displayed.
Please contact McAfee Associates if your .ZIP file has been
tampered with.

WHAT'S NEW

     Version 82 of CLEAN-UP adds a new option to recover disks
formatted under DOS 4.0 and above that have been damaged, and made
otherwise unreadable, by a boot sector or partition table virus.  When the
/MAINT option is run, CLEAN-UP will in most cases fix the boot area or
partition table of such damaged disks.
     Disinfectors have been added for the 748 [748], 2100 [2100],
Anti-Telefonica [A-Vir], Curse [Curse], December 28 [D28],
Miky [Miky], Mosquito [Mosq], R11 [R11], Sunday-2 [Su2], and
Tokyo [Tok] viruses.
     Please refer to the enclosed VIRLIST.TXT file for a short
description of the new viruses.  For a more complete description,
please refer to Patricia Hoffman's VSUM listing.


OVERVIEW

     CLEAN-UP searches the system looking for the virus you wish
to remove.  When an infected file is found, CLEAN-UP isolates and
removes the virus, and in most cases, repairs the infected file and
restores it to normal operation.  If the file is infected with a
less common virus, CLEAN-UP will then display a warning message and
prompt the user, asking whether to overwrite and delete the
infected file.  Files erased in such a manner are non-recoverable.
    Verify the suspect virus infection with the VIRUSCAN program
before running CLEAN-UP.  VIRUSCAN will locate and identify the
virus and provide the I.D. code needed to remove it.  The I.D. is
displayed inside the square brackets, "[" and "]."  For example,
the I.D. code for the Jerusalem virus is displayed as
"[Jeru]".  This I.D. must be used with CLEAN-UP to remove the
virus.  The square brackets "[" and "]" MUST be included.

     The common viruses that CLEAN-UP is able to remove
successfully and repair and restore the damaged programs are:

*Denotes virus with more than one strain
+Denotes virus which attaches to overlays

AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT .EXE FILES:  Some viruses which infect .EXE
files can not be removed successfully in all cases.  This usually
occurs when the .EXE file loads internal overlays.  Instead of
attaching to the end of the .EXE file, the virus may attach to the
beginning of the overlay area, and program instructions are
overwritten.  CLEAN-UP will truncate files infected in this manner.
If a file no longer runs after being cleaned, replace it from the
manufacturer's original disk.

AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE STONED VIRUS:  Removing the Stoned
virus can cause loss of the partition table on systems with
non-standard formatted hard disks.  As a precaution, backup all
critical data before running CLEAN-UP.  Loss of the partition table
can result in the LOSS OF ALL DATA ON THE DISK.


OPERATION:

IMPORTANT NOTE:  POWER DOWN YOUR SYSTEM AND BOOT FROM A CLEAN
SYSTEM DISK BEFORE BEGINNING.  RUN THE CLEAN-UP PROGRAM FROM A
WRITE-PROTECTED DISK TO PREVENT INFECTION OF THE PROGRAM.

     Power down the infected system and boot from a clean,
write-protected system diskette.  This step will insure that the
virus is not in control of the computer and will prevent
reinfection.  After cleaning, power down the system again, reboot
from the system disk, and run the VIRUSCAN program to make sure the
system has been succesfully disinfected.  After cleaning the hard
disk, run the VIRUSCAN program on any floppies that may have been
inserted into the infected system to determine if they have been
infected.
     CLEAN-UP will display the name of the infected file, the virus
found in it, and report a "successful" disinfection when the virus
is removed.  If a file has been infected multiple times by a virus
(possible if the virus does not check to see if it has already
attached to a file) than CLEAN-UP will report that the virus has
been removed successfully for each infection.

     To run CLEAN-UP type:

CLEAN d1: ... d10: [virus ID]  /A /CHKHI /E .xxx /FR /MAINT /MANY
                   /M /REPORT d:filename /NOPAUSE

Options are:

                   /A - Examine all files for viruses
    /E .xxx .yyy .zzz - Clean overlay extensions .xxx .yyy .zzz
                  /FR - Display messages in French
               /MAINT - Clean DOS 4.0+ damaged boot sector
                /MANY - Check and disinfect multiple floppies
             /NOPAUSE - Disable screen prompting
   /REPORT d:filename - Create report of cleaned files
             
         d1: ... d10: - indicate drives to be cleaned
           [virus ID] - Virus identification code - provided by the
                        VIRUSCAN program when it detects a virus. 
                        For a complete list of codes, see the    
                        accompanying VIRLIST.TXT file            
            

     The /A option will cause CLEAN to go through all files on
diskette.  This should be used if an overlay-infecting virus is
detected.  
     The /E option allows the user to specify an extension or set
of extensions to clean.  Extensions must be separated by a space
after the /E and between each other.  Up to three extensions may
be added with the /E.  For more extensions, use the /A option.
     The /FR option tells CLEAN-UP to display all messages in
French instead of English.
     The /MAINT option is used to clean hard disks partitioned with
DOS 4.0 or above that have been damaged by a boot sector or partition
table infecting virus.  Attempts to access disks damaged in such a
manner result in an "invalid media" message being displayed.  The
/MAINT option will only clean the partition table and boot sector,
not the files.
     The /MANY option is used to clean multiple floppy diskettes.
If the user has more than one floppy disk to check for viruses, the
/MANY option will allows the user to check them without having to
run CLEAN multiple times.
     The /NOPAUSE option disables the "More..." prompt that appears
when CLEAN fills a screen with data.  This allows CLEAN-UP to run
on a machine with multiple infections without requiring operator
intervention when the screen fills up with messages from the CLEAN
program.
     The /REPORT option is used to generate a listing of
disinfected files.  The resulting list can be saved to disk as an
ASCII text file.  To use the report option, specify /REPORT on the
command line, followed by the device and filename.
