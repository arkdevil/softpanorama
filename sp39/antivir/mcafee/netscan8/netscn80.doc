SYNOPSIS

     NETSCAN is a virus detection and identification program from local
and wide area networks.  NETSCAN will search any networked drive
accesible as a DOS device, searching the networked drive(s) for both
known and unknown viruses.
     NETSCAN works by searching the system for instruction sequences
or patterns that are unique to each computer virus, and then reporting
their presence if found.  This method works for viruses that NETSCAN
recognizes.  To detect unknown viruses, NETSCAN can append a validation
code or "CRC Check" for .COM and .EXE files.  If the file has been
modified in any way, NETSCAN will report that an infection may have
occurred.  NETSCAN will also check for new viruses via a user-supplied
list of search strings.
     NETSCAN version V80, when used in conjunction with the VIRUSCAN
program on workstations, can identify all 293 computer virus strains
and the 714 varieties.
     For a complete listing of viruses detected, please read the
accompanying VIRLIST.TXT file.
     NETSCAN can be run off of any workstation with 256Kb and DOS 2.0
or above (Some options may require DOS 3.1 or above).  In order for
NETSCAN to check all areas of the  server for computer viruses,
NETSCAN should be run under an account with global read, write, and
create priveleges.  NETSCAN works with 3Com 3/Share and 3/Open, Novell
NetWare, Banyan VINES, DEC DECNet, Microsoft LAN Manager, PC/SA,
and NFSNet as well as IBMNET and NETBIOS compatible networks.  If you
do not see your network listed, contact McAfee Associates.


AUTHENTICITY

     NETSCAN runs a self-test when executed.  If NETSCAN has been
modified in any way, a warning will be displayed.  The program will
still continue to check for viruses, though.  If NETSCAN reports that
it has been damaged, it is recommended that a clean copy be
obtained.
     NETSCAN versions 51 and above are packaged with the VALIDATE
program to ensure the integrity of the NETSCAN.EXE file.  The
VALIDATE.DOC  instructions tell how to use the VALIDATE program.
The VALIDATE program distributed with NETSCAN may be used to check
all further versions of NETSCAN.

     The validation results for Version 80 should be:

              FILE NAME: NETSCAN.EXE
                   SIZE: 87,437
                   DATE: 06-24-1991
    FILE AUTHENTICATION
         Check Method 1: 705F
         Check Method 2: 04F6

If your copy of NETSCAN.EXE differs, it may have been modified.
Always obtain your copy of VIRUSCAN from a known source.  The
latest version of NETSCAN and validation data for NETSCAN.EXE can be obtained
off of McAfee Associates' bulletin board system at (408) 988-4004.

     Beginning with Version 72, all McAfee Associates programs for
download are archived with PKWare's PKZIP Authentic File
Verification.  If you do not see the "-AV" message after every file
is unzipped and receive the message "Authentic Files Verified!
# NWN405  Zip Source: McAFEE ASSOCIATES" when you unzip the files
then do not run them.  If your version of PKUNZIP does not have
verification ability, then this message may not be displayed.
Please contact McAfee Associates if your .ZIP file has been
tampered with.


COMMANDS

IMPORTANT NOTE:  NETSCAN SHOULD ALWAYS BE RUN FROM A WRITE-PROTECTED FLOPPY
DISK TO PREVENT NETSCAN FROM BECOMING INFECTED.

     To run NETSCAN type:

NETSCAN d1: ... d10: /A /D /E .xxx .yyy .zzz 
                /FR /M /NLZ /NOBREAK /NOMEM /NOPAUSE
                /REPORT d:filename /RV /UNATTEND

Options are:

                /A - Scan all files for viruses
                /D - Overwrite and delete infected files
 /E .xxx .yyy .zzz - Scan overlay extensions .xxx .yyy .zzz
               /FR - Display messages in French
                /M - Scan memory for all viruses
                     (see below for specifics)
              /NLZ - Skip scanning of LZEXE compressed files
          /NOBREAK - Disable Ctrl-C / Ctrl-Brk during scanning
            /NOMEM - Skip memory checking
          /NOPAUSE - Disable screen pause when scanning
/REPORT d:filename - Create report of infected files
         /UNATTEND - Scan network using error handler

           (d1: ... d10: indicate drives to be scanned)

     The /A option will cause NETSCAN to go through all files on the
referenced drive.  This should be used if a file-infecting virus has already
been detected.  Otherwise the /A option should only be used when checking a
new program.  The /A option will add a substantial time to scanning.  This
option takes priority over the /E option.


     The /D option tells NETSCAN to prompt the user to overwrite
and delete an infected file when one is found.  If the user selects
"Y" the infected file will be overwritten with hex code C3 [the
Return-to-DOS instruction] and then deleted.  A file erased by the
/D option can not be recovered.  If the McAfee Associates' CLEAN-
UP program is available, it is recommended that CLEAN be used to
remove the virus instead of NETSCAN, since in most cases it will
recover the infected file.  Boot sector and partition table
infectors can not be removed by the /D option and require the
CLEAN-UP virus disinfection program.

     The /E option allows the user to specify an extension or set
of extensions to scan.  Extensions should include the period
character "." and be separated by a space after the /E and between
each other.  Up to three extensions may be added with the /E.  For
more extensions, use the /A option.


     The /FR option tells NETSCAN to output all messages in French
instead of English.

     The /M option tells NETSCAN to check system memory of the
workstation it is running off of for all known computer viruses that
can inhabit memory.  NETSCAN by default only checks memory for
critical and "stealth" viruses, which are viruses which can cause
catastrophic damage or spread the infection during the scanning
process.  NETSCAN will check memory for the following viruses
in any case:

     1554          1971          1253          2100
     3445-Stealth  4096          512           Anthrax
     Brain         Dark Avenger  Disk Killer   Doom-2
     EDV           Fish6         Form          Invader
     Joshi         Microbes      Mirror        Murphy
     Nomenclature  Phantom       Plastique     Polish-2
     P1R (Phoenix) Taiwan-3      Whale         Zero-Hunt

If one of these viruses is found in memory, NETSCAN will stop and
advise the user to power down, and reboot the system from a
virus-free system disk.  Using the /M option with another
anti-viral software package may result in false alarms if the other
package does not remove its virus search strings from memory.  The
/M option will add 3 to 15 seconds to the scanning time.

     The /NLZ option tells NETSCAN not to look inside files
compressed with the LZEXE file compression program.  NETSCAN will
still check the programs for external infections.

     The /NOBREAK option disables Control-C or Control-Break from
stopping VIRUSCAN while running.  The /NOBREAK option only works if
BREAK=OFF has been added to the CONFIG.SYS file.

     The /NOMEM option is used to turn off all memory checking for
viruses.  It should only be used when a system is known to be free
of viruses.

     The /NOPAUSE option disables the "More..." prompt that appears
when NETSCAN fills up a screen with data.  This allows VIRUSCAN to run
on a machine with multiple infections without requiring operator
intervention when the screen fills up with messages from the NETSCAN
program.

     The /REPORT option is used to generate a listing of infected
files.  The resulting list is saved to disk as an ASCII text file.
To use the report option, specify /REPORT on the command line,
followed by the device and filename.

     The /UNATTEND option allows NETSCAN to continue scanning when a
non-shareable open file is scanned. 

NOTE:  The /UNATTEND options requires DOS 3.1 and above.  If your PC
is running an older version, then the /UNATTEND option will not
work.


OPERATION

     NETSCAN should be run while only the supervisor account is active
on the network.
	NETSCAN will require approximately 3 minutes of run time for each
1,000 files on the designated drive.
