     To install Additional Macros v.3.1 you should:

1) Copy INSTALL.MAC to your Multi-Edit 5.00 directory.

2) At DOS prompt, type

     ME /R INSTALL

The self-extracting archive MACROS31.EXE should be in current directory.
If you have a RAM drive, it is a good idea to copy MACROS31.EXE to the
RAM drive and then start Multi-Edit there.

3) Multi-Edit will start up and run INSTALL macro that will carry out
the installation.
