* SOME INFORMATION ON AUGMENTA.MAC MACROS
	1) /FontPath= filespec tells @AUGMENTA.HLP^CHANGE_FONT[Change_Font] where to look for font files.
To use the Change_Font macro, you must create a RAM-resident copy of the
SAVE_PTR table and set the text and or/graphics mode auxiliary font area
pointers. EGA_FNT.ASM and VGA_FNT.ASM are sample programs that perform the
task.

	2) Port_IO macro allows you to read from / write to 80x86 I/O ports.
Input:
	Return_Str should contain hexadecimal port number;
	Return_Int = value to send to port (for OUTB or OUTW commands).
	Macro command line must be one of the commands: INB, INW, OUTB, OUTW.
Output:
	Return_Str = '' -- no error, otherwise Return_Str = error message;
	Return_Int = value read from port (for INB or INW commands).

	3) The macro Call_Far lets you make a call to FAR routine somewhere
	in memory.
Input:
	Return_Int = 32 bit address (segment:offset) of far routine.

	4) The macro ACCENTS (assigned to <CNTR>) provides a means of
inputting international without the need to use an international keyboard
driver. When the cursor is under, or to the right of, the letter over which
you desire to place an accent, hit <CNTR> (i.e. <5> on numeric keypad) and
then the desired accent (', `, ^, ~, etc.). Alternatively, you can hit the
arrow key specifying the direction of the accent: <RT> for accent aigu, <LF>
for accent grave, <UP> for accent circonflexe, <CNTR> once more for tréma or
Umlaut. Here is the complete list of characters that will be translated:
	eauioycnEAUOCN!?bGpSsmgftWd80()=+><-_        will become
', or <RT>:
	éáúíóyçñÉAUOÇÑ¡¿ßΓπΣσµτΦΘΩδ∞φε∩≡±≥≤÷≈
^, or <UP>:
	êâûîôyçñEAUOÇÑ¡¿ßΓπΣσµτΦΘΩδ∞φε∩≡±≥≤÷≈
:, or <CNTR>:
	ëäüïöÿçñEÄÜÖÇÑ¡¿ßΓπΣσµτΦΘΩδ∞φε∩≡±≥≤÷≈
`, or <LF>:
	èàùìòyçñEAUOÇÑ¡¿ßΓπΣσµτΦΘΩδ∞φε∩≡±≥≤÷≈
CHANGE_FONT CHANGING SCREEN FONT
	Select one of the listed font files and hit ^B<CR>^b to install the new
font. Hit ^B<ESC>^b to abort operation.
FONTPATH FIND SCREEN FONT FILES
	Please specify the drive, path, and filespec to find screen font
files. These files should contain the bit images of all 256 characters. They
must have length 4096 bytes for the VGA and 3584 bytes for the EGA. Press ^B<CR>^b
to get the list of available font files as a menu.
TAB_OPERATIONS TAB OPERATIONS CONTROL PANEL
	This control panel gives you full access to the power of Multi-Edit's
treatment of tab characters.

TABEXP TOGGLE TAB EXPANSION MODE
	The @ME.HLX^INEDTA[Tab Expansion] setting will be changed for current editing
session only.
TABSPAC CHANGE TAB SPACING
	Tab spacing determines the interval between two successive tab stops.
The default @ME.HLX^FE_TAB[Install, Filename Extensions] setting will be changed for current
editing session only.
DISPLTABS DISPLAY TABS TOGGLE
	This is the same toggle as in @ME.HLX^DSPTABS[Menu, Layout]. Note that if your current
@ME.HLX^INEDTA[Tab Expansion] setting is Spaces then tabs will not be displayed even if they
are actually present in your file.
INS_IN_TABLE INSERTING TABS IN A TABLE
	You will hardly ever need to do this. If your file is split into
columns starting at fixed positions then you can adjust the @ME.HLX^EDFMTLIN[format line]
so that tab stops would correspond to column starting positions. Having done
that, you can slightly compress your file substituting a single tab character
for trailing spaces in each column.
COMPRESS COMPRESS LEADING SPACES
	In a structured programming language, statements are usually indented,
their offset from start of line corresponding to their nesting level. You can
reduce the size of your program file if you replace the leading spaces by tab
characters, having set the proper tab spacing. A typical program would shrink
to two-thirds of its initial volume due to that operation.
TABS_TO_SPACES CONVERTING TABS TO SPACES
	Multi-Edit has great flexibility in handling tab characters. But
sometimes you would be happier if there were no tabs in your file, for other
programs may treat them in a different way. If you run ^BConvert tabs to spaces^b
from this menu, the text in your file will look exactly the same way as
before, but all white space will be filled with spaces (ASCII 32).
MODFMTLIN MODIFYING THE FORMAT LINE
	If you reply "Yes", and the first tab stop in your current format line
does not correspond to the currently set Tab spacing, then the format line
will be modified so that the tab stops will be every ^B<Tab spacing>^b columns.
KEY_ASS CURRENT MULTI-EDIT KEY ASSIGNMENT
	This menu provides an easy way to learn about the keyboard shortcuts
available in Multi-Edit. From this menu, you can run any of the macros
available in EDIT mode. Hit ^B<CR>^b to build the command line to invoke the
selected macro. You can then edit the command line, possibly adding or
changing command-line parameters.
	NOTE. You cannot run @MACRO.HLX^CMDTOKEY[Commands directly assigned to a key] from this
menu.
