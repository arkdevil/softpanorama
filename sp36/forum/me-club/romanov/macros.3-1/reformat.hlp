* REFORMAT OPTIONS
	The following dialog box allows you to set options and reformat either
a single paragraph down from current line, or all paragraphs within a marked
line block. The new Smart Hyphenation Engine developed by Alex Romanov is
capable of recognizing Russian prefixes and disallowing such awkward
hyphenations as ¢Î£-´Ô§Î¢†‚Ï, ‡†ß°-‡†·Î¢†‚Ï, °•-ß´®™®©, and the like. However,
if a hyphenation is possible, you can count on the Engine not to miss it!
Select any topic to get more specific info about options. See below on fine-
tuning REFORMAT.MAC macros and on criteria used to single out paragraphs.

The macro Russ_Reformat can process either one single paragraph starting
at current line, or multiple paragraphs contained in a marked line block.
This macro assumes a line to be the last line of a paragraph if one of the
following conditions holds:
	1) The next line is blank, or contains a page break.
	2) The next line starts at other column than specified as actual text
		left margin.
	3) Current line contains hard carriage return. This character is set
		by the system variable Hard_Cr.

You can change default settings by specifying command-line parameters for
CONTROL_HYPHENS macro:

        /NH Initial setting: Hyphenation ...                Disabled
        /YU Initial setting: Hyphenate uppercase words ...  Yes
        /NJ Initial setting: Right justify text ...         No
        /CR=Hard carriage return (if you wish to use one).

Other input parameters are those to be passed to RUSS_REFORMAT.
These are:
        /U  Do NOT turn off Undo while reformatting.
                Undo is normally turned off to speed up execution and to
                save memory. By passing /U to RUSS_REFORMAT you can force
                using Undo, but you can run out of memory for Undo buffer
                (reformatting is a "heavy" operation).
        /___S - commands RUSS_REFORMAT to stay resident. For obvious
                reasons, you would not use this on CONTROL_HYPHENS command
                line. However, you can adjust the parameters below that
                pertain to resident mode.
        /R= stay-on row. This is the row in the window on which you
                stay when inserting new text. The default value is
                calculated to be the middle row of your window.
        /IC= column of the flashing "FRM" message on the status line.
                        The default value is 33.

RM SETTING RIGHT MARGIN
	This setting is the same as in @ME.HLX^RTMARG[Menu, Layout].
See also @REFORMAT.HLP^*[General Information].
TOGGLE PARAGRAPH/LINE BLOCK TOGGLE
	This field tells @REFORMAT.HLP^REFORMAT[Reformat] whether it should process a single paragraph
or a marked line block. See @REFORMAT.HLP^*[General Information] on the criteria used to single
out a paragraph.
HARD_CR HARD CARRIAGE RETURN SETTING
	If your paragraphs are not indented, nor separated by blank lines, you
can still preserve them while reformatting if you terminate them by a special
byte called Hard Carriage Return. By the default, it is null byte (and not
used in this case), but you can choose any other ASCII character not used for
other purposes in your text. Pass that character as /CR= on the macro parameter
line for CONTROL_HYPHENS macro. See also @REFORMAT.HLP^*[General Information].
ENABLE ENABLING/DISABLING HYPHENATION
	Use this toggle to control whether hyphens should be inserted while
reformatting. If for some reason you have to eliminate all hyphens from a
text, just disable hyphenation and select @REFORMAT.HLP^REFORMAT[Start Reformatting] button.
All existing hyphens will be deleted and no new hyphens will be inserted.
See also @REFORMAT.HLP^*[General Information].
UPPERCASE HYPHENATING UPPERCASE WORDS
	If you don't mind such hyphenations as èêé-ãéÉ, ûçÖ-ëäé, etc. then
check this box. Otherwise, hyphenation of words typed in capital letters
will be disallowed. See also @REFORMAT.HLP^*[General Information].
JUSTIFY TURNING JUSTIFICATION ON/OFF
	If this box is checked then all lines of the reformatted text will
be right justified. See also @REFORMAT.HLP^*[General Information].
ENTER_INDENT AUTOMATIC INDENT FOR NEW PARAGRAPH
	This setting tells @REFORMAT.HLP^RESIDENT[Resident Reformat] that whenever ^B<Enter>^b is hit,
the cursor should be moved to the specified column. This can be useful when
you type in new text and strike ^B<Enter>^b to start a new paragraph, if the first
line of your paragraphs must start at other column than the rest lines.
ATLM SPECIFYING ACTUAL TEXT LEFT MARGIN
	Please note that if you are reformatting or unjustifying an existing
text, then this parameter is used as a test for paragraph end. See
@REFORMAT.HLP^*[General Information] for details. For @REFORMAT.HLP^RESIDENT[Resident Reformat], it actually sets the
left margin for the newly-typed text.
RESIDENT RESIDENT REFORMAT
	Resident mode of RUSS_REFORMAT performs automatic wordwrap taking care
of hyphenation (if it is @REFORMAT.HLP^ENABLE[Enabled]) and right justifies the lines as they are
being typed in (if @REFORMAT.HLP^JUSTIFY[Justify] is on). The flashing ^1FRM^0 message will appear on
the status line, informing you that Resident Reformat is active. From inside
Resident Reformat, all the editor operations should work just fine, but still
it is recommended to have it installed only while typing new text.
See also @REFORMAT.HLP^*[General Information].
REFORMAT REFORMAT
	Depending on the current setting of field 2 in this menu, either one
paragraph or a number of paragraphs within a marked line block will be
reformatted (with hyphenation, if it is @REFORMAT.HLP^ENABLE[Enabled]). See @REFORMAT.HLP^*[General Information]
on the criteria used to single out a paragraph.
INSIDE WORKING INSIDE THE RESIDENT REFORMAT MACRO
	The flashing ^1FRM^0 message on the status line tells you that Resident
Reformat is currently active. As you type, it performs wordwrap automatically,
inserting hyphens where possible (if hyphenation is @REFORMAT.HLP^ENABLE[Enabled], and right
justifies the inputted text (if the @REFORMAT.HLP^JUSTIFY[Justify] toggle is set to ^BYes^b. It is a good
idea to exit Resident Reformat (by hitting ^B<ESC>^b) once you're through with
typing and planning to switch to other editing operations.
	Typically, Reformat will let you type several Cyrillic letters beyond
the right margin before attempting to wrap onto the next line. This is
necessary to ensure quality hyphenation in all cases. You can always command
Reformat to word wrap current line by hitting ^B<END>^b key.
	When inside Resident Reformat, you can quickly reformat a paragraph
down from current line by hitting ^B<AltR>^b. Other keys specially processed:
^B<ESC>^b -- Uninstall Resident Reformat,
^B<CtrlV>^b -- Version information.
