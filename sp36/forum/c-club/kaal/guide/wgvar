!short: WINDOW
  When the new window is created with makewnd(), the new structure
 will be added to linked list of windows. This structure has following
 fields :

  o Frame corner coordinates. These are the maximum coordinates for
    viewport, which may change. Corner coordinates are used later to
    restore the screen contents, so try not to screw them up.
  o Viewport corner coordinates. They are used for ouputting, scrolling
    and clearing the window and to position cursor inside the window.
    You may change them if you need, but avoid going over the limits
    defined with frame corners. These coordinates are normally set
    so, that frame will be saved on output.
  o Saved cursor position and size. They will be restored, when window
    is closed, so you can fool around with cursor any way you want.
  o Colour used to open this window. Could be useful when you want to
    output something to yuor window.
  o Two pointers pointing to next and previous structure. They are the
    only link in this world, if you open 3 windows, using pushwnd() twice
    and then use closewnd(), all your windows will be gone forever!
  o Current cursor position. Used by putcwnd() when emulating teletype.
  o Cursor position before push.

 Here is how it looks in WINDOW.H

!short: VMENU
  As creating a menu isn't very easy, the number of parameters in function
 call would be enormous. Besides, most of these parameters never change
 in one program. So, why bother, let's put most of them into structure...
 The menu structure has following fields:

  o Flags indicating what to do with menu window and texts printed in it.
  o Pointer to 9 successive characters used to draw window frame.
  o Colours for window, normal items, selection bar, highlited characters.
  o Item number you want the menu bar initially to be on.

 Here is how it looks in WINDOW.H

!short: _curntwnd


  This is defined in WINDOW.H as "extern WINDOW far *_curntwnd", it's
  pointing to active window structure all the time if there is any opened
  windows. Else it's NULL pointer, meaning that we don't have any windows
  opened yet. It may not be pointing to the window you opened last, because
  pushwnd() and popwnd() may move it around.
