                    A few important rules for
                        Real Programmers


Real  Programmers  don't  write  specs  -  users  should   consider
themselves lucky to get any programs at all and take what they get.

Real Programmers don't comment their code. It was hard to write, it 
should be hard to read.

Real  Programmers  don't  write  application programs, they program
right down on the bare metal. Application programming is for  feebs
who can't do system programming.

Real Programmers don't eat quiche. They eat Twinkies, and  Szechwan
food.

Real  Programmers  don't  write  in  COBOL.  COBOL  is  for   wimpy
application programmers.

Real Programmers programs never work  right the first time. But  if
throw them on the machine they can be patched into working in 'only
a few' 30-hour debugging sessions.

Real Programmers don't write in FORTRAN. FORTRAN is for pipe stress
freaks and crystallography weenies.

Real Programmers  never work  9 to  5. If  any real programmers are
around at 9 AM it's because they were up all night.

Real Programmers  don't write  in BASIC.  Actually, no  programmers
write in BASIC, after the age of 12.

Real Programmers don't write in  PL/I. PL/I is for programmers  who
can't decide whether to write in COBOL or FORTRAN.

Real Programmers  don't write  in APL.  Any fool  can be obscure in
APL.

Real  Programmers  don't  play  tennis,  or  any  other  sport that
requires you to change clothes.  Mountain climbing is OK, and  Real
Programmers wear their  climbing boots to  work in case  a mountain
should suddenly spring up in the middle of the machine room.

Real Programmers  don't document.  Documentation is  for simps  who
can't read the listings or the object deck.

Real Programmers don't write in PASCAL, or BLISS, or ADA, or any of
those computer science languages. Strong typing is for people  with
weak memories.

Real Programmers know better than the users what they need.

Real Programmers think structured programming is a Communist plot.

Real Programmers don't use  schedules. Schedules are for  manager's
toadies. Real Programmers like to keep their managers in suspense.

Real Programmers think better when playing ADVENTURE.

Real Programmers enjoy setting CP/M to work on 370 machines and MVS
on their ZX81s.

Real Programmers never get  annoyed by security systems,  they turn
off the RACF bits and leave unsigned messages in the security  data
sets.

Real Programmers never update the source to reflect the ZAPs, after
all, it will be changed again tomorrow.

Real Programmers don't test. Testing is for people with weak nerves
and no self-confidence.

Real  Programmers  programs  are   always  recursive  and  run   in
supervisor state, else programming is no real fun.

Real Programmers never take backup.
