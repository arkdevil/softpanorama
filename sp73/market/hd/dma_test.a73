Formatting a floppy in the background uses DMA in the background.

A busmastering SCSI controller, like the Adaptec 154x series, also uses
DMA in the background to run hard drives.

The "formatting a floppy in the background" is a useful standin test for
ANY device that uses background DMA : busmastering cards, sound boards, etc.
