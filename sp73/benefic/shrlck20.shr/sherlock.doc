                                    SHERLOCK

        SHERLOCK is designed to do one job, compare two ASCII files line
        by line.  When the lines do not match, SHERLOCK raises a flag.
        At that point, you may scroll either or both files past the
        mismatch to put them in sync and then continue.  SHERLOCK
        contains features for searching, jumping around the files,
        restarting, and copying lines to a printer.  SHERLOCK does not
        write to either file.

        SHERLOCK is designed as a tool for programmers, writers and
        workstation support personnel.  It is best on files like program
        source files, AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, and text documents.

        SHERLOCK displays five lines of each file in separate windows.
        The line from each file that is being compared is in the center
        of the window and highlighted.  When the center lines in each
        window do not match, a message indicating this pops up between
        the windows.  The top line of each window frame displays the line
        number of the center line and the name of the file.

        SHERLOCK is started by entering one of the following commands:

                            SHERLOCK

                            SHERLOCK filename1

                            SHERLOCK filename1 filename2

                            SHERLOCK filename1 d:\*

        If you do not enter a filename or filenames, SHERLOCK will prompt
        you.  If you want to have the exact same file in both windows for
        learning SHERLOCK, enter only an asterisk for the second file
        name.  SHERLOCK will substitute the first file name for the
        asterisk.

        If you are comparing two files with the same name that are on
        different disks or in different directories, enter the filename
        that is in the current directory as filename1, either on the DOS
        command line or at the prompt in SHERLOCK.  For the second file
        name, enter the drive or path followed by an asterisk (no space
        between the path and the asterisk).  Again, SHERLOCK will
        substitute the first file name for the asterisk.

        These instructions will be easier to understand if you are
        running SHERLOCK while you are reading them.  You can try each
        function as you read about it.  Print a copy of these
        instructions if you haven't done so.  They are about 16 pages.
        To print them, use the DOS command:


                                     -1-



                            COPY SHERLOCK.DOC PRN

        Use the file SHERLOCK.DOC as the text file to learn on.  To run
        SHERLOCK with this file in both windows, enter the DOS command:

                            SHERLOCK SHERLOCK.DOC  *

        The asterisk causes the first file name, SHERLOCK.DOC, to be also
        used as the second file name.

        SHERLOCK starts by displaying the title screen.  It explains how
        to register this Shareware program.  The bottom line of the
        screen prompts for an M if you are using a monochrome monitor,
        otherwise press any other key to continue.  If there is NOT a
        border line around the title screen on your display, press M.

        The following is a list of operations that can be activated by
        function keys.

                           FUNCTION KEYS

                       FK 1    Help; also Shift FK 1 & Ctl FK 1
                       FK 2    Jump to a Line
                       FK 3    Search
                       FK 4    Jump to DOS (Shell)
                       FK 5    Open a New File
                       FK 6    Reverse Scroll Action
                       FK 7    Print Lines
                       FK 8    Print Registration Form
                       FK 9    Toggle Display ON/OFF
                       FK 10   SCAN Start/Stop (Toggle)

        There are three help windows that contain most of the information
        that you need to effectively operate SHERLOCK.

        H or Function Key 1 pops up help window #1.  Shift FK 1 pops up
        help window #2.  Control FK 1 pops up help window #3.  Whenever a
        help window is open, another help window can be viewed by
        pressing its relative function key or number on either set of
        numeric keys.

        You may step through the help windows by pressing the space bar,
        the H key, the Up and Down arrows, and Page Up and Page Down.  So
        if help window #1 is open, just press the number 3 to get the
        third help window, then 2 to get the second, or whatever one you
        want.  Or, just keep pressing H.  SHERLOCK turns the Num Lock on
        and off for you so that you can use the digits 1, 2, 3.

        Functions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 open a window with information
        or a menu.




                                     -2-



        Function 10 (or the Enter key) toggles the scan mode on and off.
        The scan mode continuously scrolls the lines in each window one
        line, then compares them.  The scan continues until two lines are
        found that do not match, the end of either file is reached,
        function key 10 (or the Enter key) is pressed again, or the ESC
        key is pressed.

        Function key 9 (or the space bar) controls whether the text lines
        will be displayed during the scan mode.  The reason for not
        displaying the text during the scan mode is to speed the scan
        rate.  Function key 9 (or the space bar) toggles a flag that
        indicates the status of the display mode.  This flag is not
        visible until the toggle is first pressed.  The text is always
        displayed when the scan mode is off.  When the scan stops, all
        lines are immediately displayed.

        Function key 6 reverses the direction that the text in the
        windows will scroll when commanded by Page Up, Page Down, and the
        Up and Down arrow keys.  The direction in effect is indicated by
        an up or down arrow in the Function Key Window.

        The ESC key can be used to stop any activity in SHERLOCK.  It is
        also used to exit the program.

        Function Key 1 produces the following list of the action keys
        that move the text in the windows.  This is also Help Window 1.

                                  ACTION KEYS

                   Page Up            Scroll both windows up
                   Page Down          Scroll both windows down

                   Control End        End of       Top file
                     Shift Home       Beginning of Bottom file
                     Shift End        End of       Bottom file

                   Ins          Scroll top window until Match
                   Del          Scroll botm window until Match

        Help Window 2 provides reminders on additional action keys,
        information on help, commands for editing input to prompts, and
        commands for the search feature.  This window can be displayed by
        pressing 2 when another help window is open or with Shift FK 1
        otherwise.

                                  Help Window 3


        The SHIFTED commands - Page Up, Page Down, Home, End, and arrows
        - now work on enhanced keyboards that have cursor keys separate
        from the numeric keypad.  These commands still work on the
        numeric keypad.  Remember, shift always affects action in the
        second window.  Even shift FK 1 displays the second help window.

        SHIFT with FK 10, RETURN, INS, or DEL produces the defined action
        in the OPPOSITE Direction.

        If the scan mode is off, pressing ESC, Q, or X will open a window
        to ask if you really want to quit SHERLOCK.  Pressing ESC, Q, X,
        Y, or RETURN then will end SHERLOCK; any other key will continue
        SHERLOCK.

        SHERLOCK uses the arrow keys on the numeric keypad and on the
        separate cursor keypad.  SHERLOCK turns the Num Lock off when it
        starts.  It turns it on again when you press a function key that
        requests numeric input, then turns it off again.  So don't touch
        the Num Lock key when using SHERLOCK, it's automatic.

        Function Key 4 puts you in DOS to run DOS programs.  The
        technical term is Shell to DOS.  SHERLOCK has not ended and is
        still in memory.  You may not have enough memory to run some
        programs.  Enter the DOS command EXIT to return to SHERLOCK.  To
        exit SHERLOCK when you are done and remove it from memory, press
        ESC, Q, or X twice.

        SHERLOCK has the capability to perform a search.  You initiate a
        search or change the search text by pressing Function Key 3 or S.


                                     -5-



        It prompts for input from a pop up window.  When a search is
        initiated this way, the search starts at the highlighted line.
        When a match is found, every occurrence of the matched text on
        that line is highlighted.  There is a mode where all lines that
        have a match can be sent to your printer.

        Whenever there is a string in the search buffer to search for,
        the phrase "C = Continue Search" is displayed at the bottom of
        your screen.  By pressing C, the search will continue on the next
        line after the highlighted line.  If it doesn't find another
        occurrence of the search string, it will tell you so and will
        return to the line from where it started.

        When SHERLOCK is executing the Continue Search command, it opens
        a window at the bottom of the screen to indicate its status.  If
        SHERLOCK finds the string quickly and/or you have a fast
        computer, this message will appear and disappear too quick to
        read or even identify.

        Note the difference between Search and Continue Search.  Search
        starts looking for a match at the beginning of the highlighted
        line.  Continue Search starts looking at the line after the
        highlighted line.

        When SHERLOCK prompts for text input such as a filename or search
        text, the input can be edited with all the usual keyboard editing
        functions.  The entire input line can be erased with the ESC key.
        When the insert mode is on, the word INSERT is displayed in the
        lower right corner of the screen.  When the text line is too long
        to fit in the window, the text will scroll horizontally.

        Function key 7 will print lines of the text files on your
        printer.  It will also skip lines or eject pages (form feed).
        You can print blank lines or eject a page when no function key
        window is open.  Press the L key to skip a line or the E key to
        eject a page.

        SHERLOCK will trap errors when your printer is OFF or OFF LINE.
        A window will pop up to tell you so.  You may turn your printer
        ON and ON LINE, then hit RETURN, and SHERLOCK will continue.  Or
        press ESC, Q, or X and SHERLOCK will skip the printing.

        Some computers do not respond for 30 to 60 seconds to the program
        when a printer is OFF LINE or OFF.  In my experience this has
        always occurred when the printer is ON but OFF LINE.  This
        timeout period is controlled by DOS.  SHERLOCK will not be able
        to display the error window until the DOS timeout period ends.
        If you accidentally press L (Line Feed) or E (Eject Page) and
        your printer is not ready, or it is not ready when you want to
        print, then you may have to wait 30 to 60 seconds for SHERLOCK to
        get back in control.  If SHERLOCK ever locks up, wait at least a
        minute before rebooting.  You may not have to.

        SHERLOCK remembers when you select the parameter to use the
        printer in the search mode until you change it in the "Find All &
        send to printer" prompt.  However, if a printer error window pops
        up and you select the option to quit printing, SHERLOCK will
        change this search parameter to no printing.

        When a highlighted line is longer then 78 characters, the color
        of the 78th character is black on white to alert you to the fact
        that there is more text.  Press the right arrow key to see more
        of the right end of the line.  This will scroll the center line
        in both windows horizontally 20 characters for each press.  The
        left arrow key scrolls the lines back.

        The animated title of SHERLOCK is now an option.  To activate it
        for a single run, include in the command string

                                      /D

        after the file names.  You can permanently modify SHERLOCK so
        that the title will always dance.  To do so, run SHERLOCK from
        the default directory, i.e. SHERLOCK must be in the directory
        that you are running from, and include

                                     /DANCE

        in the command string.  As always, the animated title can be
        halted instantly by pressing any key.

        SHERLOCK requires 256 K of free memory and DOS 2.1 or later.


        Technical Note:  Information in the following section is NOT
        required for you to use SHERLOCK.  It is presented as technical
        information for the serious computer user who enjoys optimizing
        software for maximum performance.  Please skip to the next

        section - SHAREWARE - if you wish.

        Regardless of how much memory your computer has, the compiler
        used for SHERLOCK only allows about 64,000 bytes of memory for
        string space.  The lines of data from the two files you are
        comparing occupy this space.  There is no limit to the length of
        the document SHERLOCK can process.  SHERLOCK keeps 200 lines of
        each file in memory at a time.  When it gets to line 198, it
        releases the first 100 lines and reads the next 100 lines from
        your disk.

        SHERLOCK has a method for you to measure memory available so that
        you can make adjustments to make optimum use of memory.  The M
        command displays string memory usage.  This is a toggle, so it
        turns the display on then off.  The M command causes numbers to
        be displayed in the upper left corner of the screen in the
        following relative positions.

        The numbers on the first line represent the values of the free
        string space before reading files, after reading the first file,
        and after reading the second file, respectively.

        The second line displays the current free string space and the
        total file buffer size in lines.

        You may set total lines for the file buffer by entering

                                   /B=n

        after the file names, if any, on the command line.  n is a number
        like 400.  The default is 200, which allocates 200 lines for each
        file.  If you have enough memory, as indicated by first value on
        the second line, and you scroll back and forth often, then a
        larger value may increase speed by requiring less pausing for disk
        access when manipulating long files.

        If after evaluating SHERLOCK, you decide to use it or keep it for
        when you will need it, then you MUST submit the registration fee.
        The registration form is at the end of the documentation and a

        When you register SHERLOCK you will receive:

                  Telephone and mail support.
                  A copy of the latest version of SHERLOCK
                  A loan amortization program with both the
                    BASIC source code and the compiled
                    program.  No registration is required for
                    the amortization program. 
                  Copies of PC-ACCOUNT and DISKLIST for you
                    to try before registering.

        Your registered copy of SHERLOCK will NOT display the Shareware
        screen at the end of the program.

        Because I will send you all of this software, please indicate on
        the registration form the size of the floppy disks that you can
        use.

        Most copies of software on bulletin boards and even in software
        vendor libraries are not the latest version.  It takes a long
        time for these to get around, and most of the effort is placed on
        the widest distribution of the initial release.  And with so much
        emphases being placed on 'safe software' these days, where is
        there a more reliable place to obtain your software than directly
        from an ASP author.

        If you do not like SHERLOCK, please let me know that you tried it
        and, if you wish, why you will not use it again.  Tell me what
        features would have made SHERLOCK useful to you.  Many features
        in my software were suggested by people who did not register.
        And of course, many more were suggested by those who did
        register.  You may use the registration form to reply and cross
        out the word Registration.

        Please report discrepancies (bugs) that you find in SHERLOCK.
        Include sufficient information for me to replicate the incident.
        When I correct a bug, the person who reported it gets the first
        revised copy.

        Whenever you write, please include your home phone number.  I
        like to hear about your experiences with SHERLOCK.  You can also
        send CompuServe Mail to me.  My CompuServe ID is 73270,77.  I

                                    PC-ACCOUNT

        PC-ACCOUNT is a personal accounting system with data base
        retrieval capabilities.  With it, you can discard your checkbook
        ledger.  Its most unique feature is its ability to print on any
        personal check.

        Personal checks are usually not designed for the normal line
        spacing of 6 lines per inch.  This program utilizes the variable
        line spacing of most printers to achieve the efficiency and
        accuracy of having your computer print on your checks.  A utility
        lets you create formats for fifteen different checking accounts.
        The check is printed as soon as the transaction is completed.
        The amount is printed on the check in words.

        A directory is maintained of check payees and memo data to be
        printed on the check, such as its purpose or your account number
        with the payee.  Payees are selected by number, and the name and
        memo are automatically transferred to the check.

        Searches can be made for all transactions against an account, for
        a user defined code, for an amount, for a text string within the
        comment, or for a check number.  These searches can be made
        through any selected consecutive months, so a full years
        transactions in a specific category can be retrieved at tax time.

        Recurring transactions such as loan payments and cash
        distributions to accounts can be saved, edited and invoked on
        command for auto entry.  There is a routine that can reconcile
        your bank statement swiftly.  Another routine double checks the
        line by line totals in your checkbook.

        This system makes full use of the features of the IBM PC.  All 10
        function keys are used.  Listings of accounts and transactions
        can be output to the screen, to the printer, to a disk text file,
        or to a file that can be imported by Lotus 1-2-3.

        This software works on the IBM PC/XT/AT with 256K of free memory
        and at least 1 double sided disk drive.  It runs under PC DOS 2.1
        and later versions.  It is distributed on bulletin boards,
        CompuServe, and by Shareware disk vendors.  It comes in three
        files: PCACT220.TXT, PCDOC220.EXE, and PCACT220.EXE.

                                     DISKLIST

        DISKLIST is designed to print the directory of a disk on a sheet
        of paper in a format that is the size of the floppy so that it
        can be trimmed to fit into the floppy disk sleeve.  It will also
        send the output to the screen or to a file.  DISKLIST lists the
        contents of all of the subdirectories on the disk.  DISKLIST
        provides an easy method to configure the output.

        Here is an example of one output of DISKLIST.  ASCII lines were
        selected for this display so that it would print properly on all
        printers.  If your printer can print the IBM graphics characters
        (lines, boxes, etc.) then you can select IBM lines and the frame
        will be smooth single or double lines.

        IBM Graphics Example

        This is an example of another format for the DISKLIST output.  It
        can be seen on the computer screen and printed on a printer setup
        for IBM graphics.  If this figure is not framed in continuous
        lines, then your printer is not setup for IBM graphics.  Read
        your printer manual to determine if it is possible to switch to
        that mode.  Otherwise, you can still use DISKLIST with the ASCII
        character frame as illustrated on page 1.
