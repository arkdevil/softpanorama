                        DoubleTake File Comparator Version 1.6
                                  by John L. Dove III
                                Copyright (c) 1985-1991

          1.   What is DoubleTake?  

               It's a side by side (actually, one on top of the other) file-
          compare program  to locate differences in  any files, particularly
          in  source code programs.   This  program was  previously released
          under the name GoodLook.   DoubleTake is a bit more  indicative of
          its  functions than  the  name GoodLook.    Here is  a summary  of
          DoubleTake features:   (See the History file,  DublTake.HST to see
          the changes between versions.)

               Compared lines  show on  the middle screen  lines for  direct
                    comparison.
               Pop-up Menu selections or single keys to invoke options.
               Built-in directory routines allow you to select a file if you
                    don't enter the names on the command line.  You can even
                    View a file in the directory, to see if it's the correct
                    file, prior to loading it.
               Wildcard (*) can be  used for second filename  for simplicity
                    (e.g., DT file.prg *.bak loads DT file.prg file.bak).
               Load new file on-the-fly while inside DoubleTake.
               Choice of  three scrolling  modes:   Parallel or Opposite  or
                    ZOOMed.
               Highlight modes for the two compared lines  include:  Normal,
                    Reverse video and Flashing.    
               Fully  configurable  options:   Colors,  Type  of  Scrolling,
                    Hex/ASCII Mode, etc.
               Find Next Mismatch function key to locate the next spot where
                    the file lines differ.  The search can be interrupted at
                    any  time by pressing any key.  The first mismatch found
                    is shown highlighted.
               Hex  mode shows any file (even binary) with option to display
                    non-printing chars (ASCII 1-31) and  Graphics characters
                    (ASCII 128-255)  or to show them as  periods (similar to
                    Debug).
               Two Hex Modes to show a file in Debug style (24 characters on
                    a line) and in full 80 column mode.
               WordStar(tm)  mode to  strip  the high  bits from  characters
                    before displaying them. (Can  be entered on command line
                    or toggled while viewing a file.
               Ignore  All Blanks  function to  allow comparing  files while
                    ignoring different spacing between them.
               Selectable Ignore Characters  to allow you  to customize
                    the  characters  you  want  DoubleTake  to  Ignore.
                    ASCII  Chart  reference  available  while  choosing
                    Ignore characters.
               Help available at the press of [F1].
               Configuration file presets can be saved to disk.
               Full DOS path  support.  DoubleTake will search your existing
                    path to find its configuration files.

               Simple, intuitive file movement using the keypad and assorted
                    keys.  Alternate keys  are also available if  you prefer
                    to  use the Function  Keys.    You can  scroll the files
                    independently  or together.   In Hex mode  the files are
                    fully scrollable forward and backward.
               Align function--at any time, you can bring one file up to the
                    location of the other file.
               Print  Screen toggle.   To  prevent accidental  Print Screen,
                    PrtSc  is toggled off at startup.   If you wish to print
                    any screen, you may toggle PrtSc back on at any time.
               Zoom Feature--You can zoom either file up to full screen.
               Single file view mode available from the command line.
               EGA/VGA supported
                    -- will use any number of lines found
                    -- invoke the 43/50 line mode from the command line.
                    -- toggle between 25 and 43/50 line modes on-line
               Shell to DOS  capability allows  you to return  to the  exact
                    spot in DoubleTake.

          2.   Running DoubleTake.

               DoubleTake is named DT.EXE for  ease and speed of use.   (You
          may rename  it to any filename  you choose, but do  NOT rename the
          help file, DublTake.HLP.)  NOTE:  Ensure the name doesn't conflict
          with other  programs  in your  path.   For  example, if  you  have
          Norton's DiskTest.exe  (also named  DT.EXE) visible in  your path,
          you  may accidentally  run DiskTest  instead of DoubleTake.   Just
          change the name  of DoubleTake  to any other  name to  accommodate
          this conflict.

               a.   Command line arguments.  Type at the DOS prompt:

          C:\DT [<File1>] [<File2>] [/w][/x][/1][/4] 

          and press the [Return] or [Enter] key.  The arguments following DT
          are as follows:

               <File1>  and  <File2>  are  optional filenames  (if  none  is
                    entered, you will be prompted for each).
               /w  is an optional WordStar(tm)  flag to strip  the high bits
                    from  characters before  displaying them  (you know  the
                    funny  characters you see at the  end of every word in a
                    WordStar(tm)  file which  was  created  in the  Document
                    mode.)   The /w parameter is  position-independent.  You
                    can put it  as the 1st, 2nd or 3rd  argument and it will
                    be interpreted correctly.
               /1  flag allows you  to use DoubleTake as  a single file View
                    program.  This shows  the file in full screen  mode (see
                    Zoom feature in next section.)  If you forget this flag,
                    DoubleTake will  assume you  want one  file only if  you
                    only enter one file on the  command line.  If you want a







          DOUBLETAKE DOCUMENTATION                                    Page 3

                    second file to compare, use  the [Alt-N] command to load
                    the second file in DoubleTake.
               /x  flag starts  DoubleTake in  Hex mode.   Default  is value
                    saved in Configuration file. 
               /4 flag  toggles the 43/50  line mode if  an EGA/VGA card  is
                    installed.  (if CNF file says 25, starts in 43/50, etc.)

               b.   Command Line filenames options.

               If  you are comparing the same filename on another disk, just
          enter the  drive letter followed by a colon and the first filename
          will automatically be added to the drive letter.

               (e.g.,  DT Filename.typ B: will  compare Filename.typ and    
                    B:Filename.typ.)

               If you are comparing a filename with its BAK file, just enter
          the main filename, followed by *.BAK.

               (e.g., DT Filename.prg  *.bak will compare  Filename.prg
                    and Filename.bak).

               You  can also  refer to  a different  drive\path at  the same
          time.

               (e.g.,   DT   Filename.prg    b:\path\*.bak   will    compare
                    Filename.prg and b:\path\filename.bak)

               It  is important that you  list the *.bak  filename after the
          complete filename.  

                         (e.g.,  DT File.typ *.bak is correct, but
                         not DT *.bak file.typ.)

               c.   Locating   DoubleTake  Support   Files.     At  startup,
          DoubleTake   searches  several   places  looking   for  its   help
          (DUBLTAKE.HLP) and configuration  (DUBLTAKE.CNF) file.   The first
          place it looks is  the current drive and directory  from which you
          entered the command to invoke DoubleTake.   Next it checks to  see
          if  you have entered a  SET DT environmental  variable command and
          checks to see if its files are  in that location.  Failing to find
          them,  it   checks  the   location  of  the   currently  executing







          DOUBLETAKE DOCUMENTATION                                    Page 4

          DoubleTake.exe.  Finally, if  it has had no success, it checks any
          Path you have to see if its files are anywhere in the path.

                    (1)  DoubleTake   Environmental   Variable.     Use  the
          following command to establish  an environmental variable with the
          DoubleTake path

          SET DT=C:\DOUBLETAKE\

          either from the command  line or in a batch file.   (You can check
          the value of this variable at any time by typing  SET and pressing
          [Enter].)

                    (2)  DoubleTake "Ran-From" location.   In later  version
          of DOS (3.0 and beyond), you  may enter a complete path along with
          the name of a file to execute a file.  DoubleTake  will check this
          spot also for its configuration files.

                    (3)  DoubleTake  Path Search.   DoubleTake will  get the
          Path from  the environment and  search each entry on  the path for
          its files.

               d.   DoubleTake File Viewing Modes.

                    (1)  Two  File  Mode:    This  is  the normal  mode  for
          DoubleTake.  Unless you specifically tell DoubleTake that you wish
          to view only one file (see next paragraph), DoubleTake expects two
          filenames which it will display one above other.

                    (2)  Single  File Mode (also known as  Zoom mode):  This
          allows you to look  at a single file  using the full screen.   You
          can invoke DoubleTake  in the Single File (Zoom)  Mode with the /1
          switch on  the command line or  by pressing [Z]  while viewing two
          files, and choose either [1] or [2] for the desired file to Zoom.

                    (3)  Hex Modes.  Use  [Alt-X] to toggle between the  two
          Hex modes.  

                         (a)  Hex 24-Character Mode.   This mode displays  a
          file in much the same way of DOS's Debug.   You will see a display
          similar  to  the  following.   The  values  on  the  left are  the
          hexadecimal  values  of the  printed values  on  the right.   (The
          Cursor also helps to match values since both the hexadecimal value
          and the printed character are highlighted in this mode.)

                         (b)  Hex 80-Character  Mode.  This mode  displays a
          file  in all  ASCII  characters, 80  columns.   The  value of  the
          character  at the cursor on  the highlighted line  is displayed at
          the corner  of the Window Box.  This mode is useful for displaying
          a wholly ASCII file which has no line ends.

          +[Byte:      5][File 1: TESTFILE.TXT ]===/ /=======[Value: $54]+
          This shows a whole line of ASCII values o/ /nly, with the hex va
          lue of the character at the cursor shown / /in the box corners.
          As you move the cursor, the value above r/ /eflects the current
          character.<cr><lf>                       / /
          |----------------------------------------/ /-------------------|

          NOTE:  The  <cr><lf> represents the printed character for Carriage
          Return  (<cr>, a  single note  character) and  Line Feed  (<lf>, a
          normal video bullet character).

                         (c)  Hex Mode  Cursors.  The cursors in hexadecimal
          mode serve two purposes:   1) Show where the "Find  Next Mismatch"
          and "Find String" functions  begin searching and 2)  highlight and
          identify the hexadecimal value of the character at the cursor.

                              1.   Searching  from  the Cursor.   DoubleTake
          begins searching  from the current  cursor position in  each file.
          When it  reaches  a character  difference between  the two  files,
          DoubleTake stops with the  cursor pointing to the difference.   If
          the difference is a minor one, just move the appropriate cursor to
          re-align the files and  press the "Find Next MisMatch"  key again.
          If  the difference in the files is great,  you may have to use the
          "Find String" function to locate the next point of coincidence.

                              2.   Scrolling  with the  Cursors.    Use  the
          Cursor Left and Cursor Right keys to move the cursor in the files.
          (The [Left] key moves the cursor back toward the beginning of file
          1  while  the [Ctrl-Left]  key moves  the  cursor back  toward the
          beginning  of file 2.  Similarly, [Right] moves the cursor forward
          toward  the end  of file 1  while the  [Ctrl-Right] key  moves the
          cursor  forward toward the end of file  2.)  As you scroll forward
          or  backward in  the  file, the  lines  will automatically  scroll
          forward or backward.   For example, at the beginning  of the file,
          as you move  to the end  of the 80-character  line (byte 79),  the
          next  press of  the  Cursor Right  key will  cause the  display to
          scroll forward to the next  line in the file and the  Byte Counter
          will show 80.  Similarly, if you press Cursor Left, it will scroll
          back to line one, with cursor pointing to byte 79.


               e.   DoubleTake Main Screen Features.

                    (1)  Key  Help  Lines.   On the  last  two lines  of the
          screen, you'll find an  abbreviated list of the keys  available in
          the current  mode.  For more detailed list of keys, press [F1] for







          DOUBLETAKE DOCUMENTATION                                    Page 6

          the Help screen.  There  is a specific key help line  for Two-File
          mode, and for File 1 and File 2 in their Zoomed modes.

                    (2)  File Line Numbers and Byte Counters.  

                         (a)  ASCII Mode.   The  line numbers  represent the
          actual line number of the line in the file you are viewing.  These
          numbers are shown  at the top (or  bottom) of the viewing  window.
          When you find mismatches, you can  make a note of this line number
          to  make it easier to find it when you go into your editor.  Lines
          longer than 80 characters are "wrapped" to the next line.  You can
          tell a continuation line  because it has the  same line number  as
          the first part of the line.  Notice that in Hex Mode, this  is the
          Byte that the cursor is  highlighting.  If there is no  highlight,
          then  the Byte number represents the character at the beginning of
          the Highlight Line.

                         (b)  Hex  Mode.   The  byte counter  for each  file
          keeps  track  of  the  file  pointer.   All  Finds  or  Find  Next
          Mismatches start at this point.  When you move from  line to line,
          the byte pointer  is reset to the beginning of  the line (e.g., 0,
          24, 48, or  0, 80, 160, etc,  depending on the Hex mode).   As you
          move the  cursor in either file  ([Ctl-Left], [Ctl-Right], [Left],
          [Right],  [Shift-Ctrl-Left]  or   [Shift-Ctrl-Right]),  the   byte
          counter will be incremented or decremented to  reflect the current
          file pointer position.  

                    (3)  PrintScreen Indicator.  Note the PrtSc indicator, a
          Paragraph  symbol (the backwards P).   If the  Paragraph symbol is
          highlighted (or ON),  then PrtSc is enabled  (i.e., if  you  press
          [Shift-PrtSc] the  screen will  be printed), if  in normal  video,
          PrtSc is OFF. 

                    (4)  WordStar(tm) Mode Indicator.  The WordStar(tm) Mode
          Indicator indicates WS:[O]n or WS:[O]ff.  The brackets around  the
          "O" mean you may press the [O] key to toggle this mode On or Off.

                    (5)  Display  Special Characters Indicator.  The Display
          Special  Characters   Indicator  displays  a  highlighted  [D]  to
          indicate that Display Special  characters is on, and a  normal [D]
          to  indicate  that Special  Characters  are  to  be  displayed  as
          periods.

                    (6)  Blank Ignore Indicator.  The Blank Ignore Indicator
          (which  is really  a  Character Ignore  Indicator,  since you  can
          specify  which  characters you  wish  to  ignore) will  display  a
          highlighted [B] to indicate that Ignore Blanks is on, and a normal
          [B]  to show that all characters (plus any other characters you've
          chosen  to ignore--See Customize section  to see how  to add other
          Ignore  Characters)   will  be   recognized  while   checking  for
          mismatches or while doing a "Find String."







          DOUBLETAKE DOCUMENTATION                                    Page 7

                    (7)  Various Modes  with no  Specific Indicators.   Some
          modes  are obvious without the need for on-screen indicators.  You
          will know the mode immediately by the look of the screen:

                         (a)  EGA/VGA Mode:   You will be  able to tell  the
          type of  Screen mode you're in  by the appearance of  the files on
          screen.   In  the EGA/VGA  (43/50-line) mode,  you will  see 19/22
          lines  per file in the Two  File Mode and 39/45  lines per file in
          the Single  File Mode.  If you have your EGA/VGA card in the 43/50
          line  mode  when  DoubleTake  is  run,  you  do  not  need  the /4
          switch--DoubleTake will automatically use all 43/50 lines. You may
          only specify 43/50 line mode, however, when entering  the argument
          from the command  line mode, but DoubleTake will find  and use the
          total  number  of lines  available,  for  any  of  the  following:
          25,35,43  or 50.     While  viewing a  file, you  may also  toggle
          between the 43/50 and 25 line modes using the [E]GA/VGA option.

          (Even  if you opt for  normal 25 line  viewing, DoubleTake detects
          the EGA card and sets the Video Speed to Fast.)

                         (b)  Hex/ASCII Mode.   You  will be able  to easily
          determine whether your files are in Hex or ASCII mode.  In the Hex
          mode, you will be able to easily  tell if the file is being viewed
          in 24-Character Mode or 80-Character Mode.

               f.   Loading a file into  DoubleTake.  DoubleTake requires at
          least  one filename.    If you  don't  enter the  filename  on the
          command line, DoubleTake will prompt you  for them.  If you  can't
          remember the filename--don't panic--just press the [F1] key to get
          a complete listing of the files  in the current directory.  If you
          wish to change  directories, just place the highlighted  cursor on
          the desired subdirectory or parent directory and press [Return] to
          move to that directory and see the files. 

                    (1)  Legal  Filenames.    Here  are a  few  rules  about
          entering filenames:

                         (a)  Full Pathname Support:    DoubleTake  supports
          full pathname  designations, (including  period and double  period
          directory  names).    Here   are  the  requirements  for  entering
          filenames:

               - Wildcards for file  2.  Both * and *.* mean  use the File 1
          filename along with any new drive\path entered. For example:

               DT C:\WP\FILE.TYP D:\*     is equivalent to:
               DT C:\WP\FILE.TYP D:\*.*   DoubleTake will try to load:
                    DT C:\WP\FILE.TYP D:\FILE.TYP

               - New Drive or Path.  You may use the File 1 as File 2 with a
          new drive\pathname\ by just entering the drive\pathname\ as File 2
          (which means you never need  to use the * or *.*  mentioned above,







          DOUBLETAKE DOCUMENTATION                                    Page 8

          doesn't it?    Oh, well.).    (See next  note  for the  rules  for
          entering pathnames.)  For example, 
                   
               DT C:\WP\FILE.TYP D:  will Look at FILE.TYP and D:FILE.TYP
               DT  C:\WP\FILE.TYP D:\PATH\ will  looks at C:\WP\FILE.TYP and
                         D:\PATH\FILE.TYP 

               - Paths MUST end in \.  If you  enter a path alone as File 2,
          DoubleTake assumes you mean a filename.
                   
                    (2)  Using  the  Internal  Directory routines.    If the
          filename is not  found or if there is a  problem opening the file,
          you  will get  an error  message and  the chance  to re-enter  the
          correct  filename.   You will  see the  following prompt  for each
          file:

          +================================================================+
          |                                                                |
          |  Enter [Esc] to Exit, [F1] for File List, [F10] to configure,  |
          |                                                                |
          |              or any other key to enter directly . . .          |
          |                                                                |
          +================================================================+

          Press the [Esc] key  to exit DoubleTake and return to DOS.  If you
          wish to see  the files on  the logged drive  and directory,  press
          [F1].   To immediately  go to  the  Configuration Function,  press
          [F10].   To type  in the filename  directly, press any  other key.
          You'll get a 35 character typing area to enter your filename.  (If
          you press a legal character, that character will be entered as the
          first character of the filename.)

               NOTE:   If you intend to use DoubleTake to view only one
               file  and forget the /1 switch on the command line, just
               enter /1 as Filename  Number 2 to enter the  Single File
               mode with just Filename One.

                         (a)  Selecting a  Filename.  If you  press [F1] you
          will see a screen similar to the following:

                * * Disk C: has a volume label of:  MY HARD DSK * *

          You  may change to any directory by placing the highlighted cursor
          on that directory (or  drive name) and pressing the  [Return] key.
          The  filename you  have selected  with the  cursor appears  in the
          lower box and changes as you move the cursor.  If the cursor is on
          a directory, the message in the lower box states:

          |=[ Get File Two ]==[ [V] to View File [PgUp/PgDn: Change Pages]=|
          |  To move to this directory press [<-']:  A:\ Drive <Dir>       |
          +================================================================+

          Pressing [Enter] or [Return] moves to that directory  and displays
          the  files in that  directory.  You  may then move  the cursor and
          select   a  file   from  this   directory  or   move   to  another
          drive/directory. 

                         (b)  Pre-Viewing Files.   If you are  not sure what
          file you wish to compare, I've provided a pre-View option to allow
          you to look before you leap into the compare.  Just put the cursor
          on the file you wish to pre-View and press [V]iew.

                         (c)  Duplicate Filenames.  If the same  filename is
          entered for both File 1 and File 2, DoubleTake will  alert you and
          prompt you for a new file 2.


               g.   DoubleTake Navigation Keys.  Once you have the filenames
          selected, use the following techniques  to move around and compare
          various  lines between  files.  File  1 shows  at the  top of your
          screen and  File 2 shows  at the bottom.   Notice that  long lines
          text are "wrapped" to succeeding lines.

                    (1)  Scroll  Methods.     There  are  two   methods  for
          scrolling  through the  files:   Parallel  Scrolling and  Opposite







          DOUBLETAKE DOCUMENTATION                                   Page 10

          Scrolling.   You can toggle between these  modes at any time while
          you  are viewing the files.  The  compared lines (at the center of
          the screen) can be customized  to unique colors to make them  more
          easily  distinguished from  the  rest  of  the  lines.    See  the
          Customization section for more details. 

                         (a)  Opposite  Scrolling.  Here's  the way Opposite
          scrolling works:

               NOTE:  In this mode you may find it a bit  disconcerting
               dealing  with  the upper  window.     This  file scrolls
               "backwards,"  meaning as you go forward  in the file, it
               appears to move in the opposite direction.  If you don't
               like this problem, try the Parallel Scrolling mode. 

                            +[Line:    1][ File 1 ]==== 
                            This is File 1, line 10.   | 
                            This is File 1, line 9.    |  Scrolling

                         As the  files scroll, they  scroll into and  out of
          the center.   With the  compared lines right above  each other, it
          makes it  really easy to find  differences in the lines.   Use the
          Find  Next Mismatch key to  locate the next  mismatched line, then
          find  out  how  it  differs by  one-on-one  matching.  Notice that
          graphics displays or  boxes will  appear in reverse  order in  the
          upper window.   If this is  annoying, press [S] and  switch to the
          Parallel  Mode  temporarily,  or  Zoom the  file  to  full  screen
          temporarily.

               Notice that the files both scroll in the same  direction
               for Forward and Backward.   This may be easier  for some
               users.  Notice that the  first line of File 1 is  at the
               bottom  of the  window.  The  rest of  File 1  is in the
               proper  order at  the top  of the  box.   This Scrolling
               method  will ensure  any boxes  or graphics  displays in
               File 1 will appear normally.

                    (2)  Key Definitions.  The  definitions of the  function
          keys  are  shown  at  the  bottom  of  the  screen.    To get  the
          definitions of the other keys, use the Help key [F1] or [?].

          Use  the  numeric keypad  (or  optionally, the  Function  keys) to
          scroll  file 1, file 2 or both.   If you get lost, just press [F1]
          or [?] to get a complete key list.

               NOTE:   The keypad keys  are all close  together for all
               functions,  making the  keypad  easier to  use than  the
               function keys.  Both are provided for your convenience.

                              Note:  When you press the Help key, a
                         registered User can get the commercial only

                         listed here are all available from the pop-up
                         menu commands (with the obvious exception of the
                         scrolling keys -- it would not be reasonable to
                         use a 2 or 3 key pop-up menu choice to accomplish
                         what the scroll keys do in one keystroke).  See
                         the Pop-Up Menu section for a detailed
                         description of this menuing system.

           [B]           Blank Ignore toggle.  This toggles whether or not
                         the Find Next Mismatch or Find String routines
                         skip the Ignore Characters selected on each line. 
                         This allows easier compare of files which differ
                         only in the spacing between the words in the two
                         files.  In the Hex Mode, all characters you
                         choose to ignore will be shipped.  Normally, the
                         characters to ignore will be at least the [Blank]
                         and [Tab] characters.  The Configuration section

           [Alt-D]       Exit to DOS.  This option allows you to
                         temporarily jump to DOS to do any tasks you would
                         like and then type the word EXIT and return to
                         the exact place you left in DoubleTake.  This is
                         much faster than Quitting DoubleTake and having
                         to reload the files from scratch.

           [D]           Display special characters toggle.  This toggles
                         between displaying the characters 1-31 and
                         128-255 or displaying a period for all
                         non-standard characters.  This is functional only
                         in Hex Mode.

           [E]           EGA/VGA Mode.  This allows you to toggle the
                         EGA/VGA card between the 25 and 43/50 line modes. 
                         When you press [E], if you have an EGA or VGA
                         card in your computer, you will be automatically
                         toggled to the 43 (or 50) line mode if you are in
                         the 25-line mode.  If you are in the 43 (or 50)
                         line mode, you will be toggled back to the 25
                         line mode.  If you do not have an EGA or VGA
                         adapter, you will here a Bell when you press [E].

                         NOTE:  As expected, this only works on machines
                         which have the EGA or VGA card installed.  There
                         is no check to see if there is an EGA/VGA monitor
                         attached, so you need to take care that you do
                         not shift to a mode which is not supported by
                         your monitor.

                         If you choose [Y], then the string will match any

                         In the HEX Mode, you have the same options,
                         except you must enter either Hexadecimal values
                         (0 to F) or any string.  You MUST enclose the
                         string in either single or double quotations
                         marks, however.  This option allows you to search
                         for single or double quotes by enclosing the text
                         with the opposite type of quote marks (i.e., use
                         double quotes to enclose a string containing an
                         apostrophe, single quotes to enclose a string
                         containing double quotes.

                              You may interrupt the search at any time by
                         pressing any key.

                         is on, the high bit is stripped from each
                         character.   This converts the Horizontal double

                         on.  You can tell the status of PrtSc by the

                              the page.  Although the highlighted
                              line does not move, think of Up/Back as
                              meaning moving the highlighted line to
                              a previous line on the page and
                              Down/Forward as meaning moving the

                              ╒[ Zoom a File ]========================╕
                              |    Zoom which file? <1/2/None> [N]    | 
                              ╘=======================================╛ 

                              Pressing [<-'] or [N] will default to None. 
                         Press [1] to Zoom File 1 and [2] for File 2.   
                              When you have a file Zoomed, all keys for
                         either file will work.  For example, when you
                         have file 1 Zoomed, the normal movement keys,
                         [Home], [End], [Ctl-Home], [Ctl-End], move around
                         the file, as well as the [PgUp], [PgDn], [Ctl-
                         PgUp], [Ctl-PgDn] keys.  This makes it much
                         easier to move around any file, whether in Zoom
                         or Two-File mode.  To help differentiate between
                         files, the filenames and line numbers are in the
                         same location as in the dual window mode.  

                              NOTE:  When you use DoubleTake in the
                              single file mode, you are in the Zoom
                              Mode and the file is considered File 1. 
                              If you use DoubleTake often as a single
                              file view utility, you may wish to
                              reconfigure the highlight colors to
                              match the main window colors.  (The [Z]
                              key is not available in the Single File
                              Mode.)

                         Here's how file 1 looks in Zoom mode:
                                   +[Line:   1][ File 1 ]===========
                         Hilite -> This is File 1, line 1.    ^ 
                                   This is File 1, line 2     | Scrolling 
                                   ////////////////////////   |

                                   This is File 1, line 21.   | 
                                   +================================

                         (File 2 looks the same, except that the Line
                         Number and Filename are on the bottom.)

                         Alignment Keys:  The [Left Arrow]/[Right Arrow]
                         keys are alignment keys which can be used to
                         restore the files to approximately the same
                         location.  If you have been moving forward in
                         only one file, the align keys will allow you to
                         bring the other file up quickly without having to
                         manually walk it forward.  NOTE:  You will be
                         asked to confirm Y/N when you press [LeftArrow].

                              NOTE:  These alignment keys only work
                              forward.  If you try to pull a file
                              back to a previous location, you will
                              get warning tone.  If you need to go
                              back, simply use the Top of File key
                              and start over.

                         In Hex Mode, this key works for any mode (Zoom,

          4.   DoubleTake Configuration Made Easy

               DoubleTake offers you several  customize options to tailor it
          to your personal preferences.  The following are changeable: 

               o  Main and Help Window Foreground and Background colors.
               o  Highlighted line Foreground and Background colors.
               o  WordStar(tm) mode (whether the high bit is stripped).
               o  Highlight method and colors (normal, flashing or reverse)
               o  Type of Monitor card (Slow CGA card (IBM) or Fast card  
                  (almost every other CGA card made)). 
               o  Method of Text Scrolling (Parallel or Reverse).
               o  Method of display (Hex or ASCII)
               o  Width of Hex Display Mode (24 or 80 column mode)
               o  Show ASCII chars 1-31,128-255 or show them as periods.
               o  Ignore or recognize blanks in a compared line.

               a.   Configuration Modifications.  There are two ways to make
          changes   to   DoubleTake's   configuration   file   DUBLTAKE.CNF:
          1) Invoke DoubleTake with any  file(s) and press [C] to  enter the
          configuration  mode  and the  [W]rite the  new  values to  disk or







          DOUBLETAKE DOCUMENTATION                                   Page 23

          2) change  the file  DUBLTAKE.CNF with  an ASCII  editor (such  as
          DOS's  EDLIN.COM, or  Sammy Mitchell's outstanding  Quick Editor--
          QEdit,  for example.)    Here's the  way the  default DUBLTAKE.CNF
          looks:

           7      Main Screen foreground color (0-15)
           0      Main Screen background color (0-7)
           0      Help Screen foreground color (0 to 15)
           7      Help Screen background color (0 to 7)
           0      HiLi Screen foreground color (0 to 31)
           7      HiLi Screen background color (0 to 7)
          False   Non-WordStar(tm) Mode (T/F) (all, even graphics chars)
          ASCII   Ascii Mode to display files (ASCII/Hex)
          80      Characters to Display in Hex Mode (24 or 80)
          True    Ignore blanks (T/F). Ignore Characters on next line.
          09 0A 0C 0D 20 
          True    Display Control Chars/High Graphics chars (Hex mode) (T/F)
          Fast    Fast Video Mode Selected (Slow/Fast)
          R       Reversed Mismatch line Selected (Flashing/Reverse/Normal)
          O       Opposite Scrolling Mode Selected (Parallel/Opposite)
          False   Do not Sound the Bell at all (T/F)

               NOTE:    The  Ignore  Characters line  (line  11  above)
               consists of  hexadecimal values  separated by a  space. 
               Except for this line, all  lines consists of two  parts:
               1) the value in the first column, and 2) the explanation
               in the second column.  All legal values for column 1 are
               shown  at the end of  the explanation line  in column 2.
               If you use  other than  a legal  value, DoubleTake  will
               skip that value and keep its default value.

          Ensure  that you keep  the spacing on  each line identical  to the
          original.  Do not rearrange  the lines or insert blank  lines into
          the file.   If you  do, the file  will not load correctly  and the
          default values will be loaded.  

               Error  Recovery.  Take heart!   Even if  you completely wreck
          the  configuration file,  you can  create a  new one  by following
          these steps:

                    1.   Run DT (alone or with a file)
                    2.   Choose [F10]  Configure from the files  menu (if DT
                         was run  alone) or choose [C]onfiguration  from the
                         main screen, then
                    3.   Change the values to reflect your preferences, and
                    4.   [W]rite out a new copy of DUBLTAKE.CNF.

               b.   Choosing Your Favorite Colors

                    DoubleTake comes  in plain vanilla White  on Black (with
          the help  screen in  exciting Black  on White!!).   This  means it







          DOUBLETAKE DOCUMENTATION                                   Page 24

          should be readable on any screen, whether it's a monochrome, color
          or monochrome monitor on a color card.

               NOTE:  If you are using a monochrome video display  on a
               Color Graphics Adapter, and the display is horrible, you
               might be able  to improve it by  exiting DoubleTake and,
               using the MODE.COM program from you DOS disk, typing:

               A:\>MODE BW80[<-']  ([<-'] is the [Return] or [Enter] key.)

               Now  re-run  DoubleTake  for  a much  more  readable  display
               because DoubleTake checks to  see what type of video  mode in
               effect.

               c.   Configuring DoubleTake Options

                    If  you would  like to  add  a bit  more  pizazz to  the
          program, press [C] to  invoke the Configuration option.   You will
          see the following screen:

          are active while in the Configuration Option:


                Key      Definition
           [F1] or [?]   Get Configuration Help.  This provides help about
                         the Configuration Options and the Exit Options.

           [RightArrow]  If the Main Window is highlighted, this key moves
                         to the Help Window to allow changing the colors
                         for that window.

           [LeftArrow]   If the Help Window is highlighted, this key moves
                         to the Main Window to allow changing the colors
                         for that window.
           [F]           Move to the next color for the foreground.  The
                         colors allowed for the foreground are:

                              0    Black     8    LightGray

           [B]           Move to the next color for the background.  The
                         colors allowed for the background are:

                Key      Definition
           [E]           Toggle between 25 and 43/50 line mode on cards
                         that can shift (EGA or VGA).

           [O]           Change the WordStar(tm) Mode.  This key toggles
                         the WordStar(tm) mode On or Off.  When the
                         WordStar(tm) mode is On, all characters will have
                         their high bits stripped off before they are
                         displayed on the screen.  This mode allows you to
                         read files which contain characters with their
                         high bits set.  If that is a bit of Greek, then
                         here's a quick explanation.  When you create a
                         file with WordStar(tm) in the Document mode,
                         WordStar(tm) uses the last character in each word
                         to control microspacing for justifying the text. 
                         It does this by setting the high bit.  When you
                         display this word on the IBM monitor, you will
                         see the last character as a strange symbol, a
                         greek letter or a graphics character.  If you
                         toggle the WordStar(tm) mode On, this character
                         will once again appear as a normal character.

           [H]           Change The Highlight Mode For Mismatched Lines. 
                         When you press [H], in the Main Screen window,
                         the highlight mode cycles between Flashing,
                         Reversed and Normal.  Use this key, in
                         conjunction with [Ctrl-F] and [Ctrl-B] keys, to
                         get the desired effect on the highlighted lines.

           [C]           Toggle between the 24 and 80 Character Hex
                         Display Modes.
           [V]           Speeding Up The Display On A Fast Color Graphics
                         Adapter.  On many clones, the color card is much
                         faster than the IBM CGA.  Because of this you do
                         not need to wait for retrace to write to VIDEO
                         memory.  To take advantage of your card's faster
                         speed, use the [V]ideo mode key to toggle to the
                         Fast Video mode.  If you see snow when in the
                         Fast mode, you'll need to toggle back to Slow if
                         this snow annoys you.

           [S]           Toggle Scrolling Mode.  Press the [S] key to
                         toggle between the Parallel and Opposite
                         Scrolling Modes.  This option can also be toggled
                         at any point while viewing files and in the
                         Configuration screen.

                         checks for the presence of non-printing
                         characters and shifts to the Hex mode
                         automatically if it detects them.)

           [L]           Toggle Ignore Blanks.  When you're comparing two
                         source files, you are interested in the actual
                         differences between the two files, independent of
                         the spacing.  Press [B] to toggle Ignore Blanks
                         On to disregard all spaces included on each line.

           [F10]         Edit or add to the Ignore characters.  DoubleTake
                         comes configured to ignore Blanks, Tabs, Carriage
                         Returns, Line Feeds and Form Feeds.  You will be
                         allowed to enter new values, but enter them all
                         in Hexadecimal.  Some common values are shown
                         along with a full ASCII chart for reference while
                         entering values.  Use [PgUp] or [PgDn] to move to
                         other pages of the ASCII Chart.
           [P]           Toggle Display of Special characters.  In Hex
                         Mode, you may or may not wish to see the actual
                         value of the character as printed.  You may opt
                         for a less cluttered display by choosing the
                         Display as periods option.  This displays the
                         characters 1-31 and 128-255 as periods.  Toggle
                         again to get the characters back.

           [W]           Write configuration to Disk.  Use this key to
                         save a copy of your choices in the file
                         DublTake.CNF.  When DoubleTake starts again, it
                         will load and set these defaults.  After writing
                         to disk, you will be returned to DoubleTake for
                         more file comparison.

           [Esc]         This exits the configuration option with the
                         current settings, back to DoubleTake.  If this is
                         a temporary change (such as color settings) you
                         may not want to permanently change the defaults. 


          5.   DoubleTake Limitations.

               a.   Duplicate Filenames:  I've  tried to check for duplicate
          filenames entered.   If you have the same file open twice, you may







          DOUBLETAKE DOCUMENTATION                                   Page 28

          get  garbage in  one of  the windows,  especially if  you  get one
          window ahead of the other.  You CAN fool DoubleTake  and enter the
          same filename twice, but why would you want to??!!

               b.   Truncated Lines:    DoubleTake will  truncate any  lines
          longer than 255 characters in the ASCII mode--I hope that is not a
          big  problem.   If  so,  use  the  HEX mode  to  see  ALL  of  the
          characters.   In the Hex  80-character wide mode,  you can compare
          two  ASCII   files  quite  easily.    Use  the  [D]isplay  special
          characters toggle to turn off the strange-looking characters if it
          troubles you.

               c.   File Load Limits in ASCII Mode.  DoubleTake can read any
          size file because it pulls in 300  lines at a time.  When it  gets
          close to the end of the buffer,  it loads another 150.  Because of
          this, after you load  more lines in ASCII mode,  you cannot scroll
          back more than  about 150 lines.  If you need to see the beginning
          of the  file, just press [T]op-Of-File  to go to the  beginning of
          both files.  

               NOTE:   In HEX mode  both files are  fully scrollable in
               both directions!

          6.   Included  Files (Plus  Tutorial).   The  following files  are
          included with DoubleTake:

          DT.EXE         DoubleTake executable file, main program
          DUBLTAKE.CNF   Sample  Configuration  File.    You  may  create  a
                         completely new  file to your tastes  when you first
                         run DoubleTake.
          DUBLTAKE.HLP   The help file  for DoubleTake.  This is  a separate
                         file to keep the size of DT.EXE small.
          DUBLTAKE.ASC   ASCII Chart loaded while entering Ignore characters
          DUBLTAKE.HST   The   history  of  the   revisions  to  DoubleTake,
                         including GoodLook's evolutionary history.
          HIST.BAT       Batch file to read DUBLTAKE.HST with DoubleTake.
          READ.ME        A short introductory file describing DoubleTake.
          README.BAT     Batch file to read DT-READ.ME with DoubleTake.
          DUBLTAKE.DOC   The complete documentation for DoubleTake.
          READDOC.BAT    Batch file to read DUBLTAKE.DOC with DoubleTake.
          TUTOR.BAT      A batch  file running DT which  loads the following
                         files to demonstrate DoubleTake.
          2INDENT.FIL    \__Demo files for practice using DoubleTake's
          4INDENT.FIL    /     numerous features.  See below.

               Demonstration Files for Tutorial and Practice.  Two files are
          included to demonstrate the  features of DoubleTake while allowing
          you to practice  with the various  keys.  The  files are  extracts
          from the introduction of DoubleTake Documentation, with random x's
          distributed  throughout both  files  to have  some differences  to
          find.   Additionally,  file  2Indent.Fil has  two indented  spaces
          while 4Indent.Fil  has four indented spaces  and other differences

          in  spacing to allow you to demonstrate the Blank Ignore features.
          Helpful comments  are included in the  files to prompt you  as you
          find mismatches.   For best  results load "2Indent.Fil"  as File 1
          and "4Indent.Fil"  File 2 as shown following.   (If you simply run
          the batch file TUTOR.BAT, it's automatic!)

          7.   Shareware and Registration. This software is not free.  It is
          marketed  under  the try-before-you-buy  concept  to  allow you  a
          complete  test of the product before you are required to register.
          Although the  unregistered version  shows the commercial  when you
          begin and  end DoubleTake (and every time you ask for help), it is
          not  crippled in any way  -- in fact the addition  of the Hex mode
          and Find String features are major enhancements!
