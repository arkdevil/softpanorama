Installation:

Unzip htmed12.zip and put htmled.exe in a directory somewhere (preferably in it's
own directory).  You can create an icon for it in Program Manager or just run it from
File Manager by double-clicking on it.  Htmled.exe does not require any dll's
or any other files.  It will create HTMLED.INI in the Windows directory.

HTMLED.INI contains only setup options and will be recreated if deleted.  HTMLed
does not create or modify any other files.
