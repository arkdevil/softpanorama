Microsoft SUXX!

The corporate giant is about to revolutionize the way we will look upon 
personal computers: as slow, unreliable tools that accomplish everything in 
twice the time really necessary. And there isn't a single thing you can do 
about it. With questionable business practices, backstabbing tactics and 
plain bad software, Microsoft is about to obtain a monopoly on operating 
systems and popular software on the PC. Apparently, money, power and world 
domination are the only things that matters to Microsoft CEO Bill Gates.

After wasting hundreds of hours of our time with buggy, no-good Microsoft
software, we decided to create this little animation that shows our 
gratitude towards Microsoft. We think the animation is quite cool. We have 
therefore decided to share it with you all.

MS-SUXX is a short multimedia animation that runs for about three seconds.
The animation displays the Microsoft logo, which then gets - no, we don't 
want to spoil it for you. The animation is intended to be run from your 
AUTOEXEC.BAT file or from your WINSTART.BAT file. AUTOEXEC.BAT is (as you 
probably know) a batch file that is executed each time you start/reboot your 
computer. WINSTART.BAT is a batch file that is executed by Microsoft Windows 
when the Windows operating system is started. MS-SUXX can be run in DOS, in a 
DOS session under OS/2 (window or full-screen). Needless to say, the 
animation will NOT run under Microsoft Windows. The animation provides sound 
effects that can be played through a wide array of sound cards. The animation 
can be exited at any time by pressing the ESC-key.

If you install MS-SUXX in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, the animation will appear 
each time you start/reboot your computer. What for, you might ask. Next time 
Microsoft Word crashes (believe us, Word WILL crash), forcing you to reboot, 
you will understand!

Similarly, if you install MS-SUXX in your WINSTART.BAT file, you will be able
to enjoy our small animation every time you have to start Microsoft Windows.

Instructions on how to set up the MS-SUXX animation in your system startup
files is given in the INSTALL.TXT textfile.

We believe that this animation can increase your productivity when working
with computers (especially if you work for a direct competitor of Microsoft).
We are sure that you will agree with us.

This product is freeware, and you are encouraged to spread it like wildfire!
Please keep the archive in its original condition, however. There is no way
to contact us, since we have decided to remain anonymous (Microsoft would sue 
us penniless over this animation if they got the chance).

If you enjoy this product, we kindly ask you to donate $10 or more to a 
charity organization of your choice. If you (god forbid) admire Bill Gates 
and his company, please delete all your copies of this animation and send the 
$10 to Bill Gates instead (he can always use a few dollars more).
