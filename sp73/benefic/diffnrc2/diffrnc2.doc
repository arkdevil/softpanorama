                  a BBS file listing comparison utility

    Diffrnce was written to allow me to compare the files on my bulletin board 
    to those found on others.  This is so I can maintain an upload/download 
    ratio to keep the sysops of the boards happy and my access level high. 

    This document is not intended to be a detailed tutorial on how to use 
    DIFFRNCE.  It will give a moderately knowlegeable person enough clues on 
    how to run it to be able to get by. 

    You must have QSORTL.EXE, BASICA or GWBASIC and MS-DOS to run this 
    program.  If you have GWBASIC, you must change the BASICA line in the 
    DIFFRNC2.BAT file to use GWBASIC.  QSORTL and BASIC must be in a program 
    search path, or be in the same directory in order for this program to 
    work.  Also the two listings to be compared must use the same format for 
    listing filenames (i.e. FILE.EXT or FILE     EXT) in order to work. 

    The two DIFFRNC2 files (.bas and .bat) must be in the same directory as 
    the files to be compared.  If you want to compare multiple files, be sure 
    to rename the file DIFFRNCE.LST so it will not be destroyed. 

    This program is true public domain.  It is not copywrited and can be 
    modified.  I am not asking for a donation.  I do hope that this program 
    will be used extensively and help other telecommunication buffs with their 
    file exchanges.

    Many thanks to Dorothy Strauber for pointing out that many file listings 
    are too large to be sorted with MS-DOS's SORT utility.  Also to Ben Baker 
    for his excellent QSORT program, which seems to be limited only by the 
    size of disk storage.
