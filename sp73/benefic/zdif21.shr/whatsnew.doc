2.1  : ADDED /F option to include special attributes files
       (Hidden and/or System files)
       ADDED the environment variable ZDIFF to set a path where to
       search the unarchivers. (pkunzip.exe, arj.exe, zoo.exe, etc)
       ex : SET ZDIFF=D:\UTIL\ARCTOOLS
       ADDED detection of keyboard while scanning, so when a key is
       pressed, a dialog box appears, waiting for your choice
       (continue or abort)
       ADDED a confirmation dialog before quitting, if a list in memory
       is not saved.
       ADDED : if any difference is found (according to filters options),
       the ERRORLEVEL (DOS exit code) is set to 2. So you can detect this
       in a batch file.
       FIXED the /b (batch) output so that only file names are saved to
       file, so this file can be re-used as input to an other program
       FIXED the color of the message 'No file matching filter'

2.0  : ADDED Turbo Vision visual interface -> much more handy !
       ADDED the /A switch, to use standard output like in version 1.4
       ADDED Colorization of results on screen
       ADDED eXclude filters (act on comparison criteria)
       ADDED Ignore filters (act on dates, size or crc)
       ADDED side-by-side output, for screen and/or file output (option)
       CHANGED sort order - dirs and files are now independant in sort
       DPMI version available separately

1.4  : ADDED the LIST feature. Now you can GENERATE a list from a set
       of files. (using /L)
       Later, you can re-use this list as any other set of files : you
       can use it to compare to another list, directory or archive.
       (use @FileName as the list file name)
       Note : you can also specify a label which will be included in the
       list - use /Lxxxx, where xxxx is your own label.

       Slightly changed the output, to allow more room for pathnames.

       FIXED : if a directory with no file in it, but with
       sub-directories was specified, and wildcards was used, ZDiff
       couldn't use it. This was fixed (in 12/29/93 version).

1.3  : CHANGED the GetDateformat information to use DOS Country accurate
       information only, instead of KEYB country flag.

       ADDED Japan date format in /Cx (override).

       ADDED /B option : Batch output.
       This tells ZDiff to output only the file names.
       You may use it in conjonction with -D (Diffs only)
       to obtain a list of the changed files, re-usable in an other
       program. (archivers...)

       ADDED /M option, Matching files only, to display only the files
       that are both in the NEW and OLD set of files.

       ADDED /Z trouble shooting option, to display technical
       informations while running, like date format used, ZIP format
       detected, and more. Use it if you think that the date format is
       not well detected on your machine, for example. This option
       doesn't appear in the help screen.

       ENFORCED ZIP control : Using PKUNZIP.EXE output, if compress
       ratio is 100%, or files are more than 999999 bytes, then the
       lines scroll on the right. This is now handled in ZDiff.

       ADDED Subdirs warning : Now, if you haven't specified the -R
       option, and an archive involved in the comparison contains
       directory path, a message is displayed to warn you, that NOT all
       the files from the archive were scanned.

       ADDED NoPath option : now, you can compare a ZIP or directory
       that contains subdirs, to a ZIP or directory that doesn't
       contains subdirs. You can then compare a 'built' version of a
       software, where elements are located in subdirs, and the
       development version, where all the elements are stored in the
       same directory. (there are many other applications for this
       option)

       CHANGED the way ZDiff display results in Quick mode, when two
       files have a size or date or time difference, it is marked as
       'Differs' instead of 'Same'. Before, if CRC was not computed,
       files were assumed to be identical, and 'Same' was displayed,
       even if the time or size difference was indicated on the same
       line.


1.2d : DPMI support added. Now, you can scan very large disks, and even
       compare huge CD-ROM disks !

       The maximum number of files you can compare is 16380 with the
       DPMI version, and between 5000 and 9000 with the DOS version
       (approx.).

                            END OF "WHAT's NEW"
