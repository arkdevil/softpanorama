1. Purpose :
------------

        ZDiff is a comparison utility program.

        You can compare a pair of archives, or a pair of directories, or
        an archive and a directory. (that's the new of this !)

        The result is a sorted side-by-side list, showing the status of
        each file. (or pair of files)

        ■ ZDIFF.EXE is the normal DOS version.

        ■ ZDIFFD.EXE is the DPMI hosted version. (if you registered 4 that)
          It permits a larger amount of files to be compared (up to 16380)
          and works with Windows or any other DPMI host. (like Borland's)


2. Syntax :
-----------

  ZDIFF <New Archive/Directory/List> <Old Archive/Directory/List>

        or

  ZDIFF <New Arc/Dir/List> <Old Arc/Dir/List> [options] [wildcards]


        Note : To simplify the following, the archive or directory that
        is compared to an other archive or directory will be called a
        Set of files. There is a NEW set of files, and an OLD set of
        files. (to indicate during the comparison, if files are older or
        newer than other files, for instance).

        The <New archive/directory> and <Old archive/directory>
        parameters are needed (not optional).

        The order in which you specify the New/Old pair is important.
        It will make the difference between a 'Deleted' file or
        'Inserted' file, or a 'Newer' and 'Older', or 'Bigger' and
        'Smaller'. (This will only affect the output result and make
        it simpler for you to read)

        To specify that a set of files is a LIST (not an archive or a
        directory), just add an '@' in front of the LIST filename.
        Like this : ZDIFF @MyList.LST MyNewDir /R
        This way, I compare MYLIST.LST (which is a list), and MYNEWDIR
        (which is a directory)


                The NEW set of files must be specified first.
                ---------------------------------------------

        Then, you may specify wildcards if you need.

        a. Wildcards

        The wildcards may be used to restrict the files compared inside
        the directory or archive. (for both the new and old sets,
        because it would be unlogical to have two different wildcards).
        The DOS standard wildcards are allowed. Note : wildcards are not
        used in LISTs.

        b. Options

        The options may be specified anywhere on the command line, and
        are not case sensitive. The options are :

          /a  :  Automatic mode.
          /as :  Automatic mode, silent.

        By default, once the files have been read, the result of
        comparison is shown in a window, on screen, and you can browse
        through the whole output, using dialogs to specify such things
        as filters, video options, save options, and so on.

        In Automatic mode, ZDiff output the result to standard output,
        and immediatly exits, without any user action.
        This allow the use of ZDiff in batch files.
        Example : You can use 'ZDIFF FILE.ZIP C:\DATA /A >PRN' to
        directly send the result to printer.

        Note : You can also save the result of comparison in a file,
        from the user interface : use File|Save.

        The form /As tells Zdiff to not display any file information
        while working. ('s' stands for 'Silent')

          /b  :  Batch output.

        Only the file names are saved. (no diff info)
        Use this option to select a set of files (the Newer files,
        for instance) and to save the resulting list.
        You may re-use this list as input with an other program.
        (to update an archive with new files, or delete files that are
        already in an archive or on a backup disk, for example)

          /c  :  Country flag override.

        If the dates for the ZIP files are not well recognized, you may
        use this option to force the date format to use while reading
        ZIP files :

            /C0 - USA date format.       (MM/DD/YY)
            /C1 - EUROPEAN date format.  (DD/MM/YY)
            /C2 - JAPANESE date format.  (YY/MM/DD)

          /d  :  Differences only.

        Once the two sets of files are compared, the output will only
        show the files that are different between the 2 sets. (ANY
        difference : date, size, crc, name...)
        By default, all the files of the two sets are displayed.
        This is equivalent to /X= (Exclude Equals)

          /f   :  Files atributes

        The default is to scan only normal files - but you can, with
        this option, tell ZDiff to scan Hidden files and/or System
        files.
        Example : ZDiff NEW.ZIP C:\OLDDIR /FHS
        /FHS tells ZDIff to scan Hidden (H) and System (S) files.

          /h   :  Help !

        This display help screens, and an information screen.

          /i   :  Ignore Filter

        You can ignore the differences matching certain criterias.
        These criteria must immediately follow the /i switch.
        The letters that can be used are (in any order) :

            c - Ignore the CRC differences.
            d - Ignore Date differences.
            s - Ignore Size differences.

        An example : ZDIFF NEWFILE.ARJ C:\DATA /id
        The output will ignore date difference in comparisons.
        (/id = Ignore Date differences)

          /l   :  Generate a list.

        With this option turned on, you don't compare two sets of files,
        you just generate a list from ONE set of files, that can later
        be used to compare with... an other listing, or an other set of
        files. This allows you to gain a lot of time if you want to
        compare one set of files with several sets of files. (ZDiff,
        when using a list, don't have to scan a disk for names, sizes,
        dates, and CRC so it's incredibly FAST !)
        When you generate a list, ZDiff try to obtain the maximum
        informations from the source files.

        You can specify a label name for the list, which will be
        included in the output file. This is for information only.
        If you don't specify any label, the default label will be the
        volume label if the source is a directory, the archive name if
        it's an archive, or the first label of the list if it's a
        previously saved list.

        If the source is a directory, both 16-bit and 32-bit CRC are
        calculated and displayed in the output list. This allows you to
        later either compare with a 16-bit CRC archiver output, or a
        32-bit CRC one. If the source is an archive, only the CRC used
        by the unarchiver output can be obtained and sent to the list
        output. As usual, the display is sent to standard output, so to
        save the list, just re-direct it, like this :

                        ZDIFF EXAMPLES /L >EXAMPLES.LST
                    or  ZDIFF MYSAMPLES.ARJ /L >SAMPLSET.1
                    or  ZDIFF /LMyLabel DUMM.ZOO >DIR1.LST

        The first example outputs a list from the EXAMPLES directory,
        calculating both 16 and 32-bit CRC, to EXAMPLES.LST.
        The second example outputs a list of the files contained in
        MYSAMPLES.ARJ - the CRC is 32-bit, since ARJ use 32-bit CRC.
        The third example outputs a list from DUMM.ZOO, which use the
        16-bit CRC. "MyLabel" will be the label of this list.

        Several lists can be concatenated to form a list of lists.
        These big lists are treated like a single list when used in
        ZDiff. Example :

                        ZDIFF DISK1 /L > MASTER.LST
                        ZDIFF DISK2 /L >> MASTER.LST
                        ZDIFF DISK3 /L >> MASTER.LST
                        ZDIFF @MASTER.LST OLDMAST.ZOO

        In this example, MASTER.LST contains the information of the files
        from the DISK1, DISK2 and DISK3 directories. This information is
        then compared to the ZOO archive called OLDMAST.ZOO.

          /m   :  Matching files only.

        The output will only show the files that are BOTH in the NEW and
        the OLD set of files. Files that are only in the NEW set or only
        in the OLD set (i.e., Deleted or Inserted files) will not be
        shown. Useful if you want to compare a set which is only a
        subset of the other.
        This is equivalent to /Xid (eXclude Inserted and Deleted)

          /n   :  No Path in names

        With this option, you can compare a full directory tree with a
        single directory. Useful to compare a ZIP file that have a
        directory tree stored inside of it, and a directory that
        contains all the files without subdirectories.
        Note : use this option with caution, since the path is barely
        stripped from each name. If two files have the same name in
        two different directories, the latest files updates the data
        from the previous one.

        Example : to compare two directories, one containing the 'cut'
        product, and one containing the 'development' version, like :

           New directory : BUILD\*.*

           Old directory : CUT\DISK1\*.*
                           CUT\DISK2\*.*
                           CUT\DISK3\*.*         etc...

        You can compare these 2 directories with the following command :

           ZDIFF /r /n BUILD CUT

          /p   :  Pause.

        With this option, ZDiff will prompt you before reading each set
        of file. The purpose of this is essentially while using
        floppies, or removeable media.
        For example, if you need to compare two sets that are on two
        different floppies that have the same format, you'll have to
        insert one disk, read the files from it, and then the second
        disk. Maybe, you could compare 2 removable hard disks, or a hard
        disk and an archive, or whatever you want.

          /q   :  Quick scan.

        If a directory is involved in comparison, this permits to skip
        the CRC calculation on each file of this directory, in order to
        speed up the process. Of course, use this option with caution,
        since the comparison is then only made with TimeStamp and Size !
        (two files can have the same date and time of last modification,
        the same size, and be binary different : using this option, they
        will be marked as 'Same'). However, if the timestamp or size is
        different, 'Differs' will be displayed.

          /r   :  Recurse directories.

        By default, the subdirectories are not searched, either in the
        archive or the directory file structure. (to save time). This
        switch allows the comparison of the full tree of directories.
        Note : if you don't specify the -r option, the filenames that
        contains a path in the archives are not treated at all. A
        warning is displayed if a path is found in an archive, if you
        have not used the -r option.

          /v    :  Verbose output.

        This option causes a status to be output at the end of comparison.
        This status report shows the number of files that are :

                - Identical
                - Different
                - Newer
                - Older
                - Bigger
                - Smaller
                - Inserted
                - Deleted

        It gives a quick idea of the amount of differences between the
        two sets, without having to analyze the whole output.

          /x    :  eXclude filter.

        You can exclude from output the files that match a certain
        criteria. These criteria must immediatly follow the /X switch.
        The letters that can be used are (in any order) :

           i - exclude Inserted files.
           d - exclude Deleted files.
           n - exclude Newer files.
           o - exclude Older files.
           b - exclude Bigger files.
           s - exclude Smaller files.
           c - exclude CRC different files.
           = - exclude Identical files.

        An example :
          ZDIFF NEWFILE.ZIP C:\DATA /Xo=
          Exclude from output the files that are Equals, and the Older
          files, too.

          /z    :  Zpecial messages. (troubleshooting option)

        Troubleshooting mode option - display more information while
        running, like Country code detected, date used, Zip version...
        It may help if something seems to go wrong (with date format
        detection, for example). Please note that using the DPMI version
        of ZDiff with the Borland RTM DPMI server, the Country Code
        number MAY be inaccurate. However this doesn't affect the DATE
        FORMAT detection. (See the /C option to override the Date format
        detection).
        The same information can be obtained in the user interface,
        using the shortcut Alt+Z.


3. Using the user interface
---------------------------
        Once all the files have been read in memory, the output is
        shown in a scrolling window, on screen, with colors that show
        where the differences are.
        Each color have a signification. Use Alt-L (or /Help|Legend in
        the menu) to obtain the reference (legend) of colors.

        - White on blue represent 'No difference'.
        - White on Red represent 'CRC difference'.
        - White on Magenta represent 'Date newer' or 'Size bigger'.
        - White on Cyan represent 'Date older' or 'Size smaller'.
        - Yellow on blue represent 'Inserted' files.
        - Red on blue represent 'Deleted' files.

        Here are the menu options :

        File|Save : Saves the output to a text file, either
        Side-by-side or Single column (See Options|Misc)
        If /L specified on command line, it saves the file as a list.
        otherwise, it saves a diff file.
        ShortCut : F2.

        File|Exit : Quits ZDiff, back to DOS.
        ShortCut : Alt+X.

        Options|Filters : show a dialog box to let you specify the
        different filtering options, (Exclude and Ignore) and where
        these filters apply (to screen only, or Saved file also).
        These options match by default the command line options,
        if you have specified some.
        ShortCut : Alt+T.

        Options|Misc : at this time, you can only specify how you want
        the saved file output to be. (single or side-by-side)

        Options|Toggle video : toggle between 25 and 43/50 lines screen.
        ShortCut : Alt+V.

        Options|Toggle directory : toggle between side-by-side output
        (the directory information is still shown on the extreme right,
        just scroll to the right to see it), and Single column output
        (the names and directories fit on the screen)
        ShortCut : Alt+D.

        Help|Arguments : brings a serie of dialogs explaining the use
        of ZDiff. (equivalent to /H on the command line).

        Help|Legend : brings a dialog explaining the meaning of each
        color.
        ShortCut : Alt+L.

        Help|Status : display a global status of the comparison.
        ShortCut : Alt+S.

        Help|Register : information for registration of ZDiff.
        ShortCut : Esc.

        Help|About : Version information, and registration information.
        ShortCut : F1.


4. Features :
-------------
        Since this is a comparison program, you will probably want to know
        how it compares the two sets of files :

        The keys of comparison are :

Name :  If two names of the sets don't match, either one is new or one is
        deleted, depending on the order you specified for the comparison.
        if the -r option is specified, the full filename must match.

        Once two files are found in both the 2 sets, a more precise
        comparison occurs. The keys for comparison between two files that
        have the same name are :

CRC  :  The most accurate CRC method is used to know if files are absolutely
        identical or not.
        CRC is either taken from the archive, or calculated from the files
        in the case of a directory. 32-bit CRC is the default.
        Note : if one of the sets is an archive of type LZH, LHA, ARC or
        ZOO, then a 16-bit calculation is done on files, to match the CRC
        that these archives use.
        -> If you compare one archive which use 16-bit CRC and an other
        which use 32-bit CRC, then they can't match : the Quick mode is
        then automatically set to ON. (CRC are not compared). In this
        case, the only way to compare these archives with a CRC is to
        extract one of them to a directory, and then compare this
        directory to the unextracted archive.

        If the Quick option is set, and at least one of the 2 sets is a
        directory, no CRC calculation occurs, and files are assumed binary
        identical.

Date :  To know which one is the oldest file, or the newest.
        (Time is used, too)

Size :  To know which one is the biggest file, or the smallest.


5. How it works
---------------
        To compare two directories, or a directory and a saved list, or
        two lists, you won't need nothing but ZDIFF.EXE.
        But to compare two archives, or an archive and a directory,
        you'll need the correct unarchiver in your PATH, to access the
        archives you have specified.
        NOTE : New in version 2.1, the unarchivers path can be specified
        in the DOS environment variable ZDIFF. So you don't have to
        add a directory path to your long PATH statement.

        Example : SET ZDIFF=D:\TOOLS\ARCTOOLS
        (tells ZDiff that PKUNZIP, ZOO, ARJ, etc - are in the directory
        called D:\TOOLS\ARCTOOLS)

        The program supports all the current archive formats that are
        commonly used and that I am aware of :

                ZIP, ARJ, LHA, LZH, PAK, ZOO, ARC.

        The needed unarchiver, for each extension is :

                *.ZIP     PKUNZIP.EXE   (v1.10 or v2.04+)

                *.ARJ     ARJ.EXE       (v2.30)

                *.LHA \
                *.LZH  -  LHA.EXE       (v2.12)
                *.PAK /

                *.ZOO     ZOO.EXE       (v2.1)

                *.ARC     PKUNPAK.EXE   (v3.61)

        (each of these can be easily found on many BBS or Compuserve)

        Now, here is how ZDiff works :
        The program first checks if the archive or directory or list
        that you specified exists. (to prevent an error after some
        precious seconds of calculation). At this point, it decides if a
        32-bit or 16-bit calculation will occur (or no crc, if Quick
        mode is set). Then, it analyzes the NEW set, and then the OLD
        set.

        Three choices, concerning each set of file :

        a. If it's an archive:

        The unarchiver is called, to obtain a list of each file in the
        archive, along with the date, crc, size, and so on.
        This list is saved in a temporary file.
        (Using the TEMP environment variable if available)
        Then, the temporary file is opened, and scanned for each file in
        it. Since all the informations are already calculated by the
        unarchiver, there's nothing to compute (the crc is already
        there).

        Each file entry is then compared or stored to a list in memory.

        b. If it's a directory:

        The directory is scanned, and all the files are opened, to
        obtain their date, time, size, and a CRC calculation occurs.
        (except if the Quick mode is set). Each file entry is then
        treated like archive files entries.

        c. If it's a list:

        The list is opened, and scanned like an archiver output. The
        only difference is that since BOTH the 16 and 32 bits CRC can be
        presents, the CRC choosen is the one that correspond the best to
        the other set of file to compare to. (the most accurate is
        always taken) Each file entry is then treated like archives file
        entries.


        After all the files have been read in memory (the NEW set and
        the OLD set of files), the sorted list is sent to standard
        output. Since you can redirect standard output, you could use
        this facility to pipe the output to a finder program (FIND,
        GREP), or a viewer program (VIEW, LIST), or any filter program
        of your choice.

        If any difference is found, in the set of files selected by the
        filters, the ERRORLEVEL (or DOS exit code) is set to 2.
        You can then test this in a batch file, if you use ZDiff as an
        automated process.


        Here are some examples :

        1.  ZDIFF NEWARC.ZIP OLDARC.ARJ

            This compares the 2 archives, and display the result on
            screen.
            (if the archive contains sub-dirs, they are not included,
            since no -r parameter is there - instead, you'll obtain a
            warning while running ZDiff).

        2.  ZDIFF /A /R NEWARC.ARJ C:\TEMP\OLDDIR >DIFF.TXT

            This compares the new archive NEWARC.ARJ to the current
            directory C:\TEMP\OLDDIR, the subdirectories are scanned (/R)
            and the result is redirected to standard output (/A) so that
            DIFF.TXT contains the printable result of comparison.

        3.  ZDIFF /r NEWARC.ZIP OLDDIR *.DOC /XIDO

            This displays all the NEW files (/XIDO excludes Inserted,
            Deleted and Older files) in NEWARC.ZIP, compared to
            the OLDDIR directory files.
            Subdirectories are scanned, too. Only the .DOC files are
            processed.

        4.  ZDIFF NEWZIP.EXE . -r -q -c1 /1zip

            This displays the differences between the archive
            NEWZIP.EXE (/1zip tells ZDiff that it's a ZIP archive) and
            the current directory. The subdirectories are scanned, too,
            (-r) both in the archive and the directory.
            A Quick scan (-q) of directories files will be made (no
            CRC), so the comparison will be based on date, time and size
            only. The date format used by PKUNZIP on this machine
            is the EUROPEAN date format (-c1 means DD/MM/YY date format).

        5.  ZDIFF . -r OLDARC.LHA /d /q -m

            This displays the differences between the current
            directory and the archive OLDARC.LHA. Subdirs (-r) are
            scanned also. Only the differences are shown (/d), and no CRC
            is calculated (/q). Only the matching files (-m) of the two
            sets are displayed.

        6.  ZDIFF -A -L \BIN >MASTER.LST

            This outputs in MASTER.LST the list of files in the \BIN
            directory, along with their date, time, 16-bit and 32-bit
            CRC, and size. For later comparison purpose.
            (using then @MASTER.LST as one of two sets)
            /A tells ZDiff to redirect the output to standard output.

        7.  ZDIFF LATEST.ZIP @MASTER.LST -d
            This displays the differences between the latest product zipped
            in LATEST.ZIP, and the master list generated by the previous
            example.


6. Requirements :
----------------
      ZDiff is compiled for 80286 and above systems.

      DOS version : a minimum of 300kb is required.

      You need a color adapter, if you want to browse the results on
      screen. (otherwise you can still output to an ASCII file with /A).

      DPMI version : 2MB or more memory would be good.
      You need a DPMI host, of course. (Windows, for instance).

      Optional : a mouse !


7. Limits :
-----------

      ■ ZDIFF.EXE :
        All the files informations are stored in DOS memory. (no EMS) It
        allows between about 5500 to 9900 files to be stored, depending
        on the path lengths and your available system memory - this is
        much enough for everyday personal/business use, I guess.

      ■ ZDIFFD.EXE :
        All the files informations are stored in the GLOBAL memory.
        (DPMI) So, you can virtually store as many files that you have
        memory free, up to 16380 files at one time in memory.
        You need Windows or any other DPMI host, like Borland's DOS RTM.
        Note : Borland DOS DPMI host can be found on Compuserve : GO
        BORFORUMS, then go to 'Borland Pascal forum'. Then, choose the
        'From Borland' library section, and download the file called
        NEWRTM.ZIP. If you register for the DPMI version, I send you the
        latest RTM.

      ■ Note concerning the archives : if the -r option is not
        specified, the files containing a path in their name are not
        included in the comparison. Only the files in the main directory
        of the archive are scanned, and only the files in the specified
        directory are scanned also.
        However, a warning is displayed if a directory path is found in
        an archive, and if you haven't specified the -r option.

      ■ Note concerning the LISTS generated by ZDiff : wildcards are not
        used at all while reading a saved list. All files that are in a
        list are read, even if you specifed a wildcard on the command line.
        -> But you can use wildcards to generate a list.


8. Remarks
----------
        I made my possible to make this program free of bugs, but if
        ever something is wrong with ZDIFF, tell me. I'll fix it ASAP.

        ZDiff is written in Pascal and Assembly, compiled using
        Borland Pascal 7.01, (for DOS and DPMI targets), with
        Turbo Vision 2.0.

        Please note that ZDiff supports international information from
        DOS, since PKUNZIP does. (it concerns the date format, used for
        date comparison, that is different in US and in France, for
        instance). The DOS Country information is read for this purpose.
        The 3 date formats that exists are USA, European and Japanese.
        If ever the comparison of dates seems to be wrong in ZDiff, you
        can override (with the /C option) the automatic detection to set
        a date format to use on your machine. See the 'Syntax' section.

        Note : if you use the /Z option to display technical
        information, the country information reported by ZDIFFD.EXE (the
        DPMI hosted version) may be inaccurate, if you use the Borland
        DPMI RTM ; The date format, however, will be correctly detected
        and used.
        The correct country number will be correctly obtained, running
        ZDIFFD under Windows DPMI. Note : The country number is for
        information only. Don't worry if it's wrong. Just check that the
        date format displayed match your PKUNZIP outputs.

        Since ZDiff writes a few temporary data on your hard disk (in
        your temp directory), you should not reboot while ZDiff is
        running, as this could result in lost sectors. (CHKDSK /F would
        corrects it anyway) Just press a key if you want to abort the
        program - a dialog box will ask you if you want to exit or
        continue.

11. Registration / author
-------------------------
        If you like this program, and plan to use it, you may try it
        during a 21 days period, after what you should register.

        I make many tools for my own professionnal use, (this one
        helps me a lot!) and it would be very pleasant to me, to know
        that these tools are useful for someone else, too !

        If you register, I'll understand that my tools are useful :
        in this case, I'll spend more time to update them, and adding
        features - according to your requests or suggestions.

        The registration fee is $15 for a single user. (cash, please)
        (by the way - are you french? if yes then go to section 12 below).
        For $5 more, I'll send you ZDIFFD.EXE, which is the DPMI hosted
        version of ZDiff; it allows you to compare much more files.

        For multi-user registration, please look at the REGISTER.DOC
        form included in the ZDiff package. I made this registration
        form for your convenience ; you can print it, fill-in the blank
        fields, and send it to me along with your bank note(s), or check.

        Please note that a US check cost $30 to me, so don't send a
        check for less than $100 (I live in France).

        The unregistered version of ZDiff is limited to a certain
        amount of files... Much enough to work and have a good idea of
        its possibilities. Please register to override this (small!)
        limitation.

        Thanks for using ZDiff, I hope it helps.          //ChD


12. You are french ?  read this
-------------------------------
        Vous êtes français ? très bien. L'objet de cette section est de
        vous inviter à vous enregistrer avec de la monnaie un peu plus
        pratique que le dollar. J'ai fixé le prix minimum de ZDiff à 80FF,
        plus 30FF pour la version DPMI.
        En ce qui concerne les enregistrements pour plusieurs utilisateurs,
        veuillez utiliser le fichier REGISTER.DOC, et multiplier le prix en
        dollars par 5.8.

        Pour les inconditionnels du français, je compte faire une version
        entièrement en français - mais pas immédiatement, car ça prend un
        certain temps de passer tous les messages en ressources, pour les
        traduire facilement. De plus, je n'ai reçu pour l'instant que deux
        demande d'enregistrement provenant de francophones... ZDiff se vend
        pour l'instant bien mieux à l'étranger !

        Merci d'utiliser ZDiff, et n'hésitez pas à le conseiller à vos amis
        si vous l'appréciez. N'hésitez pas non plus à m'envoyer du courrier
        en français !
