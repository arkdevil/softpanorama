        SHEZ is a shell program to make viewing and working with archive files
        user friendly.  It provides the user with a friendly, consistent
        interface for all supported compressed file operations.
                              ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS NEEDED


        You will need, at a minimum, at least one file compression program,
        and optionally a file browser program.  Vern Buerg's LIST program is
        an excellent, full featured file browser program, and has been
        thoroughly tested with SHEZ.  You will also need one of the file
        compression programs supported by SHEZ.  These include PKZIP, PAK,
|       ARJ, LZH or LHA, PKPAK, ZOO, SQZ, UC2, and RAR.  When installing these
        required programs, be sure to install them into a directory that is in
        your path statement.  If you are installing the PKZIP package be sure
        to install the following three programs:  PKZIP.EXE, PKUNZIP.EXE, and
        ZIP2EXE.EXE.


        All of the programs mentioned in this section, with the exception of
        Central Point Software Virus Scan, can be found on most Bulletin
        Boards, and on Cserve.  They are all available on the Directory
        Assistance BBS that is mentioned at the end of this document.

        PKZIP, PKUNZIP by Phil Katz for ZIP files.
        PKUNPAK, PKPAK by Phil Katz for ARC files.
        LHARC, LHA by Haruyasu Yoshizaki for LZH files.
        ZOO by Rahul Dhesi for ZOO files.
        PAK by NoGate Consulting for PAK files.

        If you want to use the virus scan option of SHEZ you will also need
        the virus scan program by McAfee Associates called SCAN.EXE.  The SCAN
        program from McAfee Associates has been extensively tested with SHEZ
        and is highly recommended.  This program can be found on most major
        BBS's or you may obtain it by calling the McAfee BBS. You must obtain
        version 39 or greater of this program in order for SHEZ to use it
        correctly.

                                      QUICK START

        Installing SHEZ is a very straight forward procedure, simply copy or
        extract from the compressed file, all the .EXE, .COM, and the SHEZ.HLP
        files into a directory that is defined in your DOS PATH.  Optionally
        you may create a new directory to hold the SHEZ files.  If you choose
        this option you must either add the new directory name to your DOS
        PATH, or ALWAYS start SHEZ from the new directory.

        After installing the files run the SHEZ configuration program. At the
        DOS prompt type in SHEZCFG and press the enter key.  The configuration
        program is menu driven with full help screen available for each
        option.

        THE SHEZCFG PROGRAM MUST BE USED TO CREATE AN EXTERNAL CONFIGURATION
        FILE.  SHEZ WILL NOT RUN WITHOUT A CONFIGURATION FILE!!!!!

        To start-up SHEZ simply enter "SHEZ [d:\path\filespec]".  You may
        specify wild cards in the filespec. If you use wild cards in the
        filespec SHEZ will present you with a scrollable list of files that it
        found matching the filespec. SHEZ recognizes the special
        filename.fileext of $.$.  If you specify a filespec of $.$ SHEZ will
        list only the files having an extension of .ARC, .ZIP, .LZH, .ARJ,
|       .ZOO, .SQZ, RAR, and .UC2 or the files having extension matching the
        extensions that where set using the configuration program. SHEZ will
        also recognize just the $ file extension along with a DOS wildcard
        filename. For example if you start SHEZ by entering SHEZ C:\UTY\P*.$
        SHEZ will display a list of files that have a filename beginning with
        the letter P and that have a file extension of
|       .ARC,.ZIP,.LZH,.ZOO,.PAK,.ARJ.SQZ.RAR,UC2, or what ever you set the
        extensions to using the config. program.

        You may also start SHEZ and specify a sub-directory name of the
        directory you are currently in.  For example, if you are currently in
        the C:\UTILITY directory and you want to work on the files in the
        C:\UTILITY\PGMS directory start SHEZ by entering the following: SHEZ
        PGMS\

        Also included in the file list will be any directories that SHEZ
        found.  The directory names will be enclosed in greater than and less
        than symbols. I.E. <DIR1>.  You can position the highlight bar on a
        directory name and press the enter key to view the files and
        directories that are contained in that directory.  To move up one
        level in the directory tree highlight the directory entry that appears
        as <..>.  As you change directories the full disk:\pathname will be
        displayed on the main screen.  In addition the disk:\path that will
        receive extracted files is also displayed on the main screen. You can
        than choose the file you wish to work on by moving the highlight bar
        with the cursor keys and pressing the enter key. SHEZ will then
        present you with a screen showing the contents of the archive file.

        To perform a function, simply position the highlight bar and press the
        key(s) that corresponds to the function you want to perform on that
        member.  Pressing the F1 key will open a window giving you context
        sensitive help.

        SHEZ also has a built-in menuing system. To activate the menu system
        press the forward slash key.  A menu bar will appear at the top of the
        screen. Using the left and right cursor keys you may select major menu


                                   SHEZ USER MANUAL                Page -7-

        item. Press the enter key to view the choices under the menu item.
        Using the up and down cursor keys you may choose an action item and
        then press the enter key to perform that item.  Pressing the ESC key
        will take you back one level.  Keep pressing the ESC key to exit the
|       menu system.  The menu system can also be navigated using the
|       highlighted "HOT KEYS".  The hot keys will appear in reverse video
|       colors.  The top menu bar will have the hot key highlighted.  The drop
|       down menus hot keys will also be highlighted and will appear on the
|       left side of the drop down menu box.  Below is an example of the menu
|       display.  On the top menu bar the hot keys appear as capital letters
|       or numbers.

        There are two functions that can only be activated via the menuing
        system. Printing a file contained in an archive file, and setting the
        default compressing factor.  There are no hot keys associated with
        these functions.

        SHEZ will optionally swap 90% of its code out of memory when you:

        1)   Shell to DOS
        2)   Execute the edit function.
        3)   Run a program contained in a compressed file.

        This allows you to run most programs from within SHEZ without running
        out of memory.  The default for SHEZ is not to use this swapping
        function.  However this can be changed via the configuration program.
        The swapping function will swap as much of SHEZ as possible out of DOS
        memory and into either EMS (3.2 or 4.0), XMS memory, if available, or
        to the currently active default disk.

        PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU ARE RUNNING A SYSTEM WITHOUT A HARD DISK OR
        WITHOUT EMS or XMS MEMORY DO NOT ACTIVATE THIS OPTION.

                                 COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

        The command line format when starting SHEZ is as follows:

             SHEZ [filespec] [/Exxx] [/PLAY=xxx] [/LCD] [/Cfilespec] [/4]

        Please note all command line options are optional.  You may enter a
        filespec pattern for SHEZ to use when searching for a file. All legal
        DOS wild card specifies are allowed, as are Drive and Directory
        information.
        In addition relative pathnames may also be entered on the command
        line.
        For example:
             SHEZ C:\UTY\*.ZIP
             This will startup SHEZ and will only list the files on the C:
        drive in the UTY directory that have a file extension of .ZIP.

             SHEZ ..\DATA\*.*
             This will startup SHEZ and will list the files one directory back
             from the \DATA directory.


        The /E parameter tells SHEZ to set its default extract location to the
        Drive and directory specified immediately following the /E parameter.
        DO NOT ENTER A SPACE AFTER THE /E parameter.
        I.E. /EC:\WORK   This specifies an extract location of the E: drive
        and the WORK directory.
        If you start SHEZ with this parameter it will over-ride all other
        default extract location.  Once SHEZ is started you may alter the
        extract location by using the ALT-P command.

        The /LCD parameter tells SHEZ you are running SHEZ on an LCD display
        monitor.  SHEZ will adjust its screen color set to make the display
        more readable on LCD displays.

        The /PLAY= parameter tells SHEZ to load the previously saved macro
        file and playback the recorded keystrokes immediately upon startup. If
        the macro file does not exist, SHEZ will ignore the request.

        Example:  SHEZ C:\UTY\*.ZIP /PLAY=C:\DATA\MY.MAC

        This will start SHEZ looking in the C:\UTY directory for all files
        with an extension of .ZIP and will playback the recorded keystrokes
        contained in the file C:\DATA\MY.MAC.

        For more information on keystroke recording and playback see the
        section KEYSTROKE RECORDING/PLAYBACK FACILITY on page 42 later in this
        document.

        The /C parameter allows you to specify the location of the SHEZ
        configuration file on the command line.  The filespec immediately
        following the /c will be used as the configuration file.  This will
        over-ride the SHEZCFG environment variable if it has been specified.

        The /4 parameter allows you to activate the 4DOS description display
        via the command line.

                                     MOUSE SUPPORT

        Shez offers full mouse support in any of it's supported screen modes.
        When mouse support is active a mouse action bar will appear on the
        last line of the display.

        LEFT-MOUSE-BUTTON

             Pressing or releasing the left mouse button on one of the action
             items will perform the action as described below. If there is a
             Yes under the REPEATABLE column, this indicates that the action
             will repeat as long as the left mouse button is held down.  All
             the actions shown on the action bar are active anywhere within
             SHEZ.

        NAVIGATING A SCROLLABLE DIALOGUE BOX USING THE MOUSE

             When a scrollable dialogue box appears the mouse cursor can be
             positioned on the scroll bars, or within the dialogue box to
             perform the following actions:

             1)   Scroll the box up and down.
             2)   Scroll the box right and left.
             3)   Move the highlight bar to an item.
             4)   Tag an individual item.

             The sample screen display below shows the areas of a scrollable
        dialogue box where the LEFT mouse button performs an action.

                            ACTIVATING THE QUICK MOUSE MENU

        In addition to the normal menu system, SHEZ also contains a QUICK
        MOUSE MENU SYSTEM.  This menu system contains a few frequently used
        commands that can be accessed quickly.  There are three ways to
        activate the QUICK MOUSE MENU:
             1)   To display the MOUSE MENU, position the mouse cursor on the
                  [MM] item on the mouse action bar at the bottom of the
                  screen.  Press and release the left mouse button and the
                  MOUSE MENU will appear.
             2)   Press and hold the right mouse button, then press and hold
                  the left mouse button, then release both bottons.
             3)   If you have a three button mouse press and release the
                  middle mouse button.

        One of two mouse menu's will appear depending upon where you are in
        SHEZ.  If the DOS directory window in displayed the first menu will
        appear,  if you are looking at the contents of a compressed file the
        second menu will appear.

                    USING THE MOUSE WITH VERN BUERG'S LIST PROGRAM.

        I have had numerous questions on how to allow the mouse to function
        when viewing a file via Vern's list program.  In order to allow the
        mouse to function within list you must "CLONE" the mouse option into
        the list program.  You must be using LIST PLUS version 7.2 in order to
        use the mouse.  To clone the mouse option change to the directory that
        contains the LIST.COM program, then start the LIST program from the
        DOS prompt and include the mouse command line option /M.  I.E. LIST
        /M. When the first screen appears press ALT-C to modify LIST.COM to
        always startup with the mouse option.  If you need further information
        on cloning the list program please see the documentation included with
        LIST.


                                 INTERNAL QUICK-VIEWER

        Shez also contains it's own internal file browser called QUICKVIEW.
        QUICKVIEW has full mouse support and will allow you to view any size
        file using a minimum of memory.  While it is not substitute for a full
        featured browsing program such as Vern Buerg's LIST program, it is
        very fast and allows you to view any file in ASCII or HEX modes.  If
        you don't have an external browsing program QUICKVIEW will allow you
        to use SHEZ as it was intended.


                                EDITING KEY DEFINITIONS


        When you are prompted to enter information the following editing keys
        can be used:

        Home:          Go to beginning of input line.
        End:      Go to end of input line.
        Backspace:     Go back one character and delete.
        CTL-END:  Erase to end of line.
        Cursor Right:  Move right one character.
        Cursor Left:   Move left one character.
        ESC:      Cancel input.

              FUNCTION SUPPORTED WHEN A DOS DIRECTORY WINDOW IS DISPLAYED

        DOS directory Speed Search
             When the DOS directory window is displayed you may quickly
             position the highlight bar to a directory or file by pressing a
             single letter or number.  Pressing an UPPER CASE A-Z or 0-9 will
             be position you to the first directory that begins with the
             pressed letter or number.  Pressing the same letter or number
             again will position the highlight bar to the next matching entry.
             If no entry begins with the entered letter or number the
             highlight bar will not be moved.

             Pressing an lower case a-z or 0-9 will be position you to the
             FILES that begins with the pressed letter or number.

        Extract location - ALT-P
        This option will prompt you to enter a drive and directory of where to
        place files that you extract from the archive.  This location will
        remain in effect until you enter the ALT-P command again and clear the
        drive and directory or you change to another archive file. This
        command is used when you want to place extracted files in a location
        other than the current drive and directory.

             If you specify a directory that does not exist a
             ERROR/INFORMATION window will appear indicating that the
             directory does not exist.  You may press the F10 key to create
             the directory.

             This command may be issued at any time.

             When the input window appears pressing the F9 key will open
             another window which will display a scrollable list of
             directories. To display a list of directories other than on the
             current drive, enter the drive letter followed by a colon, then
             press the F9 key.  Scroll the list using the up and down cursor
             keys, and press the ENTER key to select the directory you wish to
             extract files into.

        Create a new archive file - F7

             This will display a help screen showing all currently supported
             commands.  Any command can be entered while the help screen is
             displayed.

        Temporary exit to DOS - F10
             This will temporarily clear the screen and exit to DOS. You can
             then execute and command you want.  To return to SHEZ type in

             This will temporarily clear the screen and exit to DOS into the
             currently defined extract directory. You can then execute and
             command you want.  To return to SHEZ type in EXIT at the DOS

             prompt and press return. (Not available when running under
|            DESQVIEW)

        Select a new archive file - F2
             This option will prompt you to enter a new disk, directory, and
             filespec to find another archive file to work with.
             If you enter a filespec of $.$ SHEZ will only list directory
             entries and file that have extensions of .ARC, .ZIP, .LZH, PAK,
|            ARJ, ZOO, SQZ, RAR, and UC2.

             When the input window appears pressing the F9 key will open
             another window which will display a scrollable list of
             directories. To display a list of directories other than on the
             current drive, enter the drive letter followed by a colon, then
             press the F9 key.  Scroll the list using the up and down cursor
             keys, and press the ENTER key to select the directory you wish to
             change to.

        View a file - F3
             This option will allow you to view any file that is listed in the
             main file window.  Simply highlight the file you wish to view by
             using the cursor keys then press the F3 key.  The list program
             will be invoked allowing you to view the contents of the file.
             (ALSO SEE CTL-ENTER FOR ALTERNATE FILE VIEWERS)

        Delete a DOS file or empty directory - F4
             This option allows you to delete the file that is currently
             highlighted in the file window.  Please note will be asked if you
             want to delete the file. Respond Y if you wish to delete the
             file, anything else will abort the delete. The deleted file name
             will not be removed from the displayed list. Instead it will be
             flagged with an # to the left of the filename and a 'd' to the
             right.
             If the highlighted entry is a directory, SHEZ will remove the
             directory only if there are no files or sub-directories under
             this directory.

        Sort the file list - F9
             This option will sort the file list that appears on the left side
             of the screen. You will be asked if you want the list sorted by
             filename, file extension, file date,  file size, tagged status,
             or unsorted. When sorting by filename any directory found will
             also be sorted. When sorting by extension, date, or size the
             directories will be sorted at the top of the list.  When sorting
             by date the file time is also included in the sort.
             A dialog box will also appear asking you if you wish to sort in
             Ascending or Descending order.

        Convert highlighted file - ALT-V
             This option will convert the highlighted file to another archive
             method.  A list will appear showing the available compression
             alternatives that SHEZ has been configured for.  Using the mouse
             or cursor keys highlight the compression method you wish to
             convert to, then press the enter key. You may also press the ESC
             key to cancel the conversion process.   The converted file will
             be placed into the same directory as the original file, and the
             original file will remain intact.  When a compressed file also
             has directory information stored along with the filenames, and
             the file is being converted to a compression method that supports
             pathnames, SHEZ will retain the directory information.  In
             addition, if the compressed files being converted has volume
             label information stored, SHEZ will attempt to retain the volume
             label information. (PLEASE NOTE: THE VOLUME LABEL PROCESSING WILL
             ONLY WORK IF YOU ARE CONVERTING FROM A ZIP OR ARJ FILE FORMAT TO
             A ZIP OR ARJ FILE FORMAT.  ALSO THE VOLUME LABEL PROCESSING WILL
             NOT FUNCTION WHEN RUNNING SHEZ IN THE DOS BOX UNDER OS/2.)

        Convert all tagged files - CTL-V
             This option will convert all tagged files to another archive
             method. A list will appear showing the available compression
             alternatives that SHEZ has been configured for.  Using the mouse
             or cursor keys highlight the compression method you wish to
             convert to, then press the enter key. You may also press the ESC
             key to cancel the conversion process.   The converted file will
             be placed into the same directory as the original file, and the
             original file will remain intact.

        Convert highlighted file to a SFX file - F8
             This option will convert the highlighted compressed file into a
             Self extracting file.
             (Currently only files in the ZIP,LZH, and PAK formats may be
             converted)

             If you are converting a ZIP file that was created using version
             1.1 of PKZIP, SHEZ will first attempt to create a MINI Self
             extracting file. If that fails than a normal Self extracting file
             will be created. See the PKZIP documentation for more on MINI
             self extracting files.

                              NOTES ON CREATING SFX FILES

        To convert a ZIP file to self extracting file the program,
        ZIP2EXE.EXE, must be in the current directory or in a directory that
        is defined in your PATH.

        When a PAK file is converted the PAK file is replaced by the self
        extracting file.  For example:  If tell SHEZ to convert a file named
        TEST.PAK in the directory C:\TEST the TEST.PAK file will be deleted
        from the C:\TEST directory and will be replaced by the file TEST.EXE.
        This is not a function of SHEZ it is a function of the PAK compression
        program.

        When an LZH file is converted to a self extracting file the LHARC
        program will created either a .COM file or a .EXE file, depending on
        the size of the LZH file.

        Convert Tagged files to SFX files - SFT-F8
             This option will convert all tagged compressed files into Self
             extracting files.  See the F8 option above for additional
             information on creating SFX files.
        Write out configuration information - ALT-W
             This option will write out a file named SHEZ.CFG. This file will
             contain the current SHEZ configuration options.  This file can
             then be used as your default configuration file.  This file
             should be copied to a directory that is named in your path
             statement.

        Copy highlighted file CTL-F2
                 This option allows you to copy the highlighted file.  When
        prompted for
                 the location to copy to you may enter the target directory
        name along
                 with an optional filename and extension.  If the filename and
        extension
                 are not supplied SHEZ will use the original filename and
        extension.
                 You may also use the * wildcard character for either the
        filename
                 and/or the extension.  If you use the * character SHEZ will
        use the
                 original filename and/or extension when copying the file.
                 I.E. From: = C:\UTILITY\ANY.ZIP
                        To: = C:\WORK\NEW.*

                 This will create a file named NEW.ZIP in the \WORK directory.

                 The new file will have the original file's time and date
        stamp.

        Move highlighted file CTL-F3
             This option allows you to move the highlighted file.   When
             prompted for the location to move to you may enter the target
             directory name along with an optional filename and extension.  If
             the filename and extension are not supplied SHEZ will use the
             original filename and extension.
             The moved file name will not be removed from the displayed list.
             Instead it will be flagged with an # to the left of the filename
             and a 'm' to the right.
             If you move a file from one directory to another directory on the
             same drive, SHEZ will simply modify the file pointers instead of
             performing a copy and delete function.

        Rename highlighted file CTL-F6
             This option allows you to rename the highlighted file.  You must
             at least provide a filename and extension.

        Toggle the Tag status - SPACE
             Pressing the space bar will toggle the tagged status of the
             currently highlighted file. A check mark to the left of the
             filename indicates that it is tagged.

             As files are tagged and untagged a count of the number of files
             tagged along with the total size of all tagged files is updated
             on the main screen.

        Tag All Files - CTL-SPACE or CTL-T
             This option will tag all files

        Untag all Files - CTL-U
             This option will untag all tagged files.

        Add/Update compressed file comments - ALT-C
             This option allows you to add/update the file comment records in
             all tagged compressed files.  To use this option first create an
             ASCII file that contains the file comments you wish to add to the
             compressed files.  Then tag the files you wish to update, and
             press the ALT-C keys.  You will be prompted for the ASCII file
             that contains your comment record(s). SHEZ will then execute the
             appropriate compressed file maintenance program to add/update the
             file comments in each tagged compressed file.

        Immediate Exit ALT-Q
             This option will immediately exit SHEZ.

        Test tagged compressed file(s) for viruses - ALT-Z
             Using this option SHEZ interfaces with the virus scan program
             (SCAN.EXE) that is produced by McAfee Associates.  You must have
             version 39 or greater of this scan program in order for SHEZ to
             use it correctly.

             First tag all the compressed files in the directory window that
             you wish to test.  Then press the ALT-Z keys, or use the drop
             down menus.  SHEZ will extract all .COM, .EXE, and .OV? files
             into its working directory for each tagged compressed file, and
             will execute the virus scan program to determine if any of the
             program files have been infected. If an infected program is found
             SHEZ will temporarily suspend its processing allowing you to see
             which programs are infected.  You may then press any key to
             continue scanning the rest of the tagged files.  (See the
             configuration section of this manual for more information on
             configuring SHEZ for this option).

             If there are any nested compressed files, SHEZ will also search
             the nested compressed files for .COM, .EXE, and .OV? files for
             viruses.  The nesting level search is limited only by the amount
             of free disk space in the work drive assigned to SHEZ.

        Test for viruses and strip comments out of .ZIP files - CTL-Z
             This option perform exactly the same function as the ALT-Z
             command, with the added feature of stripping the master comment
             record out of any .ZIP files that are scanned.

             HPLASER II-IV 2up print
                  This will print the tagged or currently highlighted file in
                  landscape mode, two logical pages per physical page.  NOTE:
                  Thie print function will only operate on LASER printers that
                  support the HP LASER PCL 4 printer control codes.  IT WILL
                  NOT OPERATE CORRECTLY ON A HPLASER IIP.
             HPLASER II-IV land/bar
                  This will print the tagged or highlighted files in

        Smart copy - ALT-F2
             Pressing the ALT-F2 keys will activate the smart copy function.
             The smart copy function performs the same function as the COPY
             TAGGED function with the additional feature of optimially filling
             the target drive.  SHEZ will scan the tagged file list and will
             select combinations of files to maximally fill the target drive.
             If all files will not fit on the target drive, SHEZ will untag
             the files that it could copy leaving the files that could not be
             copied tagged.

             Pressing the ALT-F8 keys will UUENCODE the tagged or highlighted
             file(s).  If no files are tagged then only the highlighted file
             will be UUENCODED.  Before UUENCODING the file(s) a dialog box
             will appear prompting you for the disk and directory of where to
             place the UUENCODED files.  The ENCODED files will have the same
             filenames as the orginial file(s) with a file extension of .UUE.

        UUDECODE - CTL-F8
             Pressing the CTL-F8 keys will UUDECODE the tagged or highlighted
             file(s).  If no files are tagged then only the highlighted file
             will be DECODED.  Before DECODING takes place a dialog box will
             appear prompting you for the disk and directory of where to place
             the DECODED files.  The DECODED files that are created will have
             the same name as when they were orginially encoded.

        DISK-FREE-SPACE - CTL-F
             Pressing the CTL-F keys will display a dialog box in the upper
             right corner of the screen which will show the amount of free
             space on the current default drive.  The cursor will be

             Pressing the ALT-F3 keys will activate the smart move function.
             The smart move function performs the same function as the MOVE
             TAGGED function with the additional feature of optimially filling
             the target drive.  SHEZ will scan the tagged file list and will
             select combinations of files to maximally fill the target drive.
             If all files will not fit on the target drive, SHEZ will untag
             the files that it could move leaving the files that could not be
             moved tagged.

|       Extract all - ALT-X
|            The ALT-X keys will extract all files from the highlighted or all
|            tagged files.  If files are tagged the user will be asked if they
|            want to perform the function on the highlighted file or on the
|            tagged files.  The user will also be prompted at the beginning of
|            the operation for the extract location.  During this extraction
|            operation the Overwrite and restore directory options are always

                   FUNCTIONS WHEN VIEWING CONTENTS OF ARCHIVE FILE:

        Viewing a file - V
             Simply press the return key or the V key. This will temporarily
             unpack the file and will invoke the LIST program allowing you to
             view the file on your screen.  The temporary copy of the
             extracted file will be placed in the current disk and directory
             unless you specified a work disk to be used by using the
             configuration program.

        SHEZ will allow you to operate on compressed files that are contained
        within compressed files.  I.E. A zip file that contains zip files.  To
        view the contents of the embedded compressed file simply move the
        highlight bar to the compressed file and press the ENTER key.  The
        embedded compress file contents will now be displayed on the screen.
        You may view any of the files and/or extract any of the files
        contained in the compressed file.  However you may not add, delete, or
        update the embedded compressed file.

        Extracting a single file - E.
             This will extract the file that is being pointed to.  The
             extracted file will be placed on the current disk in the current
             directory. You may optionally use the ALT-P command to direct the
             extracted files to a different disk and/or directory.

        Testing archive integrity - T
             This will test the integrity of the archive file and will report
             the results on the screen.

        Display Info about archive file - I
             This will display information about the archive file in a small
             pop-up window at the top of the screen.  The information will
             include the number of files in the archive, the date of the
             newest file in the archive,  the total size of all the files in
             the archive including the total expanded size and total
             compressed size. It will also display the current default
             compression factor.

        Delete a file from the archive - D
             This will delete the selected file from the archive file. Before
             the file is deleted a prompt will appear asking for verification
             of the delete. In addition any files that were previously tagged
             will have the tag cleared.

        Delete a tagged files from an archive - CTL-D
             This command will deleted all tagged files from the archive file.
             Before the files are deleted a prompt will appear asking for
             verification of the delete operation.


                                   SHEZ USER MANUAL               Page -28-

        Add file(s) to archive     - A
        Update files(s) in archive - U
        Move files(s) to archive   - M
        Freshen file(s) in archive - F
             Each of these options will cause a small window to open at the
             bottom of the screen.  The window will prompt you to enter one or
             more file specifications. These filespecs can include drive,
             path, and a filespec with wild cards.  All files matching the
             indicated filespec will be added, updated, moved or freshened in
             the current archive file depending on which option you initially
             picked. Any files that were previously tagged will have the tag
             cleared.

             For example if you enter a U to update files in the archive and
             you enter c:\source\*.c  d:\batch\*.c when prompted to enter a
             filespec, than all files on the C drive in the source directory
             that have a file extension of C, and all files on the D drive in
             the batch directory that have an extension of bat, will be
             updated in the current archive file.

        List of files to add to archive     - ALT-A
        List of files to freshen in archive - ALT-F
        List of files to move to archive    - ALT-M
        List of files to update in archive  - ALT-U
             Again each of these options will cause a small window to open at
             the bottom of the screen.  The window will prompt you to enter a
             filespec.  This filespec can include drive, path, and a filespec
             with wild cards.  When you press the return key another window
             will pop-up on the left side of the screen showing you all the
             files that were found that matched the filespec you entered. You
             can then use the cursor keys to scroll the file list.  Pressing
             the space bar will toggle the tagged status of the current
             highlighted file. When you are done tagging file press the return
             key and all files that you tagged will be added, freshened,
             moved, or updated in the current archive file. END GROUP

        Specify where to put extracted files - ALT-P
             This options will prompt you to enter a drive and directory of
             where to place files that you extract from the archive.  This
             location will remain in effect until you enter the ALT-P command
             again and clear the drive and directory or you change to another
             archive file. This command is used when you want to place
             extracted files in a location other than the current drive and
             directory.

             If you specify a directory that does not exist a
             ERROR/INFORMATION window will appear indicating that the
             directory does not exist.  You may press the F10 key to create
             the directory.

             This command may be issued at any time.

             When the input window appears pressing the F9 key will open
             another window which will display a scrollable list of
             directories. To display a list of directories other than on the
             current drive, enter the drive letter followed by a colon, then
             press the F9 key.  Scroll the list using the up and down cursor
             keys, and press the ENTER key to select the directory you wish to
             extract files into.

        Extract all files from archive - ALT-X
             This command will extract all files from the archive file and
             place them in the current disk:\directory unless you specified a
             different extract location by using the ALT-P command.

        Delete all extracted files - ALT-D
             This command will delete all files in the current
             disk:\directory, or the one specified by the ALT-P command, that
             are also contained in the archive file.  The files will only be
             deleted if the file time and date are equal to or less then the
             file time and date of the same file that is contained in the
             compressed file. NOTE: it does not delete anything from the
             archive file.  This is useful when you extract file from the
             archive file and then you want to quickly delete all the
             extracted files.

        Execute a file in an archive file - R
             This command will execute the EXE or COM file that is currently
             highlighted on the archive file list.  The EXE or COM file will
             be extracted from the archive file and will be placed on the
             current disk in the current directory. You will then be prompted
             to enter any optional command line parameters that the program is
             expecting. The selected program will then be executed.  After the
             program is run the extracted file will be deleted. NOTE: You can
             specify a different disk drive to place the extracted file on by
             using the SHEZFG program.  This is useful when working with
             archive files that are on floppy disks.  If you specify disk C as
             the work disk in the SHEZFG program the extracted file will be
             placed on the C drive, will be executed from the C drive, and
             then will be deleted from the C drive.

        Speed search - ALT-S
             This option will allow you to quickly find a file in an archive.
             A window will pop-up asking you to enter a match pattern.  This
             pattern follows the standard DOS wildcard specifications. The
             list of files on the screen will then be scrolled to the first
             file that matches the pattern.  Pressing ALT-S again and pressing
             the ENTER key will position the highlight bar to the next file
             that matches the pattern.

        Immediate Exit - ALT-Q
             This option will immediately exit SHEZ.

        Extract all tagged files - CTL-E
             This option will extract all files that you tagged in the archive
             file.  To tag a file simply press the space bar to toggle the
             tagged status.  When a file is tagged it will be highlighted on
             the screen.

        Toggle the Tag status - SPACE
             Pressing the space bar will toggle the tagged status of the
             currently highlighted file. A check mark to the left of the
             filename indicates that it is tagged.

        Untag all tagged files - CTL-U
             This option will untag all files that you previously tagged.

        Tag All Files - CTL-SPACE
             This option will tag all files


                                   SHEZ USER MANUAL               Page -30-

        Update the archive files time and date - CTL-T
             This option will change the archive file's time and date to match
             the time and date of the newest file in the archive file.

        Create a new archive file - F7
             This option allows you to create a new compressed file.  For
             further information see the section titled, CREATING NEW
             COMPRESSED FILES on page 45.

        Show help screen - F1
             This will display a help screen showing all currently supported
             commands.  Any command can be entered while the help screen is
             displayed.

        Temporary exit to DOS - F10
             This will temporarily clear the screen and exit to DOS. You can
             then execute and command you want.  To return to SHEZ type in
             EXIT at the DOS prompt and press return. (Not available when
             running under DESQVIEW)

        Temporary exit to DOS into Extract Directory - ALT-F10
             This will temporarily clear the screen and exit to DOS into the
             currently defined extract directory. You can then execute and
             command you want.  To return to SHEZ type in EXIT at the DOS
             prompt and press return. (Not available when running under
             DESQVIEW)

        Select a new archive file - F2
             This option will prompt you to enter a new disk, directory, and
             filespec to find another archive file to work with.
             If you enter a filespec of $.$ SHEZ will only list directory
             entries and file that have extensions of .ARC, .ZIP, .LZH, .PAK,
|            ARJ, ZOO, SQZ. RAR, and UC2.

        Sort the archive file list - F9
             This option will allow you to sort the archive file list by Name,
             Extension, Date, Size, or Path name.  A small window will open up
             asking you how you want the list sorted.  Enter a N, E, D, S, or
             P.  When sorting by Path name the files will be soted by name
             within pathname.  A dialog box will also appear asking if you
             want to sort in Ascending or Descending order.

        Edit the selected file - F8
             This option will extract the selected file onto either the
             default disk or the work disk specified via the configuration
             program.  It will then invoke the editor specified via the
             configuration program passing the selected filename.ext to the
             editor.  When you exit your editor SHEZ will then MOVE the
             extracted file back into the archive, if it has been modified,
             and delete the extracted copy. If an editor was not specified
             during the configuration process this command will not function.
             If the compressed file is a .ZIP file and authenticity mode in
             toggled on when the edited file is saved back into the compressed
             file the authenticity mode will be honored.  If the file being
             edited has directory information stored with the filename, SHEZ
             will retain the directory information even when saving the file
             back into the compressed file.

        Specify an archive file mask - Z
             This option allows you to display only the files in the archive
             that match the file mask.  The file mask uses the same wild card
             conventions as DOS.

        Toggle overwrite mode - O
             This option toggle overwrite mode on and off.  When overwrite
             mode is in effect an 'O' will appear in the upper right hand
             corner of the screen.  When overwrite mode is in effect, and you
             extract a file from an archive, it will be extracted even if it
             already exists on the target disk:\path.

        Add Update File Comments - ALT-C
             This option allows you to add and/or update the compressed file
             comments.

        Supply Password for File - G
             This option allows you to supply a password when working with
             password encrypted files.  The password will be used when
             extracting, viewing, and modifying the currently selected
             compressed file. When a password has been supplied the compressed
             file display window will indicate that a password is in effect.

        Set Path/Directory option - P
             If a file has been saved into a compressed file with a directory
             name the name will appear on the right side of the compressed
             file list.

             Normally when you update or extract files from a compressed file
             the directory information is ignored.  Using the 'P' option you
             can tell SHEZ that you want to save and/or use the directory
             information.  When you press the 'P' key a list of three options
             will appear on the screen.  The first option "Do not use Dir
             info", tells SHEZ to ignore directory information.  The second
             option "Use Dir Info" tells SHEZ to save the directory
             information when updating a compressed file, or to use the
             directory information when extracting files.  The third option,
             "Use Dir Info and Recurse", tells SHEZ to save directory
             information when updating a compressed file and to recurse down
             the directory tree when looking for files. The third option also
             tells SHEZ to use the directory information when extracting
             files.

             The selected option will remain in effect until you specifically
             reset it using the P command again.
             The following options are passed to the compression programs when
             directory information is to be used:

             USE DIR INFO             USE DIR INFO AND RECURSE
             Pkzip -P            Pkzip -Pr
             Pkunzip -d               Pkunzip -d
             Lharc /x            Lharc /x /r
             Lharc /x (when extracting)    Lharc /x (when extracting)

             Please consult the compression program's documentation for
             further information on what these options do.

        Convert SFX file - CTL-V
             This option will convert a self extracting compressed file (.COM
             or .EXE) back to a normal compressed file.  The normal compressed
             file will be placed on the same disk and in the same directory
             when the self extracting is located.  The self extracting file
             will remain intact.  Please note that this option is only
             available when you are viewing the contents of a self extracting
             file. For a list of the self extracting file that can be read my
             SHEZ see the section titled SELF EXTRACTING FILE SUPPORT on page
             47.

        Test COM,EXE, and OVL files in a compressed file for viruses -ALT-Z
             Using this option SHEZ interfaces with the virus scan program
             (SCAN.EXE) that is produced by McAfee Associates.  You must have
             version 39 or greater of this scan program in order for SHEZ to
             use it.  When you press the ALT-Z key SHEZ will extract all .COM,
             .EXE, and .OV? files into its working directory and will execute
             the virus scan program to determine if any of the program files
             have been infected. (See the configuration section of this manual
             for more information on configuring SHEZ for this option).
             Beginning with release 6.5 of SHEZ you may now tag the files you
             wish to check for viruses before pressing the ALT-Z keys.  When
             files are tagged, only the tagged files will be checked.

        Extract only newer files - ALT-N
             The ALT-N command will only extract files contained in the
             compressed file that are newer than the files that are contained
             in the extract directory.
             If no files are TAGGED ALT-N will extract all newer files that
             are contained in the compressed file into the extract directory.
             If there are files tagged, only the newer tagged files will be
             extracted.

        Alternate file viewers - CTL-ENTER
             Pressing the CTL-ENTER command will allow you to view the
             currently highlighted file using a user specified alternate file
             viewer.

             working with is a ZIP file it will also show you the size of the
             ZIP file that will be created if you build a new ZIP files
             containing all of the tagged files.  Please note this is only an
             estimate and does not take into account file comment records and
             it assumes that the compression method will be the same as is
             currently used.

        Toggle authenticity mode in PKZIP - ALT-1

        a formatted listing of the contents of the compressed file.  If this
        item is selected a drop down dialog box will appear allowing you to
        print to LPT1, LPT2, or LPT3.

        Also under the CONVERT menu option the following menu item will
        appear:

        CONVERT TO ANOTHER FORMAT

        This option allows you to convert the compressed file you are
        currently viewing to a different type of compressed file.

                                 VOLUME LABEL SUPPORT


        Shez now supports adding and extracting volume label information
        to/form compressed files.  Volume label processing is only supported
        for ZIP and ARJ type compressed files.

        ADDING VOLUME LABELS WHEN CREATING NEW COMPRESSED FILES:

        When creating a new ZIP or ARJ file via the F7 key, you will be asked
        if you wish to store volume label information.  If you respond Y, you
        will then be asked to enter the Drive Letter of the drive to obtain
        the volume label information from.  Enter the drive letter (A-Z).
        Please note: these prompts will only appear if you are creating a ZIP
        or ARJ compressed file.

        ADDING VOLUME LABELS TO AN EXISTING ZIP OR ARJ FILE:

        To add volume label information to a pre-existing ZIP or ARJ file,
        first open the compressed file by moving the highlight bar to the
        appropriate file.  Then press the enter key. This will open the
        compressed file. Then press the $ key (SHIFT 4).  You will be asked to
        enter the drive letter to obtain the volume label information from.
        Enter the drive letter (A-Z).  The volume label from the specified
        drive, if any exists, will be added to the compressed file.

        EXTRACTING VOLUME LABEL INFORMATION:

        To extract volume label information from an existing compressed file,
        press the ALT-4 key to turn on automatic volume label processing.
        When automatic volume label processing is active a $ will appear next
        to the NAME field heading in the compressed file listing, or will
        appear in the upper left corner of the DOS directory display window.

        After activating automatic label processing, open the appropriate
        compressed file as documented above.  Set the extract location using
        the ALT-P (extract path) command. Then extract any or all files from
        the compressed file.  During the extraction process the volume label
        contained in the compressed file will be used to update the volume
        label information on the extract drive.

        PLEASE NOTE: ONCE YOU TURN AUTOMATIC VOLUME LABEL PROCESSING ON, IT
        WILL REMAIN ON UNTIL YOU TURN IT OFF BY USING THE ALT-4 KEY AGAIN.
        PLEASE USE THIS OPTION WITH CARE.

                               FLOATING EXTRACT LOCATION

        SHEZ now supports a concept called the floating extract location.  The
        feature was added due to numerous user requests, and is an option
        feature which is activated via the SHEZCFG program.  Normally when
        SHEZ is executed SHEZ sets the file extract location to the current
        disk and directory.  When you change to a different disk and/or
        directory the extract location remains constant, pointing to the disk
        and directory where SHEZ was started from.  To change the extract
        location you needed to use the ALT-P command (change extract
        location).

        The floating extract location basically allows the extract location to
        float as you change to a new disk and/or directory.  The extract


                                   SHEZ USER MANUAL               Page -41-

        location will float to what ever disk and directory you are currently
        looking at.  You can still dynamically specify an extract location by
        using the ALT-P command, but when the ALT-P command is issued the
        floating extract option will be de-activated from that point on.  You
        can reactivate the floating extract location logic by pressing the
        ALT-P keys and entering a single asterick at the prompt.

        To activate the floating extract location option, use the SHEZCFG
        program and choose the ADDITIONAL SETUP INFORMATION menu item.  When
        the SHEZCFG program prompt you for a default extract location, enter a
        single asterisk.  The single asterisk tells SHEZ to activate its
        floating extract logic.

                                  Ultravision Support

        SHEZ is Ultravision "aware".  SHEZ will operate in an Ultravision
        screen mode as long at the number of columns equals 80, and the number
        of rows are between 25-50. If SHEZ determines that Ultravision is
        installed, and it active in an non-supported screen mode, SHEZ will
        deactivate Ultravision, and then will set the screen mode to one of
        the supported modes.  When SHEZ is exited, it will re-activate
        Ultravision and put the screen mode back into the Ultravision mode is
        was in before SHEZ was started.

                                  FORMATTING FLOPPIES

        SHEZ has the ability to format a floppy disk in either the A: or B:
        drives.  The following disk capacities are supported:
        5 1/4 drives: 360KB and 1.2OK,  3 1/2 drives: 720KB and 1.44KB.
        To format a disk press the ALT-O keys and a dialogue box will appear.
        Enter the drive letter you wish to format, the capacity to format, and
        if you wish each track verified during the format process.  The verify
        process will increase the time it takes to format a disk.  If you are
        using high quality disks you can opt to not verify to speed up the
        format process.  After the disk is formatted you will have the option
        of adding a volume label to the disk.  If no volume label is wanted
        simply press the ENTER key without entering any information.

        If your PC is an "XT" class machine, the format dialog box will ask
        you the type of disk drive you are formatting in.  Enter the code that
        corresponds to the type of floppy drive you have installed.

        Formatting error codes can be found in the Apendix of this manual.

                         KEYSTROKE RECORDING/PLAYBACK FACILITY

        Shez now has the built in ability to record, playback, load, and save
        key stokes.  All of the keystroke recording abilities must be
        activated from the keyboard. They can not be activated via the mouse
        or the pull-down menus.  A menu item for MACROS do appear on the menu
        bar, but it is only used to access the help panel for keystroke
        recording. If you are using a mouse the functions performed by the
        mouse WILL NOT BE RECORDED.  Only keystrokes entered directly from the
        keyboard will be recorded. During keystroke recording, the ALT-Q (QUIT
        SHEZ) key will be recorded, but will not be acted upon.  This will
        allow the user to record and save the ALT-Q key into the playback
        macro.

        The keyboard HOT-KEYS and there functions are explained below:

        ALT-5     Macro record/playback PAUSE

             The ALT-5 key is used to PAUSE the record/playback macro function
             to allow the user to respond to a dialogue box prompt.  When
             recording a macro and a dialogue box opens, press the ALT-5 key,
             then enter the response to the dialogue box.  The macro recording
             will resume as soon as the user presses the ESC, ENTER, or
             Function keys.

             When playing back a macro that has been recorded using the PAUSE
             feature, the macro will PAUSE at the same location where the ALT-
             5 key was originally pressed, allowing the user to enter data
             into a dialogue box prompt.

             For example: If you were recording a macro to search for a string
             of characters in a group of files and you wanted to input a
             different search string each time you executed the macro, you
             would:

             1)   Start the macro recording by pressing the ALT-6 key.
             2)   Open up the compressed file you wish to search.
             3)   Tag the files you what to scan through.
             4)   Press the ALT-G key to pop-up the search data entry box, as
                  shown below:

             7)   After the search is done press the ALT-6 key again to stop
                  macro recording.
             8)   Press the ALT-9 key to save your macro.

             Now when you playback the macro, when the search data entry box
             appears the macro will pause allowing you to alter the search
             string before processing the rest of the recorded macro.

             When the macro facility is in PAUSE mode, the ESC key, ENTER key,
             or any FUNCTION key will resume the execution of the macro.

        ALT-6     Start/Stop recording keystrokes.

             Pressing the ALT-6 keys will toggle the keyboard recording mode.
             When SHEZ is recording keystrokes the speaker will blip after
             every keystroke is pressed.  Pressing ALT-6 again will stop the
             keystrokes from being recorded. Up to 500 keystrokes may be
             recorded.

        ALT-7     Immediately play back the recorded keystrokes.

             Pressing the ALT-7 key will immediately playback your recorded
             keystrokes.

        CTL-Q     Cancel recording/playback and flush the keystroke record
                  buffer.

             Press the CTL-Q key either during a recording session, or during
             a playback, will cancel the record/playback, and will clear the
             keystroke buffer.

        ALT-9     Save recorded keystrokes.

             Pressing the ALT-9 key will pop-up a window allowing the user to
             save the recorded keystrokes into a file for use at a later time.
             You must stop recording by pressing the ALT-6 key before doing a
             save.  This key will also reset the record/playback function and
             clear the keystroke buffer.

        ALT-8     Load and Execute a saved keystroke file.

             Pressing the ALT-8 key will pop-up a window allowing the user to
             enter the name of a previously saved keystroke file.  After the
             file is loaded it will immediately be run.

        SHEZ will also allow the user to load and execute a save keystroke
        file at startup time.  The command line parameter /play={filespec}
        tells SHEZ to load the indicated filespec and playback the recorded
        keystrokes.
        PLEASE NOTE: SHEZ DOES NOT VERIFY THAT THE CONTENTS OF THIS FILE ARE
        ACTUALLY RECORDED KEYSTROKES. SO BE CAREFUL WHEN SPECIFYING THE
        FILESPEC!!

        Examples:
             SHEZ D:\DOWN\*.ZIP /PLAY=D:\AUTOSHEZ.MAC

        Start SHEZ and display all the .ZIP files in the D:\DOWN directory,
        and load and execute the recorded keystrokes contained in the
        D:\AUTOSHEZ.MAC file.

             SHEZ D:\SOURCE\CODE.ZIP /PLAY=D:\REFRESH.MAC

        Start SHEZ and open the CODE.ZIP file contained in the D:\SOURCE
        directory, and load and execute the recorded keystrokes contained in
        the D:\REFRESH.MAC file.

        The playback speed may also be sent to SLOW, MEDIUM, or FAST by using
        the mAcro drop down menu item and selecting the playback speed
        selection.  The playback speed default is set to FAST.

                             CREATING NEW COMPRESSED FILES

        SHEZ allows you to create new compressed files either from the
        directory display window, using the F7 key, or from the compressed
        file display window using the "C" command.

        A window will appear asking you to enter the drive, directory, of
        where to place the new file.  You may press the F9 key to view the
        directory structure in a tree format.  After selecting the location of
        the new file another aditios will appear asking you to specify the
        name of the compressed file to be created.  YOU MUST ENTER A FILE
|       EXTENSION OF .ZIP,.ARC,.LZH,.ZOO,ARJ,SQZ,.PAK, RAR, or UC2 SO SHEZ
|       KNOWS WHAT TYPE OF COMPRESSED FILE TO CREATE!!!!! Then you will asked
|       if you want to add or move files into the new archive file.  You will
|       also be asked to enter an optional password.  (If you enter a password
|       all files added or moved to the archive file will be encrypted using
|       the password. Do not forget the password you can not extract files
|       from the file without the password and there is no way to determine
|       the password if you forget it.)  Please note the password prompt will
|       only appear if the compression program used to create the new file
|       support encryption.

        A window will then be opened that will ask you to enter the filespecs
        of the files you wish to add or move into the new archive file. This
        filespec can include a disk, directory, and file specifications with
        wild cards.

        A third window will be opened allowing you to specify processing
        options.  The first option "Do you want to Tag files or Process as is"
        allows you to tell SHEZ that you want to Tag files for processing
        using the filespecs entered in the second window, or to simply pass
        the entered filespecs to the compression program exactly as entered.
        The second option "Do you want to save directory information" allows
        you to tell SHEZ that you want directory information saved in the
        compressed file.  The third option "Do you want to recurse
        directories"  will tell the compression program to add/move all files
        in the directory you specified plus all directories that exist beneath
        it.  A forth option will appear, "Store volume label into Compressed
        file? (Y or N)->".  This option will allow you to optionally store
        volume label information into the compressed file.  The default is not
        to store label information.  Respond Y if you wish to store the volume
        label information.  If you respond Y a fifth option will appear,
        "Enter drive letter of Volume label to Save".  When this prompt
        appears enter the letter of the drive you wish to obtain the volume
        label information from.

        If you are creating an ARJ file, you will also be asked if you wish to
        activate the multi-volume option of ARJ.  This option allows you to
        create a compressed file that will span multiple floppy disks.  Thus
        you can create a "backup" compressed file of an entire hard drive, or
        very large directory.

        If you indicated that you wanted to Tag files for processing a window
        will pop-up on the left side of the screen showing all files that
        matched the filespec you entered.  Tag the files you wish to add or
        move to the new compressed file by pressing the space bar.  When you
        are done tagging file press the return key and all tagged files will
        be added or moved into the new archive file.


                                   SHEZ USER MANUAL               Page -46-

        Please note that some of these options may not appear when you create
        a compressed file.  If the compression program you are using does not
        support saving directory information the directory information prompts
        will not appear.


                                   CONVERTING FILES

        Shez has the ability to convert one, or a group of tagged files, from
        one format to another.  First you must get the file or files you want
        to convert to appear in the filelist window on the left side of the
        screen.  The easiest way to do this is to start up SHEZ and specify on
        the command line either *.*, *.ZIP, or *.ARC.  Then using the cursor
        keys highlight the file you want to convert and then press the ALT-V
        key to convert the file. You will then be asked, via a menu, what
        archive format you want to convert to.  Position the highlight bar to
        the type of compressed file you wish to convert to and press the enter
        key.  You will also be asked if you want to delete the original file
        after the conversion has been successfully completed.  Respond Y or N.
        The new file will be placed on the same disk and directory that the
        original file was on.

        During the conversion process, SHEZ will convert any nested compressed
        files that is can identify.  NOTE: nested compressed files that have
        been stored with path names will not be converted.  Self extracting
        compressed files also will not be converted.  SHEZ can only process
        compressed nested files that are one level deep.  Any nested
        compressed files that are nested more than one level deep will remain
        un-touched.

        To convert numerous files start up SHEZ as above and use the cursor
        keys to highlight the files you want to convert, then press the space
        bar to TAG these files.  After all files have been tagged press CTL-V
        to convert all TAGGED files.

        SHEZ will allow you to easily convert your old ZIP files into the new
        ZIP imploded format.  Simply tag the ZIP files you want to convert and
        specify that you want to convert them to ZIP files.  You will be asked
        if you want to delete the old compressed files after the conversion
        process.  SHEZ is smart enough not to delete the old compressed file
        if the have the same file extension as the new files.  I.E. when you
        convert a ZIP file to a ZIP file to take advantage of the new
        compression format SHEZ will not delete the converted ZIP files even
        if you told it to delete the old compressed files after converting
        them.

        After SHEZ converts a compressed file it will test the converted file
        for correctness.  If the converted file fails this test the converted
        file will be deleted and the orginial compressed file will remain
        intact.


        SHEZ will also allow you to convert old LZH files to the new LHA 2.05
        format using the same method of converting a file to itself.

                           SUPPORT FOR SELF EXTRACTING FILES

        SHEZ also lets you view the contents of self extracting files.  Files
        that have been created by the following compression programs are
        supported:

        PKARC, PKPAK, PKZIP version .92 thru 2.04, LHARC version 1.12 thru
        2.05, PAK version 1.6 thru 2.01, ARC5 and ARC6, ARJ version 2.10, LHA
        2.12, SQZ 1.082 1.083.

        When you display the contents of a self extracting file SHEZ will
        attempt to identify which compression program was used to generate the
        self extracting file.  SHEZ will place the name of the compression
        program it has identified as the creator, on the heading line right
        next to the column titled NAME.

        In addition to viewing the contents of a self extracting file you may
        also extract individual files using SHEZ"s extract command.  You may
        also convert the self extracting file back to a normal compressed file
        using the CTL-V command, or using the pull down menus.

        You can not alter the contents of a self extracting file. I.E. add,
        update, freshen, move, etc.  The exception to this are self extracting
        files built by PKZIP.  These files you can treat like normal
        compressed files.  You can add, update, move, delete, freshen, etc.

                                 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

        SHEZ will recognize the following environment variables if they are
        set:

        BIOS      This will force SHEZ to use BIOS for writing to the screen.

        MONO      This will force SHEZ to run in monochrome mode.

        SHEZEX         You can set this variable to the disk and path where
                       you want SHEZ to write extracted file to. You can reset
                       this default at any time by using the ALT-P command.

        SHEZWORK  This variable may be used to specify a working directory for
                  SHEZ to use instead of SHEZ building one of its own.  This
                  directory must be for the exclusive of SHEZ, and must exist
                  prior to invoking SHEZ.  WHEN SHEZ TERMINATES ALL FILES IN
                  THE DIRECTORY WILL BE DELETED, INCLUDING HIDDEN AND SYSTEM
                  FILES, BUT THE DIRECTORY WILL NOT BE DELETED.  This option
                  was added to allow more flexibility when running SHEZ on a
                  LAN based system.

        SHEZCMT   This variable may be set to specify a default comment file
                  when adding/updating compressed file comment records to a
                  group of tagged files.

        SHEZCFG   This variable points to your SHEZ.CFG file.  It is used to
                  carry forward, the SHEZ configuration options.

        SHEZLOG   This variable defines the LOG file that SHEZ will write to
                  when performing a virus check on tagged files from the DOS
                  directory window.  If the file does not exist it will be
                  created.  If the fill already exists new information will be
                  appended to the existing file.

        SHEZXMS   This variable de-activates SHEZ"s use of XMS memory.  It
                  will over-ride the EMS/XMS usage parameters that were set
                  via the SHEZCFG program.  Set this variable to any value to
                  de-active XMS memory usage.
                  Example: SHEZXMS=N  Don"t use XMS memory.

        SHEZEMS   This variable de-activates SHEZ"s use of EMS memory.  It
                  will over-ride the EMS/XMS usage parameters that were set
                  via the SHEZCFG program.  Set this variable to any value to
                  de-active EMS memory usage.
                  Example: SHEZEMS=N  Don"t use EMS memory.

        SHEZUSE   Using this variable you can over-ride the EMS/XMS memory
                  usage configuration that was setup via the SHEZCFG program.
                  Set this variable to the type of memory you wish SHEZ to
                  use.  I.E. E for EMS memory, and/or X for XMS memory.

                  Examples:

                  SHEZUSE=EX     Try EMS first then XMS
                  SHEZUSE=XE     Try XMS first then EMS
                  SHEZUSE=E Only try EMS memory
                  SHEZUSE=X Only try XMS memroy
                  SHEZUSE=NN     Don"t use XMS or EMS memory.

        Examples:
        SET BIOS=Y
        SET MONO=Y
        SET SHEZEX=D:\WORK
        SET SHEZWORK=C:\SHEZXX\
        SET SHEZCMT=C:\COMMENT.DAT
        SET SHEZCFG=C:\DATA\SHEZ.CFG
        SET SHEZLOG=C:\LOG\SHEZ.LOG

        (This tells SHEZ to write extracted files onto the D disk in the \work
        directory.  You can change this at any time after executing SHEZ by
        using the ALT-P command.)

        The environment variables BIOS and MONO will override the BIOS and
        MONO parameters that were entered via the configuration program.

                            SETTING ALTERNATE FILE VIEWERS

        Shez has the capability to activate user specified alternate file
        viewers when the CTL-ENTER key is pressed.  The alternate file viewers
        are specified
        in an external file named SHEZ.INI.  This file is a plain ASCII text
        file that indicates to SHEZ what program should be run as the
        alternate viewer, based on the highlighted file"s extension, when a
        user pressing the CNTL-ENTER key.

        The external file, SHEZ.INI, MUST be located in the current directory,
        or in a directory that is specified in your path statement.

        SEE APPENDIX 2 FOR A FULL DESCRIPTION OF THE ENTRIES ALLOWABLE IN THE
        SHEZ.INI FILE.

                             SETTING USER DEFINED PRINTER

        The SHEZ.INI file also allows you to define up to three user defined
        printers.  Included with each printer definition is it"s name as it
        will appear on the menu, a required setup string, an optional endup
        string, the number of character per line to print, and the number of
        lines per page to print.  The format of the required entries in the
        SHEZ.INI file is shown in APPENDIX 2.

                         SETTING UP USED DEFINED MENU ENTRIES

        The SHEZ.INI file also allows user defined menu items to be defined.
        Up to twenty user defined programs and/or batch files can be specified
        and they will appear on the uSer menu option when selected.  See
        APPENDIX 2 for the format of the entries required in the SHEZ.INI
        file.

        Any number of specific file viewers may be specified.  When CTL-ENTER
        is pressed, SHEZ first looks to see of a specific alternate file
        viewer has been defined for viewing files with a file extension the
        same of the highlighted file.  If one was defined it is activated and
        used.  If a specific viewer has not been defined SHEZ then determines
        if a "generic" alternate file viewer has been defined. If it has SHEZ
        uses the "generic" viewer.  If no alternate viewer has been defined
        SHEZ than defaults to using the normal viewer as defined when the
        SHEZCFG program was used to configure SHEZ.

        PLEASE NOTE: WHEN SHEZ ACTIVATES ANY ALTERNATE FILE VIEWER IT ALWAYS
        USES ITS PAGING LOGIC TO SWAP MOST OF ITS CODE OUT OF MEMORY TO GIVE
        MORE ROOM TO THE ALTERNATE FILE VIEWER.  THIS IS NOT A CONFIGURABLE
        OPTION SO BE FOREWARNED!!!!!!!!!!!!


                                PERFORMING A VIRUS SCAN

        SHEZ can scan for viruses in files that are contained in compressed
        files. It can also scan for viruses in files that are contained in
        embedded compressed files.  SHEZ can check an unlimited number of
        embedded compressed files, only limited by the amount of available
        disk space assigned to the SHEZ work disk.  When performing a virus
        scan SHEZ will also check for self extracting compressed files and
        will also check any files contained with the SFX files.


                                   SHEZ USER MANUAL               Page -51-

        The first step performed during a virus check is to test the integrity
        of the compressed file.  If the integrity of the compressed file is
        compromised, all other action on the compressed file will be bypassed,
        and an error message will be issued.

        There are two way to perform a virus scan.  One is activated from the
        DOS directory window, and the other is invoked after opening up a
        compressed file.

        To perform a virus scan from the DOS directory window, tag the files
        you wish to check for viruses then press the ALT-Z or CTL-Z keys.
        This will initiate the scanning process on all tagged files.

        When virus checking files from the main DOS directory window, SHEZ
        will create a virus check log file if the environment variable SHEZLOG
        is defined.  For more information on this variable set the section
        entitled ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE on page 48.  The log file will be
        created if is does not exists, or will be appended to if it already
        exists.  The file will contain a listing of all the compressed files
        that are being checked, plus a list of all files within the compressed
        files that will be checked.  If a self extracting file is encountered,
        the log file will post an entry to the log file identifying the SFX
        file, and what type SFX it is.  Each time the log file is opened a
        time and date stamp line will be written into the file before any
        scanning occurs.  The log file is NOT updated when doing a virus scan
        from within an opened compressed file, it is only updated/created when
        doing a scan from the DOS directory window.

        BBS SYSOP NOTE:
             When performing a bulk virus scan on a group of tagged files SHEZ
             operates differently depending on in the SHEZLOG feature is
             active.  If the SHEZLOG feature is NOT active, any errors
             encountered will cause an error message box to appear on the
             screen, and all activity will stop until a key is pressed.  If
             the SHEZLOG feature is active, all error messages will be posted
             to the file pointed to by the SHEZLOG environment variable.  No
             error messages will appear on the screen.  Also when operating in
             this mode, you may cancel the bulk virus scan, after initiating
             it, by press the ESC key.

        To perform a virus scan when viewing the contents of a compressed
        file, simply press the ALT-Z keys.  When doing a virus scan from
        within an opened compressed file, SHEZ will also look for embedded
        compressed files and will perform the scan on files contained within
        them.  The only exception to this is if you are looking inside an
        embedded compressed file when you activate the scan, (ALT-Z).  Under
        this condition SHEZ will only check the files contained in the current
        compressed file.

        VIRUS CHECKING SELECTED FILES

        If you wish to only check a few files contained in a compressed file
        for viruses, tag the files you wish to check then press the ALT-Z key.
        Only the tagged files will be checked instead of all in the compressed
        file.

        VIRUS SCANNING A DIRECTORY


                                   SHEZ USER MANUAL               Page -52-

        When in the DOS directory view screen you may also virus scan an
        entire directory.  Simply move the highlight bar to the directory you
        wish to scan and press the ALT-S keys.  SHEZ will use the user defined
        virus scanning program to scan the files in the highlighted directory.

                                   THE SGREP PROGRAM

        The SGREP program, supplied with SHEZ, is used by SHEZ when the ALT-G
        key is pressed, to scan member(s) of a compressed file for words or
        phrases.  It is included in the SHEZ package .

        SGREP allows the user to specify two target strings in the search
        argument.  These two target strings are connected with an and, &, or
        or, "|" separator.  Thus allowing the user to search for two different
        strings, or two strings or words contained on the same line.  When the
        specific string is found, the line in the file that contains the
        string is written to the stdout DOS device, which is normally the
        display.  SGREP also has the capability to search the specified
        file(s) for a regular expression.  When performing a regular
        expression search only one target may be specified.  See REGULAR
        EXPRESSIONS below on how to build a regular expression.  The output
        may be redirected to a file or a printer using the normal DOS
        redirection symbols.  The format of the SGREP command line is as
        follows:

        SGREP [options] "target(s)" {file(s)...|@file}

        Where options are:

             -f   display **FILE-NAME for finds only
             -l   line numbers
             -c   case sensitive search
             -x   no logo
             -e   return errorlevel only
             -p   pause when screen is full
             -v   verbose display output
             -r   target is a regular expression

        @file indicates an ascii file containing a list of file to process.
        This list MUST include the complete file specification.  I.E. The
        disk, directory, filename, and file extension.

        The target string(s) must be enclosed in quotes and special characters
        can be specified as indicated below.

        Hex byte sequences can be used to search for special non-displayable
        characters.  They are specified using a pair of hexadecimal bytes
        preceded by a dollar sign,$.

        EXAMPLES: $23       include is the string #include
                  $252.50        is the string %2.50
                  $23$24$25 is the string #$%

        Two targets may be specified using the & and | characters to search
        for two targets.  If the & is used the lines must contain
        both targets.  If the | is used the lines must contain one of the
        targets.

        Example:       "save|main"    line must have save or main to be
        listed.
                  "save&main"    line must have save and main to be listed.

        The format of the SGREP command line is presented here for
        documentation purposes only since SHEZ automatically invokes the SGREP


                                   SHEZ USER MANUAL               Page -54-

        itself using a predefined set of options.  SGREP may be run from the
        DOS command prompt, or when using the ALT-Y command option of SHEZ.

                                  REGULAR EXPRESSIONS

        The regular_expression defines the pattern to search for.  Upper- and
        lower-case are always ignored.  Blank lines never match.  The
        expression should be quoted to prevent file-name translation.

        x     An ordinary character (not mentioned below) matches that
             character.
        "\"  The backslash quotes any character.  "\$" matches a dollar-sign.
        "^"  A circumflex at the beginning of an expression matches the
             beginning of a line.
        "$"  A dollar-sign at the end of an expression matches the end of a
             line.
        "."  A period matches any character except "new-line".
        "*"  An expression followed by an asterisk matches zero or more
             occurrances of that expression: "fo*" matches "f", "fo"  "foo",
             etc.
        "+"  An expression followed by a plus sign matches one or more
             occurrances of that expression: "fo+" matches "fo", etc.
        "-"  An expression followed by a minus sign optionally matches the
             expression.

        "[]" A string enclosed in square brackets matches any character in
             that string, but no others.  If the first character in the string
             is a circumflex, the expression matches any character except
             "new-line" and the characters in the string.  For  example,
             "[xyz]" matches "xx" and "zyx", while "[^xyz]"      matches "abc"
             but not "axb".  A range of characters may be specified by two
             characters separated by "-".  Note that, [a-z] matches
             alphabetics, while [z-a] never matches.

                                  THE DUMPMAC PROGRAM


        The DUMPMAC program is a small program designed to dump a saved macro
        file to the DOS stdout device, normally the screen, and list the
        recorded keystrokes in readable form.  The command line format is:

        DUMPMAC macro-file-name

        The output of the program is self explanatory, and can be used to
        debug or list unknown SHEZ macro files.

                                  THE SHEZCFG PROGRAM

        The SHEZCFG program is now fully menu driven and contains full online
        help.  As you modify information on each screen be sure to press the
        F10 key to save each entry screen.  After going through all the
        configuration items be sure to select the "A" menu item to save your
        configuration information.

        THE SHEZCFG PROGRAM MUST BE RUN TO CREATE A CONFIGURATION FILE OR SHEZ
        WILL NOT RUN!!

        After creating a shez configuration file you may place the
        configuration file into a directory that is specified in your PATH
        statement.

        Shez will find its configuration file as follows:

             If the SHEZCFG environment variable is set SHEZ will use the
             configuration file that has been specified by the environment
             variable.
             If the SHEZCFG environment varialble has not been set Shez will
             search the directories in your PATH looking for a file named
             SHEZ.CFG.

             If a valid configuration file can not be located SHEZ will not
             run!!!!!


                            CONFIGURING FOR VIRUS SCANNING

        Under the program options, you will be asked if you wish to configure
        SHEZ to scan .COM and .EXE files contained in compressed files for
        viruses. If you respond Y, SHEZ will that ask you where the virus
        checking program can be found.  The programs that SHEZ supports are,
        SCAN.EXE version 39 or greater, produced by McAfee Associates, and the
        virus scanning program by Central Point.  When prompted enter the
        complete DISK:\DIRECTORY\FILENAME.EXT of where the virus scanning
        program is located.  It is advised that you place the SCAN program on
        a write protected floppy disk to prevent it from being infected.  You
        may also optionally enter any additional command line options that the
        virus scanning program requires.  The optional parameters are entered
        after the SHEZCFG prompts for them.

        If you use the /report feature of McAfee"s virus scanning program, and
        you use the SHEZLOG feature, as explained in the section titled

        SHEZ achieves fast screen updates buy writing directly to video buffer
        memory.  If your machine is not 100% compatible you can force SHEZ to
        use BIOS routines to update the screen.  This is accomplished by
        setting an environment variable BIOS equal to Y. I.E. SET BIOS=Y. Do
        this before executing SHEZ.

        For monochrome monitors a similar method is employed set the
        environment variable MONO equal to Y.  I.E.  SET MONO=Y.

        Some clone machines have a bug in the builtin BIOS routines that will
        cause SHEZ to hang if you have exploding windows turned on.  If you
        experience a machine lock up, try reconfiguring SHEZ and turn the
        exploding windows off.

                                DESQVIEW COMPATIBILITY

        SHEZ is now DESQview aware.  When setting SHEZ up under DESQview set
        the parameter WRITE DIRECTLY TO SCREEN to NO, and USES OWN COLORS to
        YES.  SHEZ will also automatically release its timeslice to Desqview
        when waiting for keyboard input.

                            WINDOWS AND OS/2 COMPATIBILITY

        SHEZ has been tested under Windows 3.1 and OS/2 2.X.  When running
        under OS/2 or Windows enhanced mode, SHEZ will automatically release
        its timeslice to the operating system when waiting for keyboard input.

                              SWAPPING SHEZ OUT OF MEMORY

        This section briefly describes how SHEZ swaps itself out of memory to
        make room for other programs.  It also describes how the user can
        configure SHEZ to perform its swapping function.

        When you configure SHEZ to swap itself out of memory when running
        other programs, SHEZ first looks to see if your system has EMS or XMS
        memory installed. If there is EMS or XMS memory, and there is a
        sufficient amount of EMS or XMS memory, SHEZ will copy most of its
        code to EMS  or XMS memory then free up enough memory to run another
        program.  After the other program has ended SHEZ then swaps itself
        back into memory.

        As a default SHEZ will first look to see of XMS memory is available.
        If XMS is available and there is a sufficient amount of XMS memory
        SHEZ will swap itself to XMS memory.  If XMS memory is not available,
        or there is not enough XMS memory available, SHEZ will them look for
        EMS memory.  If EMS memory is available, and there is sufficient EMS
        memory, SHEZ will swap itself into EMS memory.  If EMS memory is not
        available, or there is not enough EMS memory available SHEZ will then
        swap itself to disk.

        If EMS or XMS memory is not available, or there is not enough EMS or
        XMS memory, SHEZ will then use your DISK to swap itself out of memory.
        It allocates disk space on the currently active drive and in the
        current directory.  When SHEZ swaps to disk it can conflict with some
        compression operations.

        To solve this problem the SHEZCFG program allows you to tell SHEZ, HOW
        AND WHERE TO SWAP itself.  The SHEZCFG program allows you to tell SHEZ
        the DISK and DIRECTORY of where to build its swapper file if it needs
        to swap to disk.

        IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU CREATE A SEPARATE AND UNIQUE
        DIRECTORY ON YOUR HARD DRIVE FOR SHEZ TO USE WHEN SWAPPING TO DISK.
        THIS DIRECTORY SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY FILES IN THE DIRECTORY. USING THE
        SHEZCFG PROGRAM, TELL SHEZ THE LOCATION AND THE NAME OF THIS
        DIRECTORY.  THEN IF SHEZ NEEDS TO SWAP TO DISK IT WILL PLACE THE
        SWAPPER FILE INTO THIS UNIQUE DIRECTORY, AND AFTER THE SWAP FUNCTION
        IS COMPLETE IT WILL REMOVE THE SWAPPER FILE.

        The SHEZCFG program also allows you to tell SHEZ to ignore EMS or XMS
        memory, even if you have EMS and/or XMS memory installed, and always
        swap to disk.

        Since these option are new in release 6.1

        PLEASE RUN THE SHEZCFG PROGRAM AND SET THE SWAPPING OPTIONS TO YOUR
        PERSONAL NEEDS.

        The swapping options can be found under the ADDITIONAL SETUP
        INFORMATION menu item.  You can tell SHEZ to use XMS, EMS, and disk
        for swapping.  If you specify all three XMS will be tested first, then
        EMS, then disk.


                             USING EMS/XMS MEMORY IN SHEZ

        Beginning with release 7.0 of SHEZ, SHEZ can now use 65K of XMS or EMS
        memory to reduce its DOS memory requirements.  The XMS/EMS memory is
        used for temporary storage areas, thus reducing the amount of DOS
        memory SHEZ needs.  The XMS/EMS memory will be released when you exit
        SHEZ.  If SHEZ uses EMS memory, it will also use a portion of the
        allocated EMS memory as a file buffer area when copying files from the
        DOS directory display.  This will significantly speed up the copy
        operations, so it is recommenced to use EMS memory if it is available.

        EMS / XMS memory usage can be configured through the SHEZCFG program
        via the ADDITIONAL SETUP INFORMATION menu item.  Shown below is the
        EMS/XMS configuration option as it will appear on the screen:


        SHEZ can use EMS or XMS memory to reduce its memory

        requirements.  SHEZ will first try to use EMS and then XMS if

        EMS memory is not available.  You can tell SHEZ to only use EMS,

        only use XMS, not to use either, or to try XMS first then EMS.


        At the prompt enter EX to use EMS then XMS,
             OR  enter XE to use XMS then EMS,
             OR  enter E  to use only EMS,
             OR  enter X  to use only XMS,
             OR  enter to spaces to not use EMS or XMS.

        Enter EMS-XMS usage as described above->EX


        You can over-ride the memory usage options through the use of
        environment variables.  See the section titled ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
        for more information.

                               SPEECH FRIENDLY INTERFACE

        Release 7.1 of SHEZ implements a new feature called Speech Friendly
        Interface, (SFI).  This feature makes SHEZ more friendly to users with
        speech synthesizer boards, (these enable the blind users to read the
        computer display).  The SFI interface has been implemented in three
        parts. In addition the Copyright box will not appear in the upper
        right corner of the display, leaving the screen a little cleaner.

        The first SFI feature is that most dialog boxes, error message boxes
        and informational boxes will be displayed using DOS BIOS routines
        instead of writing directly to the video buffers.  This feature should
        make interfacing SHEZ to a speech synthesizer a little eaiser.

        The second SFI feature will position the cursor on the currently
        active screen line. This feature has been implemented when viewing the
        DOS directory listing, the compressed files listing, the help screens,
        and the drop down menu system.  When possible the cursor will be
        placed to the right of the first pertinent data appearing on the
        screen.

        However there are some dialog boxes, and prompt boxes that this
        positioning is not 100% accurate.  To solve this problem, the third
        part of the SFI interface includes the ability to "FREEZE" the screen,
        and use the cursor keys to walk around the screen.

        To freeze the screen press the ` (left single quote character). This
        will place the screen in a frozen state UNTIL YOU PRESS THE ` KEY
        AGAIN. When the freeze frame is activated a low to high beep sound
        will be made.  When exiting the freeze frame feature a high to low
        beep will be made. While in the frozen state the following cursor
        movement keys are active:

        CURSOR-UP =    move cursor up one line
        CURSOR-DOWN    =    move cursor down one line
        CURSOR-LEFT    =    move cursor left on character
        CURSOR-RIGHT   =    move cursor right one character
        PAGE-UP   =    move cursor to upper left corner of screen
        PAGE-DOWN =    move cursor to lower left corner of screen
        CONTROL-HOME   =    move cursor to first significant character on
                            current line. (A significant character is a
                            character having an ascii code greater then a
                            decimal 20, and less than a decimal 123)
        HOME      =    move cursor to where is originally was before you
                       started fussing with it.

        The SFI support routines are activated by using the SHEZCFG program,
        and setting the SFI option to Y.


                                 4DOS AND NDOS SUPPORT

        Shez offers limited support for certain capabilities when running
        under 4DOS and NDOS.  Shez can automatically determine if it is
        running under either of these systems and will active support for
        their facilities automatically.  The following facilities are
        supported:


                                   SHEZ USER MANUAL               Page -61-

        1)   When viewing a DOS directory display pressing the ALT-D keys will
             display the 4DOS/NDOS description entries if any exist.

        2)   When viewing a DOS directory display pressing the ALT-U keys will
             allow you to UPDATE and/or ADD description entries to the
             currently highlighted file.  This will also active the ALT-D
             option automatically.  When adding a description to a file if the
             4DOS/NDOS DESCRIPT.ION file does not exist one will be created,
             if the file already exists it will be updated.

        3)   When copying, moving, or renaming files the 4DOS/NDOS description
             will be carried along with the file.  If the file is renamed the
             entry in the DESCIPT.ION file will be modified accordingly.

        4)   AT THE CURRENT TIME SHEZ DOES NOT MODIFY THE DESCIPT.ION FILE
             WHEN YOU DELETE A FILE.  THE FILES DESCRIPTION WILL REMAIN IN THE
             4DOS/NDOS DESCRIPT.ION FILE.

                           USING 4DOS INTERNAL LIST COMMAND

        SHEZ can be configured to use the internal LIST command of 4DOS as the
        default file viewer.  To configure SHEZ for this feature, use the
        SHEZCFG program and select option 5 and press F10 until the menu
        titled OTHER PROGRAMS TO USE appears.  Answer Y to the question, "When
        running under 4DOS use 4DOS internal list command".  You may also
        enter blanks in the area that asks for the Viewing-program to use.

                             SUPPORT FOR SPANNED ZIP FILES

        SHEZ now offers support for ZIP files that span multiple floppies.
        Due to the nature of these types of ZIP files SHEZ will limit the
        operations that can be performed on spanned ZIP files.  SHEZ will
        allow you to create spanned ZIP files and extract from spanned ZIP
        files, but SHEZ will not allow you to modify the ZIP file after it is
        created.  You may not ADD, DELETE, RENAME, CONVERT, or add comments to
        the spanned file.  If you attempt to perform an illegal operation SHEZ
        will display a dialog box informing you that the operation selected
        can not be performed.  Also it should be noted that SHEZ, in it's
        current release, can only handle a maximum of 3500 files per
        compressed file.  If you create a spanned ZIP file containing more
        than 3500 files SHEZ can only process the first 3500 files it finds in
        the ZIP file.

        Normally when you extract files from a spanned ZIP file PKUNZIP will
        ask that you insert the last disk of the backup set first.  SHEZ
        operates just the reverse.  When reading spanned ZIP files SHEZ will
        ask that you insert the first disk of the backup set and each
        subsequent disk.  In effect it reads the ZIP from front to back.  This
        may seem strange, but when SHEZ is done reading the spanned ZIP file
        the last disk of the backup set will already be in the drive, so when
        you perform an extract you will not have to insert the last disk of
        the set as required by PKUNZIP.

        Support was added for spanned ZIP files due to numerous user requests.
        If you are using the spanned disk feature to backup a hard drive
        please keep in mind that SHEZ will only be able to handle a maximum of
        3500 files in the ZIP file.


                           SUPPORT FOR UC2 COMPRESSED FILES

        SHEZ now offers support for UC2, Ultracompressor II, type compressed
        files.  SHEZ can convert to/from UC2 compressed files to/from any
        other compressed file format without the need of the file conversion
        .BAT files that are distributed with the UC2 package.  There is a
        special menu item that allows you to configure the UC2 program via
        it's internal configuration option.  The menu item is contained in the
        Opts main menu and is titled, FULL UC2 CONFIGURATION.  When
        configuring SHEZ please be sure to specify the UC.EXE file as the
        program to run when processing UC2 type compressed files.  Since SHEZ
        has it's own memory management routines builtin you do not need to use
        the Stealth technology that is available in the UC2 package.

        SHEZ does support FRESHEN and UPDATE commands if you are running
        release 2 of UC2..  SHEZ does support the storing and retrieval of
        "file versions" as documented in the UC2 manual.  It also supports
        storing and retrieval of files stored in directories within UC2 files.

|                      SUPPORT FOR WINDOWS TYPE COMPRESSED FILES

|       Shez supports the viewing and expanding of Windows type compressed
|       files.  Most of these type files have an underscore in the file
|       extension.  Shez uses the "native" EXPAND.EXE program to expand the
|       compressed file.  The EXPAND.EXE program must be located in a
        directory that is specified in your path statement.  If it is not you
        must copy  the file to a directory that is listed in your path

        statement.  The 10.3 release of SHEZ handles these files differently
|       than the 10.2 release of SHEZ.  To view a windows type compressed
|       file.  Highlight the file in the DOS directory screen of SHEZ and
|       press the enter key.  SHEZ will display the compressed and expanded
|       file sizes.  Press the enter key again and SHEZ will invoke the
|       default file view program allowing you to view the file.  To expand
|       the compressed file, instead of pressing the enter key, press the E
|       key to expand the file.  During both of these processes SHEZ will
|       prompt  you for a character to replace the underscore character in the
|       file extension.

|                          SUPPORT FOR INFOZIP ZIP AND UNZIP

|       If you are using the INFOZIP ZIP and UNZIP programs you must run the
|       SHEZCFG program and under the Program setup screen set the INFOZIP
|       field to a Y.  If this is not donw SHEZ will think you are using the
|       PKZIP and PKUNZIP programs.

                            LICENSING SHEZ FOR PERSONAL USE

        Shez is marketed as a shareware program.  This marketing method gives
        the user the opportunity to evaluate the program before actually
        registering the software.  If after a two week evaluation period you
        determine that SHEZ meets your needs, you are required to register
        your copy of SHEZ with California Software Design.  To register your
        copy of SHEZ, complete the registration form that is distributed with
        the SHEZ package, include your payment and mail to California Software
        Design, P.O. Box 15248, Santa Rosa, CA 95402.

        You may also register SHEZ via the Compuserve shareware registration
        service.  See the SHEZ.REG file included with this package for
        information on how to use this service.

        When your registration form is processed you will be mailed an
        individual serial number, along with a receipt for your registration
        fee.

                           CORPORATE SITE LICENSING FOR SHEZ

        A license is required for use of SHEZ by corporations and
        institutions.


        You may obtain a license for the use of SHEZ by writing to me.  The
        license is for perpetual, nonexclusive use of any version.  Purchase
        orders and invoicing are acceptable.  A license agreement form will be
        sent upon request.  You may use it, or supply your own for my review.
        There are no restrictions to the number of sites, or for use on local
        area networks.  If you have special requirements, or need
        customization, please feel free to submit them in writing.  You may
        request a license for:

        1)   A fixed number of copies, see the discount schedule;
        2)   An unlimited number of copies, the minimum fee is $1200;
        3)   Customization of messages and documentation,  an additional fee
             may be required depending on the extent of changes;
        4)   Permission to distribute within your organization;

        The fee for a license depends on the estimated number of copies of the
        program that you will use.  To use the discount schedule below,
        estimate the total number of copies that you may eventually use.

        Number of users(copies)  Price per copy
        1  to  10           $39.00
        11 to  30           $35.00
        31 and up           $31.00
        Please contact California Software Design for site license prices.

        Regardless of the quantity, only one set of materials will be sent to
        you.  You may then make as many copies of it that are licensed.
        Upgrades will be made available upon request.  Technical support is
        available via mail, or contacting me via Compuserve 76266,2634, on
        GENIE mail id is J.DERR1. OR via Internet. My internet address is
