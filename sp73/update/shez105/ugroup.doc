I am offering a very attractive pricing plan for PC user groups. If you
would like more information about my user group pricing plan, please
contact me via Cserve, Genie, Internet mail, or via one of the SHEZ
conferences.  If all else fails drop me a note and I'll send you the
information via normal mail.
