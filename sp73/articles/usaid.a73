          Remarks of USAID Adminstrator Brian Atwood
          3 February 1995, As Prepared

Summit on Africa Aid
Washington, D.C.

     I am pleased to be with you today as President Clinton's
representative.  I understand that the President has issued a
statement that was shared with you.  As you heard, it underscores
the abiding commitment of this Administration to Africa.
>From time to time American ballot boxes produce what are called
revolutions.  We know about the revolution sparked by the Voting
Rights Act.  Franklin Roosevelt's election created a revolution.
So did Ronald Reagan's.       We are in the early stages of a
revolution in Washington today.  And, as in every other time in
our history, good can emerge from the changes this revolution
brings.       Congressional reform -- the streamlining of the
institution, the increased transparency, open rules -- this is
all long overdue.  A Gore-Gingrich collaboration to reinvent
government is something the American people welcome.  This is not
politics-as-usual, and it can produce positive change.       But
in the fervor that accompanies the early stages of a revolution,
incautious positions are often asserted.  At the least, before
such positions become the accepted wisdom, someone must challenge
them, civilly, but forcefully.  That is the only way we can keep
revolution on a healthy course.  Indeed, that is the way mandates
for change are interpreted and given real meaning.       A case
in point is the assertion that we have no national interests in
Africa.  That we must reduce or eliminate development assistance
to that continent.  That Africa has neither geopolitical
importance for the United States nor economic value.       With
all the force we can muster, we say: That is just plain wrong.

  Let's examine the question objectively.  For just a moment,
let's leave out America's humanitarian values.  Let's put aside
our historic ties to Africa.  Let's forget sentimentality.
Instead, let's talk about hard economic facts and markets and
sales.  Let's ask ourselves: is Africa worth the investment?  Is
a continent of half a billion people worth one-half of one- tenth
of one percent of the federal budget, which is what we now spend
on it?  Is the three dollars and change that each American family
pays each year to help several dozen sub- Saharan nations a
burden worth the price?       Of course it is.  It's a good deal
for America.  It's a good investment for Americans.  Our aid to
Africa is not welfare, nor is it charity.  It is an investment we
make in other people for our own self-interest.       How we do
build markets?  The answer is simple: we do it by making
investments for the future.  That is what vision is all about.
That is what practical reality teaches us too.  If we want to
talk economic rationales, then we must look at Africa as the last
great developing market.  We must look at it the way we looked at
Latin America and Asia a generation ago.       Consider Latin
America; today it is the fastest growing market for American
goods.  This is a huge new middle class market of 350 million
people.  It got that way because of investments made during the
last forty years -- $30.7 billion in economic assistance from the
United States between 1949 and 1993.  Yet our exports to all of
Latin American in 1993 alone were more than two-and-a-half times
that amount -- $78 billion.  Quite a payoff in jobs and income,
and that was just one year.  And the Latin American market is
likely to grow three times larger in the next decade.       Where
would we be if John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon
had not committed themselves to the Alliance for Progress and the
education programs that helped create a generation of economists
and technicians who now lead South America's impressive growth?
What kind of customers would we have if we had not supported
health and education programs that invested in the human capital
of Latin America, an investment that now is producing an
educated, healthy workforce that can afford to buy our goods and
services?  What kind of stability would we have in this market if
we had not supported democracy-building programs that have made
military juntas and coups a thing of the past?        It is an
interesting exercise to compare sub-Saharan Africa today to three
of the newest "Asian Tigers" -- Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand
-- as they were in 1960: African per capita income is today 80%
of what it was in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand 35 years ago.

But Africa today has four times the number of people Malaysia,
Indonesia, and Thailand had in 1960.  Think of the potential of
this African market, even at its current stage of development.

  The bottom line is that Africa today is not significantly
behind where the "Asian Tigers" were in 1960.  In the three
decades since, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand substantially
reduced poverty, their rates of population growth, infant
mortality, and illiteracy.  These countries are now major players
in the world economy.  We believe Africa can do as well.
The doubters should not just look at Africa's potential; the
market is already significant, and like other developing markets,
it is growing far faster than our markets in Europe.  In 1992,
sub-Saharan Africa imported $63 billion worth of merchandise from
the world.  African imports have risen by around 7.0% per year
for the past decade.  At this rate, the African market would
amount to $480 billion by the year 2025.  That is approximately
$267 billion in today's dollars.         The U.S. currently
accounts for nearly 10% of the African market.  Do the
arithmetic.  Each American family now spends about $3 annually on
aid to Africa.  At current growth rates, that will produce
something like $50 billion worth of American exports to Africa
each year in 30 years.  In 2025, the U.S. is projected to have a
population of 320 million.  Again, do the arithmetic.  $50
billion worth of exports would work out to about $600 worth of
exports per family, annually, in 2025.  And that is if Africa's
growth remains at its current level; if we make the investments
Africa needs, and if African nations implement the kind of
policies that have benefitted Asia and Latin America, the return
for each American family in thirty years could be as much as
$2000 per year.       These are not trivial amounts.  They
represent millions of jobs for our children, financial health for
our nation.         Isn't Africa worth the investments now that
we made in Asia and Latin America?  Those who argue against such
investments are shortchanging the next generation of Americans.
There is, of course, no guarantee that our investment will pay
dividends, but it is as good a bet as most mutual funds.
Moreover, the cost of not acting could overwhelm our treasury,
and, I fear, our consciences.       Those who say we have no
strategic interest in Africa should understand that if African
nations fail to make progress, if they descend into chaos and
decay, the tragedy will not take place in a vacuum.  Chaos there
will affect our interests here.  As long as we remain true to our
values -- and there is a strong bipartisan consensus that
suggests we will (even Pat Buchanan supports disaster relief) --
the costs of humanitarian operations will continue to be borne in
part by the United States.  If more African nations fail, we will
share the costs of caring for the millions of refugees.  We will
shoulder the burdens of dealing with endless famine.  And we will
have to confront the spreading political disorder, the
environmental damage, and the consequent loss of markets for our
goods.       Parts of Africa are living on the edge.  Many
African nations face adverse climatic and soil conditions.  Each
day, people in these countries face problems of poor health and
malnutrition and illiteracy that few other peoples confront.

Yet lost in the apocalyptic descriptions of an Africa seemingly
falling apart is genuine reason for encouragement.  The headlines
rarely report the many positive developments and success stories
in Africa.  Yet in a number of African nations,
democratically-elected, enlightened leaders, committed to
broadening participation and undertaking reforms necessary for
development, are creating an environment for success.  This, too,
is the reality of Africa:          USAID today is working in 35
African nations that, in our judgment, are in various phases of
consolidating their democracies, creating free markets, and
implementing serious economic reforms.  Conversely, we have ended
our involvement in several nations where the governments refuse
to  commit themselves to reform or to a development partnership
with their own citizens.          A new generation of African
leaders is pursuing extensive economic restructuring programs,
including privatization of state-owned enterprises, reducing
government functions and budgets, stabilizing the economy, and
implementing policy changes that help the private sector expand.

       New crops and market liberalization are expanding food
production, raising farmer income and reducing food prices for
consumers.          More children, especially girls, are
attending school so that they can become more productive members
of society.  And we know from our own experience that more than
any other factor, improving the education of girls and the status
of women enhances the economy, the environment, and the prospects
of democracy.          Programs to expand immunization and use of
oral rehydration therapy are saving an estimated 800,000 African
children each year.          Fertility is starting to fall as
more and more parents use family planning services.       I am
proud that USAID has played a role in every one of these
achievements.       For every Rwanda there is a Ghana -- a nation
that has begun revitalizing its economy and is intent on being
part of the worldwide economic expansion.       For every
Somalia, there is a South Africa or a Namibia -- nations that
have successfully implemented democracy and peaceful change.

For every Angola, there is a Mozambique, emerging now from civil
conflict.       For every tragedy, there are a half dozen islands
of hope.  Progress is still tentative, often fragile.  Which is
precisely why we must not hesitate now.  But this continent is no
write-off.  It is a good investment.       We have learned from
the mistakes we made during the Cold War.  We now are
concentrating our aid in countries that are implementing sound
economic policies, promoting an open and democratic society, and
investing their own resources in broad-based development.  That
is exactly what the Congress wanted to accomplish with the
Development Fund for Africa.  And that is why this Administration
strongly supports the Development Fund for Africa.  Under this
fund, we have taken a longer-term approach to Africa's
development, systematically addressing the root causes --
economic, social, and political -- of underdevelopment.       In
those countries stricken with disaster or famine, we are treating
emergency relief as more than an end in itself.  Rather, we are
structuring it to help nations make the difficult transition from
crisis to the path of sustainable development.       President
Clinton's Initiative for the Greater Horn of Africa is designed
to apply the lessons we learned in the Sahel and Southern Africa
to a troubled region that now consumes nearly half of all African
relief.  By emphasizing regional cooperation and planning, by
helping nations acquire the ability to respond to food crises
early on, we can prevent droughts from becoming famines.  This
Initiative, we believe, will save lives and resources.  The
partnerships it builds will enable the donor community to save
billions of dollars in relief assistance over the next fifteen
years and focus resources instead on recovery efforts and
long-term development.       To prevent more failed nations, the
United States must strengthen our efforts to prevent crisis and
to encourage others to do so as well.  While we only provide five
percent of the development assistance that Africa receives, we
provide 30 percent of the relief assistance directed at the
continent's emergencies.  It is a lot less expensive to lead the
way on prevention than it is to pay the costs of failure.       I
am able to make the case for assistance to Africa today because
USAID has reorganized itself to be an effective instrument of
development.  Many of our reforms were pioneered by the
Development Fund for Africa.  The DFA forced us to measure
results and now we are going to do this everywhere.  Our work in
Africa has been an essential part of our identity, and must
remain so.       So now we have a fight on our hands.  We welcome
it.  If the revolution has indeed begun, then each of us must do
everything we can to ensure that the well-being of our children
-- and the children of Africa -- is advanced by the vision
today's revolution produces.  We cannot be silent.  We cannot
wring our hands.  The case for Africa gives us the opportunity to
be the champions of common sense.  This is a battle well worth
waging.  Not for African Americans, not for historical reasons,
not even for our humanitarian values, though we must never forget
them.  This is a battle worth waging for America's national
interests and the future of our children.  We will wage it.  And
I am confident that, in the end, common sense will prevail.
