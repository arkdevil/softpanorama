I have uploaded to WSMR-SIMTEL20.Army.Mil and OAK.Oakland.Edu:

C_PRETTY.ZIP 	Word Basic macro for formatting C code (W4Win2)

The macro converts reserved words to bold, some of the more important
library functions to italics, c-preprocessor statements to bold-italic,
and comments to italics.  It is easy to modify and includes instructions
on how to make a Word for Windows macro out of the file.
