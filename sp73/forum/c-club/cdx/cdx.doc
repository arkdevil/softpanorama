CDX


Michael Holmes and Bob Flanders                     April 30, 1991 (Utilities)


Purpose:   Provides an alternative to the DOS CD command that eliminates the
need to enter long path and directory names and that finds and changes to
directories containing specified filenames.

Format:   CDX [/?] [/B] [/+] [/F filename] [d:]p1 p2 ..pn

Remarks:  Entered without any of the optional / switches, CDX searches one or
more hard drives d: for a specified directory p1. If found, the full path is
displayed with a ? prompt and is selected by typing Y; typing N continues the
search for another qualifying directory. If the d: parameter is omitted, only
the current drive is checked; *: searches all hard drives, starting with C:. 
Multiple drives listed as d:, including floppies (if desired) are searched in
named order,  e.g. DCAB:. If d: is preceded by a minus sign (-) the drive(s)
listed are excluded rather than included.

        The p1 target directory name can be truncated to as little as their
initial letter. To prevent having to bypass an inconvenient number of 
qualifying directories at the ? prompt, multiple values of p, each separated 
by a space, can be used to construct an abbreviated path, which need not 
include all steps. If the initial p1 begins with a backslash (\) the search
 will be made from the root rather than the current directory.

        Any optional / switches used on the CDX command line must precede 
the d:p1 parameters. Using the /F switch limits qualifying directories to 
those containing a user-specified filename. The filename supports the * and ? 
DOS wildcards, and if all the subdirectories of d: are to be searched, p1 may 
be omitted or replaced by an asterisk (*). Supplying the /B switch
automatically selects the first qualifying directory, eliminating the user-
prompt. The /+ switch includes floppy disk drives A: and B: in the search, and
the /? switch brings up a syntax help screen.

        In keeping with DOS conventions, entering CDX with no parameters or
with a single dot parameter simply displays and the current directory. CDX ..
changes to the parent directory, and CDX \ changes to the root directory of
the current drive. Note: to change to the root directory of a different drive
using CDX requires using a single space as the value of p1 immediately
following the backslash. Thus, CDX /B E:\ will change to the E: root directory
without an intervening prompt.
