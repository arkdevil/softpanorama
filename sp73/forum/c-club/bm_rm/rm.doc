WARNING: Careless use of this utility can lead to the loss of important data,
directories, and/or program files.  Read the instructions carefully before
using RM.  If files are accidentally deleted on a particular drive, use an
unerase utility to recover the deleted files.  Directories may sometimes be
recovered in a similar way.  Do NOT create or edit any other directories or
files on that drive before recovery of the accidentally deleted material has
been completed.  Unerase and directory unremoval utilities may be found as
public domain or shareware programs on various bulletin board systems.  They
may also be found in commercial software packages such as The Norton Utilities
(TM), The Mace Utilities (TM), or PC-Tools (TM).

Syntax:  RM [/AEFIRSV?] {name | @}...

/A = Remove all matching files, even hidden and system files (these are not 
     normally detected and removed).  If RM is used to remove files in the 
     root directory of a bootable disk, especially a hard disk, /A should not 
     be used with /F as there is a risk of removing the system files 
     IBMBIO.COM (IO.SYS) and IBMDOS.COM (MSDOS.SYS).  This would make it 
     impossible to boot the system from that disk.  

/E = Only delete matching files whose file size is zero.  Normally, we delete 
     matching files regardless of their size.  This option is useful for 
     disposing of empty "junk" files produced by programs or by failed 
     attempts at I/O redirection.  For example, to remove ALL empty files from 
     drive C:, use the command  RM /ES C:\*.*  (/S is explained below).  Note 
     that empty files use up no disk space but they do use up a directory entry.

/F = Force deletion of files without asking.  Normally, we prompt the user for 
     confirmation before removing read-only, hidden, or system files or before 
     assuming "\*.*" at the end of a directory name (see /R below).  If the /F 
     switch is used, these files are removed without any prompt being given.  
     Do NOT use this switch unless you are absolutely sure that you know what 
     you are doing.

/I = Interactive mode: the user is prompted for confirmation before each file 
     is removed, regardless of the file's attributes.  This prompt will look 
     something like:

     Delete C:\COMM\TEMP\RM.DOC  7685  16 Jul 1991  22:43  A-----  [N]? 

     The word "Delete" is followed by the full pathname of the file in 
     question.  Next, the file size and the date and time of last modification 
     are given.  Then the file's attributes are displayed: A = Archive (the 
     file was modified since the last time it was backed up with the DOS 
     BACKUP command), D = Directory and V = Volume label (these two never show 
     up in the prompt), S = System file (part of DOS; if you remove these 
     files you won't be able to boot from that disk), H = Hidden (the file is 
     not displayed by the DOS DIR command), and R = Read-Only (can't be 
     deleted by the DOS DEL command).  Dashes indicate attributes which aren't 
     set.  The "[N]" means that the default response is "NO," so if you press 
     any key other than "Y" or "y" (for "yes") the file will not be deleted.  
     If you press the Esc key, RM will exit to DOS. 

/R = Recursively delete entire subtrees.  Normally, when a directory name 
     appears on the command line it is treated as if "\*.*" was appended to 
     it.  If the /R switch is used, RM will descend through any directory 
     whose name is found on the command line and will remove that directory 
     and all files and subdirectories contained within that directory.  
     Removing the current default directory or any directory which contains 
     the current default directory is not allowed. 

     If /I is also in effect, you will be prompted for confirmation before 
     each directory is examined.  If you do not respond with 'Y' or 'y', that 
     directory will be skipped.

/S = Delete matching files in an entire subtree.  For example, entering 
     RM \UTIL\*.BAK  will delete all files in the \UTIL directory which have 
     the extension .BAK.  Typing  RM /S \UTIL\*.BAK  will delete all .BAK 
     files in the \UTIL directory and all subdirectories of \UTIL.  Typing 
     RM /S *.DOC  will remove all .DOC files in the current default directory 
     and all of its subdirectories.  /S ignores directory names: e.g., if you 
     have a directory called \ASM, then typing RM /S \ASM will do nothing.  To 
     remove all files in \ASM and its subdirectories, type RM /S \ASM\*.*.  
     /S will only remove files, not directories.  Use /R to remove a whole 
     subtree.

/V = Verbose: display the full pathname of each file or directory as it is 
     removed.  Directory names are enclosed in brackets for ease of 
     identification.

/? = Display instructions for using this program

Note: Switches become active as they are encountered on the command line.  If 
      a switch is to affect a given file, it must appear before the file's 
      name on the command line.  Moreover, switches may be combined (e.g. /AI 
      is the same as /A /I).

name = The name of a file or directory to be removed.  Wildcards may be used.

@    = Read a list of names and/or switches from the standard input device and 
       treat each of these as if it had been typed on the command line as an 
       argument of RM.  More than one name and/or switch may appear on each 
       line of input.  When an EOF is encountered, processing of the command 
       line resumes.  

       This feature is useful when used with a file containing a lengthy list 
       of names of files to be deleted.  It may also be used with any program 
       which writes a list of file names to standard output: for example, a 
       program which lists all files in a given directory which have not been 
       modified since a certain date. 

If the environment string VERBOSE exists and has the value ON, then RM will 
act as though the /V switch is in effect even if /V is not included on the 
command line.  If you wish RM to always execute in verbose mode, you may find 
it convenient to include the MS-DOS command  SET VERBOSE=ON  in your 
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

Examples:

The following command will remove all backup (.BAK) files on drive C:

RM /S C:\*.BAK

The following command will remove the directory A:\PASCAL and all files and 
directories contained within A:\PASCAL, prompting the user for confirmation 
before deleting each file:

RM /RI A:\PASCAL

This command will delete all files in the current directory whose names have 
the extension .C or .H or .OBJ:

RM  *.C  *.H  *.OBJ

This command deletes all files whose names are given in the text file DELNAMES:

RM @ <DELNAMES
