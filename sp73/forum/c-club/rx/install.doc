INSTALLATION NOTES

                                                       September 30, 1991
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE:
This is a completly experimental program in it's pre-beta version.
It is not guaranteed to work properly under all circumstances, although
it has been tested for a couple of weeks. Everyone who uses this program
does this on his own risk, so if your machine explodes, don't tell me
you didn't know.

Andreas Gruen releases this software "as is", with no express or
implied warranty, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties
of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.

This program is completly free for everyone.
You can do with it and its sources whatever you want, but it would
be fine to leave my name somewhere in the program or startup-banner.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation: To install rx simply copy the file RX.EXE somewhere where
              it accessable (through PATH or current directory).
              That's it.

NOTES about the source:

RX is written in C so don't try a PASCAL-compiler.
To compile RX you can use the supplied MAKEFILE or simply compile
RX.C, there are no other modules (well, rx.h and rxvar.h must be
present).
RX is written in C so don't try a PASCAL-compiler.

RX uses no (! really) compiler-specific features (to be honest: one,
see below).
So all compilers should accept it.
(RX is written in C so don't try a PASCAL-compiler!)
It should also compile in all memory-models (I tried it, but I haven't
tested it) except the TINY model (.COM-files).
Changing some buffer sizes may solve that problem.

My preferred model is LARGE and I do not want to adapt this program to
any compiler on this world.

There may occur some warnings like:
  possibly incorrect assignment
  variable/parameter not used
  variable assigned a value which is never used

  or equivalent.
  Simply ignore them (there are about 8 of them) or 'correct'
  the source-code.


The one compiler-specific thing is that structures must(!!!) be packed
on byte-boundaries because I'm doing some hard-reads
 (like: fread(a_struct,sizeof(a_struct),1,fp)) so the byte-structure
of the struct has to match the byte-stucture of the file.
(TC2.0 is packing structs by default, MSC6.0 needs the -Zp option)
If your compiler does not support this feature (the program will
hang after printing the line 'Processing ...') you have to
replace these constucts by reading every member of the structs
by hand (have fun).

Be carefully with optimization-switches.
I have made extremly bad experiences (TC2.0 -r switch was
responsible for some wasted hours debugging [not for this program]).
If the program doesn't work: try disabling optimization.

For those who want to know:
  99% of Windows' EXE-file-format is identical with OS/2's format.
  I wrote this program only on informations about the OS/2 format.
  (the resources itselves differ of course).

------------------  CUT HERE  -----------------------------------------

For those who have informations about various file-formats:
==========================================================
I by profession interested in any file-format I can get, because
I'm working at the moment on IMPORT/EXPORT-filters for Lotus-NOTES(tm)
and it is quite difficult to get informations from Germany.
So if you want to gimme some help, send it to me or contact me.
(Address : see READ.ME)

Please note that I have already enough informations on:

EXE
DBF,NDX   (MDX,NTX,IDX,CDX etc. needed)
GIF (87 & 89),TIFF,PCX,WMF,BMP,IMG,ICO (FNT needed)
ARC,ZIP
HPGL,DXF,HP-PCL,Epson(tm)/NEC(tm)Printer-formats


Thanks
