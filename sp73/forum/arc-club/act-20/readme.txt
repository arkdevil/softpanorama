Version Twenty, Archive Comparision Table                  [16 January 1995]
                                                       [ARC-TEST\README.TXT]

This is a comparison test between *36* different archiving programs
available for the IBM-PC & compatibles.  These tests were run on a i486DX/33
with 8MB of RAM, running MS-DOS v6.22.  The PC has 632,656 bytes of
conventional memory free, and 6,963,200 bytes of EMS/XMS memory free.

I have deceided to run these tests using MS-DOS's EMM386.EXE driver, instead
of QEMM, as not every one has QEMM, and it will give fairer result which
everyone can relate to.  Enclosed are a copy of my config.sys and
autoexec.bat files.

The PC is *NOT* running DoubleSpace, Stacker, or any other on-the-fly
compression.  The PC also has over 75MB of hard disk space free.

I am running the test from the DOS command line, and not under Windows.

The PC Tools Pro (For DOS) CPU speed index is 38.4, and the hard disk speed
is 24.5. (Version 9).

The Norton Utilities CPU speed index is 71.9, and the hard disk speed is 9.1
(Version 8).

The timings have been produced using Ultra Precision Command Timer v1.6, by
Erik de Neve, UPCT is a freeware program, easy to use, and only 7K long!

I hope this information is of much use to you as it was to me.  I welcome
[I think <g>] any comments and criticisms about this table.



Acknowledgements!!  I could list all the names of the people that have
contacted me, but this file would double in size!  So I would just like to
say a *BIG* thankyou to everyone that has contacted me.

              produce any of the above archiving programs.

            I have no problems with anyone wishing to reproduce this table,
            but as I have placed a lot of work and effort into producing it,
            all I ask is that you acknowledge the fact that I produced this.

            Thank-you

PS!  If you know the location of a later version of any the above archive
programs, or if you know of a archive program that I have not included,
please could you inform me of their whereabouts, so that I can keep this
table up to date.
