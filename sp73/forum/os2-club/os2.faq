(0.4) Special Report on OS/2 for Windows

{{ On November 9, IBM announced widespread, on-the-shelf availability in the 
United States of its newest software product, OS/2 for Windows.  

OS/2 for Windows is the newest member of the OS/2 family, joining OS/2 2.1 
and OS/2 2.1 Upgrade Edition in satisfying the growing demands of PC users 
for a more powerful yet easy to use environment.  This newest member is 
specifically targeted at current Windows users who are becoming frustrated 
with the limitations of their aging 16-bit operating environment.  It offers 
a smooth, low cost way of upgrading today to take advantage of the future 
technologies that all pundits acknowledge will matter tomorrow.  

OS/2 for Windows is no stripped down sibling; it contains all the features 
found in its bigger brothers.  Those features include true preemptive 
multitasking, multithreading, advanced memory management, Adobe Type 
Manager, the drag-and-drop ease of the object-oriented Workplace Shell (or 
the familiar Windows Program Manager, if desired), state-of-the-art 
multimedia (including the best software motion video technology for the PC), 
support for long filenames through the High Performance File System (HPFS), 
and superb compatibility with DOS, Windows, and OS/2 software.  In fact, 
OS/2 for Windows shares the same base OS/2 2.1 code as its brothers.  

However, IBM has designed OS/2 for Windows to be a true Windows upgrade.  
That means that the Windows compatibility code, Win-OS/2, found in OS/2 2.1 
has been removed.  The installation program has been modified so that OS/2 
for Windows will install over a system which already has DOS 5.x (or later) 
with Microsoft Windows 3.1 installed (including OEM and national language 
versions).  

How does OS/2 for Windows manage to work this magic?  

The installation program in OS/2 for Windows modifies certain Windows files 
just enough so that Windows 3.1 is compatible with the new OS/2 environment.  
However, OS/2 for Windows preserves the existing DOS/Windows setup through 
DualBoot.  In other words, the modified version of Windows 3.1 will still 
execute under regular DOS just as it always did, and OS/2 for Windows will 
let you switch back and forth at will, much as you do now when switching 
between Windows and DOS.  Yet you still use Microsoft's Windows code to run 
your Windows applications regardless of whether you do so under DOS or under 
OS/2 for Windows.  It's like giving your copy of Windows an upgrade without 
getting rid of the old version (should you need it).  

Why is IBM producing a special Windows upgrade?  

IBM is producing OS/2 for Windows for several reasons.  First, since OS/2 
for Windows uses your existing copy of Microsoft Windows 3.1 for Windows 
compatibility, IBM does not have to pay royalties to Microsoft for use of 
the code.  That means that IBM can ship OS/2 for Windows at a lower price 
(with fewer diskettes) than regular OS/2 2.1 -- you do not have to pay twice 
for the same code.  

Moreover, IBM believes there is a large market among Windows users who are 
frustrated with their current environment.  Most of those users do not 
believe that Microsoft's NT (with tremendous hardware requirements and a 
price tag of $300 and up) is a viable upgrade, and many of those users are 
not willing to wait until Microsoft attempts to offer equivalent 
functionality some time in the future.  

What media sizes are available, and how much will OS/2 for Windows cost?  

OS/2 for Windows is available in four packages:  3.5 inch diskettes (IBM 
Part No.  71G5391), 5.25 inch diskettes (71G5392), CD-ROM (71G5395), and 
without media (additional license certificate, 71G5397).  Street prices in 
the United States are expected to be $49 to $59 for either of the diskette 
packages, $39 to $49 for the CD-ROM package, and $29 to $39 for an 
additional license.  (You would pay more for a Windows desktop replacement 
or accessory!)  

At those prices, what about toll free technical support?  

IBM will provide exactly the same toll free technical support to OS/2 for 
Windows customers as it does its regular OS/2 customers, that is, 60 days of 
toll free technical support per copy purchased starting from the first call.  
(Outside the United States, support policies may differ.)  In addition, all 
the other support vehicles are available indefinitely (such as BBSes, 
CompuServe, etc).  

Will OS/2 for Windows support "seamless" mode?  Enhanced mode?  VxDs?  
Win32s?  

While operating under OS/2 for Windows, both "seamless" and enhanced modes 
are supported.  (Seamless Windows is the ability to execute Windows 
applications on the OS/2 Workplace Shell desktop.  Enhanced mode is the 
default Windows mode on 386 or higher processors and is required by certain 
Windows applications.)  VxDs, or Windows virtual drivers, are not supported 
while executing under OS/2 for Windows and, by implication, neither is 
Win32s.  Only a tiny number (four at last count) of applications require one 
or both of these features.  (Microsoft NT, in fact, does not support VxDs at 
all.)  Again, OS/2 for Windows preserves an existing Windows 3.1 setup, so 
such applications, if absolutely necessary, can be run under DOS/Windows.  
On the other hand, OS/2 for Windows allows Windows users to run any of the 
thousands of OS/2 applications available (none of which are available to 
users running DOS with Windows, NT, or any other environment except OS/2).  

Should VxD and/or Win32s support become important in the future, IBM has 
stated that it will support these technologies.  

If I do not have a copy of Microsoft Windows 3.1, can I install OS/2 for 
Windows and use it to run DOS and OS/2 applications?  

Yes!  While OS/2 for Windows is designed primarily for people upgrading from 
Windows, it will install if you have DOS alone on your hard disk.  You will 
not be able to run Windows applications within OS/2 for Windows, however.  
When used as a DOS upgrade, you might think of OS/2 for Windows as "OS/2 
WOW":  OS/2 WithOut Windows.  

If I install OS/2 for Windows on a DOS-only system, and I later decide I 
need support for Windows applications, can I install Windows 3.1?  

Yes!  When you install OS/2 for Windows on a DOS-only system, the DualBoot 
facility (for switching between native DOS and OS/2 for Windows) is provided 
by default.  To add Windows 3.1 to a system with OS/2 for Windows already 
installed, simply DualBoot into native DOS, install Windows 3.1, DualBoot 
back into OS/2 for Windows, then use Selective Install to "migrate" Windows 
3.1.  (Precise instructions should be available in the OS/2 for Windows 
package.)  

If I have to install OS/2 for Windows over a DOS/Windows system, how do I 
use HPFS?  

OS/2 for Windows itself may be installed on a High Performance File System 
(HPFS) formatted volume, but Windows 3.1 must reside on a DOS File 
Allocation Table (FAT) volume (since DOS cannot read and write to HPFS).  
Since DOS (and Windows when it is installed and running under DOS) requires 
a FAT (File Allocation Table) file system, and since OS/2 for Windows needs 
the existing Windows code on your hard disk to provide Windows application 
compatibility, the part of your hard disk which holds Windows 3.1 must be 
FAT.  Other parts of your hard disk (including the section holding OS/2 for 
Windows itself) may be formatted to HPFS if you wish.  If you have no 
intention of ever running Windows 3.1 under native DOS, you can back up any 
FAT volumes (using OS/2 backup software), repartition/reformat for HPFS, 
then restore.  (This procedure is recommended only for those users who are 
reasonably familiar with OS/2.)  

Can I still use OS/2's Boot Manager?  

Yes, Boot Manager may be used provided there is unpartitioned space 
available on the hard disk.  Repartitioning may be required (using the FDISK 
utility supplied with OS/2 for Windows) if this is not the case.  

Can I still use MS-DOS's DoubleSpace?  

IBM recommends that DoubleSpace users either (a) move files off DoubleSpace 
drives completely and get rid of DoubleSpace, or (b) purchase Stacker for 
OS/2 and DOS along with OS/2 for Windows, to provide on-the-fly disk 
compression under both environments (and allow conversion of DoubleSpace 
volumes).  Users may keep DoubleSpace compressed files, but such files will 
not be accessible while inside OS/2 for Windows.  

Are there any extra drivers included with OS/2 for Windows?  

Yes.  With OS/2 2.1, users of S3-based video cards have to download a driver 
disk for support.  The S3 driver diskette is included inside the OS/2 for 
Windows box.  

Will OS/2 for Windows require separate Service Paks?  

No.  OS/2 for Windows will use the same Service Paks, when available, as 
OS/2 2.1.  See (4.6) Corrective Service Diskettes for more information.  

I already have OS/2 2.1.  What does OS/2 for Windows do for me?  

There are minimal functional differences.  OS/2 for Windows brings the power 
of OS/2 in a lower cost package to a key audience.  Windows users are now 
even more inclined to experience OS/2 technology for themselves.  The most 
substantial difference is that the "About" dialog boxes in Windows, even 
when running under OS/2 for Windows, still say Microsoft (and do not betray 
IBM influence as those in Win-OS/2 do).  So, if you have regular OS/2 2.1 or 
OS/2 2.1 Upgrade Edition, relax and watch as a new wave of new users join 
you in the OS/2 world.  For future purchases, you may wish to consider OS/2 
for Windows (as either a DOS or Windows upgrade).  

Will there be an upgrade to OS/2 for Windows from regular OS/2 2.1 or OS/2 
2.1 Upgrade Edition?  

No.  OS/2 for Windows is another member of the OS/2 family and is designed 
primarily as an upgrade for Windows users (and for DOS users who are not 
concerned about Windows compatibility).  It is not an upgrade (nor for that 
matter a downgrade) for OS/2 2.1 users.  

What will happen to regular OS/2 2.1 and OS/2 2.1 Upgrade Edition?  

Both regular OS/2 2.1 and OS/2 2.1 Upgrade Edition will continue to be sold 
alongside OS/2 for Windows (possibly in even greater numbers than before).  
Regular OS/2 2.1 is designed as IBM's premier operating system for new PCs 
-- PCs purchased without any operating system whatsoever.  OS/2 2.1 Upgrade 
Edition is intended for those PC users who do not have a copy of Microsoft 
Windows 3.1 but who run DOS or for those who are running a previous version 
of OS/2.  Both regular OS/2 2.1 and OS/2 2.1 Upgrade Edition include 
built-in Windows application support (Win-OS/2).  (OS/2 2.1 is also slightly 
more convenient for those users who wish to run with only HPFS, or for those 
users at larger sites who perform such tasks as OS/2 remote installation and 
maintenance.)  

How do I order OS/2 for Windows?  

IBM will sell OS/2 for Windows directly through its toll free telephone 
number (800-3-IBM-OS2), but you really ought to ask your local software 
vendor (Egghead, Software Etc., Babbages, or wherever) for a copy.  Prices 
from dealers should be lower than those offered by IBM directly.  
Availability will vary by country, so consult your local IBM dealer if you 
happen to live outside the United States.  }}

What is OS/2?  

OS/2 is an advanced operating system for PCs and PS/2s with an 80286 
processor or better.  It was codeveloped by Microsoft and IBM and envisioned 
as the successor to DOS.  

It was designed from the ground up with preemptive multitasking and 
multithreading in mind.  "Preemptive multitasking" means that the operating 
system is responsible for allocating processor time to the one or more 
applications which are running.  (Cooperative multitasking, as found in 
Microsoft Windows or the Macintosh's System 7, requires that each 
application surrender the processor after a certain amount of time.  If one 
application refuses to yield, all the other applications stop running.)  
"Multithreading" means that programs can start subtasks which will then be 
executed by the operating system in the background.  For example, a word 
processor may create a separate thread (subtask) to handle printing or 
saving to disk.  When the user asks the word processor to perform one of 
these tasks, the word processor creates a new thread and control returns to 
the word processor (and the user) immediately.  The subtask is executed by 
the operating system in the background.  The user is then free to ask the 
word processor to perform another task without waiting for the thread to 
complete.  Applications which utilitize multithreading can be much more 
responsive to the user.  

OS/2 also protects applications from one another (a single misbehaved 
program will not typically disrupt the entire system), supports all 
addressable physical RAM, and supplies virtual memory to applications as 
requested, breaking DOS's 640K barrier.  

An OS/2 demonstration diskette (which will run on any PC with VGA or better, 
and DOS or OS/2) is available from IBM by calling 800-3-IBM-OS2.  The OS/2 
2.1 demo diskette may also be downloaded; see (3.2) Shareware and Freeware 
Sources.

(1.2) Differences Between Versions

What are the differences between versions?  

o IBM OS/2 Version 2.1 is the latest release of OS/2, offering Windows 3.1 
compatibility, multimedia support (including software motion video), and 
more device drivers.  With Version 2.1 IBM has ended the practice of 
including extra features in its own, preinstalled versions of OS/2 2.0 that 
were not found in the off-the-shelf package.  {{ See (0.4) Special Report on 
OS/2 for Windows for details on the new, lower cost member of the OS/2 2.1 
family.  }} 

o IBM OS/2 Version 2.0 is the first release of OS/2 which will run only on 
machines with an 80386SX processor or better.  With this release IBM started 
developing OS/2 (and its Intel and non-Intel-based successors) independently 
but continued to involve third party PC manufacturers in its testing.  
Improvements included an object-oriented Workplace Shell (WPS); a multiple 
operating system boot mechanism; better DOS and Windows support [See (1.3) 
DOS and Windows Compatibility]; new 32-bit programming interfaces; support 
for more than 16 MB of physical RAM [See (2.6) More Than 16 MB RAM]; and 
more third party device drivers.  OS/2 1.x applications, unmodified, still 
run under OS/2 2.0.  

o IBM OS/2 Version 1.3 is the last release of OS/2 to operate on PCs with 
80286 CPUs.  This version introduced built-in Adobe Type Manager (ATM) [See 
(5.5) Adobe Type Manager], providing scalable typefaces for screen and 
printer.  Procedures Language/2 (REXX), a powerful batch-oriented 
programming language, became a part of Standard Edition with this release.  
[See (5.11) REXX.] (A few OEMs are shipping Microsoft OS/2 Version 1.3, but 
Microsoft has ceded all OS/2 development to IBM.)  

o OS/2 Version 1.2 was the first to incorporate the High Performance File 
System (HPFS) [See (1.5) High Performance File System].  With this release 
IBM OS/2 added a dual boot mechanism and IBM Extended Edition [See (3.9) 
Extended Services] introduced REXX.  

o OS/2 Version 1.1 was the first to include the Presentation Manager (PM) 
GUI/API.  Microsoft OEM versions added a dual boot mechanism with this 
release.  

o OS/2 Version 1.0, introduced in late 1987, was the first release of OS/2.  
Task switching was accomplished using a character-based shell and limited 
DOS compatibility was provided.

(1.3) DOS and Windows Compatibility

How good is OS/2 2.1's DOS and Windows compatibility?  

OS/2 1.x [See (1.2) Differences Between Versions] justifiably earned a 
reputation for poor DOS compatibility.  Since it was hampered by the 80286, 
it could not run more than one DOS application at a time.  

The situation changed dramatically with OS/2 2.0, and Version 2.1 adds 
further refinements.  Version 2.1 preemptively multitasks DOS and Windows 
(standard and enhanced mode) applications in separate, protected sessions, 
without purchasing either environment.  

OS/2 2.1 provides a complete DOS emulation equivalent to DOS 5.0.  The 
operating system can provide each DOS application with up to 32 MB of EMS 
4.0 (expanded memory), 16 MB of XMS 2.0 (extended memory), and/or 512 MB of 
DPMI 0.95 (DOS Protected Mode Interface extended memory), all from its pool 
of physical and/or virtual memory (meaning you do not have to have as much 
RAM in your system as your applications request).  These limits are in 
addition to the up to 730K free conventional memory supplied to each DOS 
application, even after mouse and network drivers [See (3.8) Networking 
Products] are loaded.  As in DOS 5.0, DOS code and device drivers may be 
loaded into high memory.  A 386 memory manager like QEMM is not needed -- 
these features are provided by OS/2 2.1 directly.  

The DOS emulation allows customization of device driver sets -- each DOS 
application shares a systemwide CONFIG.SYS and the equivalent of its own 
CONFIG.SYS.  Also, there is a systemwide AUTOEXEC.BAT file; however, batch 
commands particular to each DOS application can be invoked using separate, 
application-specific AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  And many DOS Settings are provided 
to fine tune [See (5.6) Performance Tuning] each DOS/Windows application's 
behavior (e.g.  IDLE_SENSITIVITY).  Most of the popular DOS/Windows 
applications on your hard disk will be migrated automatically when you 
install OS/2 2.1.  

In addition, OS/2 2.1 will boot one or more specific versions of DOS in 
separate sessions, to assist in running particularly difficult applications 
(e.g.  DOS networks, MSCDEX and CD-ROM drivers).  So, for example, it is 
possible to multitask DOS 3.3, DOS 4.0, DOS 5.0, {{ DOS 6.0, DOS 6.2, 
DR-DOS, }} emulated DOS, and Desqview running atop DOS, all in separate 
sessions, either windowed or full screen, all with the same and/or separate 
device drivers, TSRs, environment variables, etc.  DOS boot images may be 
stored on a hard disk.  These procedures are described in the online Command 
Reference (under VMDISK), Master Help Index, and in the Installation Guide 
(Appendix E).  [See also (5.9) Specific DOS Sessions.] 

Standard graphics modes [generally up to the resolution of the desktop; See 
(2.2) SuperVGA Support] are supported in DOS windows, as are selectable text 
mode fonts.  Cut/paste to/from windowed DOS applications is supported 
(to/from other DOS, OS/2, and Windows applications), including graphics 
cut/paste.  Theoretically, OS/2 2.1 can run up to 240 simultaneous 
DOS/Windows sessions; the practical maximum depends on system resources.  

OS/2 2.1 will, in fact, run virtually all DOS applications in existence, 
including notorious ones such as Microsoft Flight Simulator, Wing Commander, 
Maple, MatLab (Version 3.5k or later), {{ AutoCAD (Release 12 requires 
maintenance version C2 or later), }} and others.  Those that do not run 
generally fall into the following categories:  

1. Programs that use Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI) memory 
extenders or other extenders which require direct access to 80386 control 
registers.  Since such applications are also all but incompatible with 
Windows, most vendors have updates for DPMI compatibility; 

2. Applications which attempt to directly address the physical sectors of an 
OS/2 managed nonremoveable hard disk drive.  Such programs include UnErase 
in Norton Utilities [See (3.4) Disk Utilities].  Fortunately OS/2 2.1 has a 
built-in UnDelete feature which is more robust than Norton's approach.  
(Consult the online Command Reference for information on how to enable 
UNDELETE); 

3. Timing sensitive DOS applications.  Certain DOS programs that generate 
digitized sound through the PC's internal speaker may have distorted sound.  
High speed, real time data collection may be compromised.  These problems 
can often be minimized or even eliminated using OS/2 2.1's DOS Settings.  

4. Certain DOS programming debuggers.  DOS applications running under OS/2 
2.1 are not permitted to access debug registers DR0-DR7 from a DOS session.  
Also, DOS debuggers will not be able to set hardware breakpoints, and all 
read/write operations to debug registers in virtual 8086 mode will be 
ignored.  
  
See (3.11) Backup Software for information on OS/2 backup issues.  

DOS-based disk caching software is not required since OS/2 includes a 
built-in, highly configurable, efficient disk cache.  Also, the OS/2 CD-ROM 
file system's cache may be adjusted; see the online Command Reference for 
details.  

DOS programs running under OS/2 2.1 are extremely fast.  A single DOS 
application (no other applications open) running full screen under OS/2 2.1 
typically achieves 95-97% of the performance it would have under native DOS.  
If the DOS application performs any disk I/O it can actually operate up to 
several times faster than it would if running under native DOS.  

If pure DOS is absolutely required, OS/2 2.1 includes a utility called the 
Boot Manager.  The Boot Manager can provide a listing of all the operating 
systems available on the system and will allow selection of any one at 
startup, with a default after timeout.  The OS/2 DualBoot method (to switch 
between DOS and OS/2 only) is still available as well.  Consult the 
Installation Guide for instructions on how to use Boot Manager or DualBoot.  
Note that OS/2 2.1 need not be installed on Drive C -- it can reside on 
other volumes [See (4.3) Hard Disk Partitioning].  

Compatibility with Windows, a popular DOS extender, is provided by Win-OS/2, 
an environment based on Microsoft's Windows source code.  It runs Windows 
3.x enhanced mode and standard mode applications under OS/2 2.1, either on a 
full screen Windows desktop (with the familiar Program Manager and one or 
more Windows applications) or "seamlessly," alongside OS/2 applications on 
the Workplace Shell desktop.  "Seamless" operation is available in VGA, many 
SuperVGA, 8514/A, and XGA resolutions with OS/2 2.1 as it ships.  [See (2.2) 
SuperVGA Support.] 

Several icon conversion utilities can convert Windows icons for use by the 
OS/2 Icon Editor and/or OS/2-specific programs [See (3.2) Shareware and 
Freeware Sources].  (No conversion is necessary if the icons are to be used 
with Windows programs running under OS/2 2.1.)  

OS/2 2.1 directly provides all Windows enhanced mode features save one:  
support for Windows virtual drivers (VxD).  Only two major applications are 
affected:  MathCAD 4.0 and Microsoft Visual C++.  Services provided by 
WINMEM32.DLL are supported.  

Windows applications are well integrated into the overall OS/2 Workplace 
Shell environment with DDE and Clipboard hooks, and OLE (Object Linking and 
Embedding) is supported among Windows applications.  Adobe Type Manager [See 
(5.5) Adobe Type Manager] and TrueType for Win-OS/2 comes with OS/2 2.1.  
Windows screen (for a full screen desktop) and printer device drivers will 
work under Win-OS/2 [See (2.2) SuperVGA Support].  Such notorious Windows 
applications as Word, Norton Desktop (save portions described above), 
Toolbook, and After Dark work fine under Win-OS/2.  Even applications which 
rely on the Windows Multimedia Extensions (supplied as part of Win-OS/2) 
operate without trouble.  [See (3.6) Multimedia for information on the OS/2 
multimedia extensions, MMPM/2.] All the Windows applets (except those made 
redundant by OS/2's applets) are provided.  

Win-OS/2 departs from Microsoft Windows in that it allows more than one 
Windows desktop and can preemptively (rather than cooperatively) multitask 
Windows applications in separate, robust, protected sessions, at the user's 
option.  Also, both DOS and OS/2 applications can be started from the 
Win-OS/2 Program Manager.  

Some Windows applications require custom settings in WIN.INI.  If such a 
Windows application has been installed under the DOS version of Windows, 
Win-OS/2 may not be able to find the appropriate files or configuration.  
Try reinstalling the Windows application under Win-OS/2.  (Note that several 
options are available for Win-OS/2 interaction with the Windows INI files.  
For example, the Windows INI files may be migrated during installation.  Or 
both Win-OS/2 and Windows can share a single set of INI files.)  

In short, OS/2 2.1 is generally regarded as the most DOS and Windows 
compatible among the new crop of 32-bit operating systems (NT included).  It 
is also generally regarded as a better DOS multitasker than Desqview.

(1.4) Availability and Cost of OS/2

Where can I buy OS/2, and how much does it cost?  

In the United States IBM OS/2 Version 2.1 is available directly from IBM by 
calling 800-3-IBM-OS2.  {{ Call for the latest information on pricing -- 
promotional pricing may be in effect.  Diskette versions (5.25 or 3.5 inch 
media) are typically priced lower than the CD-ROM version (which contains 
only only the CD-ROM plus 5.25 inch and 3.5 inch "bootstrap" diskettes), and 
an Upgrade Edition is available.  Express shipping is provided with all 
orders placed through this toll free number.  }} 

IBM part numbers are as follows:  61G0900 for 3.5 inch media, 61G0902 for 
3.5 inch media Upgrade Edition, 61G0901 for 5.25 inch media, 61G0903 for 
5.25 inch media Upgrade Edition, 61G0904 for compact disc, 71G1877 for 
compact disc Upgrade Edition.  An additional license certificate (no media 
or manuals) is 61G0910; an additional license Upgrade Edition certificate is 
61G0911.  

However, OS/2 2.1 is now available from almost any software dealer 
(including Corporate Software, Egghead, Software Etc., and many others).  
Software dealer pricing is lower than that available directly from IBM -- 
often $10 or $20 lower.  

Additional license certificates are available for second and subsequent 
copies.  {{ Note that each OS/2 CD-ROM or diskette package }} includes a set 
of OS/2 manuals and 60 days (per package) of toll free technical support.  
An additional license certificate does not come with either.  

These prices mean that OS/2 2.1 costs about the same as Microsoft Windows 
for DOS and roughly one fifth to one third as much as the base (not server) 
versions of Windows NT, NeXTStep, Solaris, and UnixWare.  

In Canada phone 800-465-1234 to order.  In the U.K.  phone the OS/2 User 
Group at 0285-655888 or IBM at 0256-841818 or 0800-919-929.  In other 
countries, contact any IBM dealer or office.  Pricing varies from country to 
country.  

IBM OS/2 Version 1.3 is still available and may be ordered through many IBM 
dealers.  

IBM is trying to make OS/2 2.1 available everywhere DOS is purchased.  If 
your dealer does not stock OS/2 2.1, take your business elsewhere (and 
explain why).  IBM bundles OS/2 2.1 with some PS/1, most ValuePoint, and all 
386SX (and above) PS/2 systems, {{ as requested.  }} Several other vendors, 
including AST, Compaq, Everex, Northgate, ALR, Unisys, Dell, Ariel Design, 
and Tangent, will preload OS/2 2.1 on request.  

IBM offers two money back guarantees in the U.S.:  a 30-day, no questions 
asked, money back guarantee, and a 90-day compatibility guarantee [See (2.1) 
Hardware Requirements].

(1.5) High Performance File System (HPFS)

Why should I use HPFS?  What does it offer me?  Does it work with DOS?  

{{ HPFS is an installable file system (IFS) provided with OS/2 which may 
optionally be used instead of (or alongside) the standard DOS-style FAT 
(File Allocation Table) file system.  }} HPFS offers long file names (up to 
254 characters including the path, greatly exceeding the "8 dot 3" limit in 
DOS's FAT file system), contiguous storage of extended attributes (without 
the EA DATA.  SF file used by FAT), resistance to file fragmentation, 
improved media error handling, smaller cluster size, support for larger file 
storage devices (up to 512 GB), and speedier disk operation, particularly on 
large hard disks, on systems with more than 6 MB of RAM.  HPFS is not case 
sensitive, although it does preserve case in file names.  

However, HPFS is not currently supported on removeable media, although some 
programs (e.g.  BACKUP) preserve long file names on such FAT disks.  Also, 
native mode DOS cannot access a HPFS partition.  However, DOS/Windows 
sessions running under OS/2 can use all files that conform to the "8 dot 3" 
naming conventions, even if they are stored on HPFS volumes.  {{ (FAT is not 
required for compatibility with DOS and Windows applications.)  }}

(2.0) Hardware

The following questions are addressed in this section:  

 (2.1)  What hardware do I need to run IBM OS/2 2.1?  Do I need a PS/2?

 (2.2)  Will OS/2 2.1 work with my SuperVGA adapter? 

 (2.3)  Will OS/2 2.1 work with my printer? 

 (2.4)  Can I use COM3 and COM4 in OS/2 2.1? 

 (2.5)  Are there any specific hardware recommendations? 

 (2.6)  Can I use more than 16 MB of RAM? 

 (2.7)  What device drivers are available that aren't included with OS/2? 


(2.1) Hardware Requirements

What hardware do I need to run IBM OS/2 2.1?  Do I need a PS/2?  

You need any ISA (AT bus), EISA, VESA LocalBus, {{ PCI, }} or Microchannel 
PC compatible with at least an 80386SX CPU, 4 MB (6 MB or more strongly 
recommended) of RAM, a 60 MB or larger hard disk (with 15-37 MB free, 
depending on which features you wish to install), a supported video adapter 
(CGA, EGA, VGA, many SuperVGA, 8514/A, XGA, or third party driver) with 
appropriate display, and a high density 3.5 or 5.25 inch floppy drive for 
installation.  A mouse or other pointing device is strongly recommended.  
Allow extra RAM and hard disk space for OS/2-based networking [See (3.8) 
Networking Products], Extended Services [See (3.9) Extended Services], 
and/or extra system loads (i.e.  an extraordinary number of large 
applications running simultaneously).  When calculating hard disk space 
requirements, subtract space occupied by files already on the hard disk 
which are functionally included in OS/2 2.1 and may be deleted, e.g.  DOS, a 
386 memory manager, Windows 3.1, Adobe Type Manager [See (5.5) Adobe Type 
Manager] with base typefaces, etc.  

{{ The performance of OS/2 itself will not be increased appreciably with the 
addition of a math coprocessor.  However, certain applications may benefit.  
}} 

The Workplace Shell (WPS) will not operate with the Monochrome Display 
Adapter or the Hercules Monochrome Graphics Adapter.  Usually the WPS will 
fail to work with monochrome EGA.  However, some EGA adapters (e.g.  
Paradise Monochrome EGA Card, ATI EGA Wonder) will emulate all color EGA 
modes on TTL monochrome monitors and, thus, will work with the WPS.  

The following dual monitor configurations are supported:  VGA or most 
SuperVGA with Monochrome Display Adapter (not Hercules), 8514/A with VGA, 
XGA with VGA, and XGA with one or more other XGA.  A secondary monitor is 
most often used with code debuggers that explicitly support such 
configurations.  The Workplace Shell desktop is currently shown only on the 
primary display (except for the STB MVP-2 and MVP-4 ISA and Microchannel 
display adapters which do support the Workplace Shell desktop spanning 
multiple monitors -- contact STB at 214-234-8750 or FAX 214-234-1306 for 
more information; {{ and the Double Edge video card from Nth Graphics, phone 
800-624-7552 }}).  

OS/2 specifically supports hard drive adapters which conform to the Western 
Digital chipset interface standard (nearly all MFM, RLL, IDE, and ESDI 
adapters) and Adaptec, Future Domain, DPT, and IBM SCSI adapters.  [True 
OS/2 2.1 drivers for most SCSI adapters, e.g.  {{ Always, }} Trantor, 
Rancho, Procomp, Corel Systems, BusLogic, Seagate, Mylex, CE Infosys, 
Ciprico, MediaVision ProAudio Spectrum, and others are available directly 
from the adapter manufacturers or from (3.2) Shareware and Freeware 
Sources.] In addition, "generic" INT13 support is provided for all other 
hard disk adapters.  This "generic" support even embraces such devices as 
Iomega's Bernoulli and SyQuest's removeable media products (but for best 
results contact Iomega or SyQuest for an OS/2 2.1 driver).

with native OS/2 2.1 support.  The OS/2 CD-ROM support includes audio, ISO 
9660/High Sierra, CD-ROM/XA, and Kodak Photo CD compatibility for those 
drives which support these standards.  

Drivers for non-SCSI Sony CD-ROM drives (e.g.  CDU-535, CDU-31A, and related 
models), {{ Creative Labs/Panasonic CD-ROM drives, and later model Mitsumi 
drives }} are available from several sources [See (3.2) Shareware and 
Freeware Sources].  Drivers for Mitsumi CD-ROM drives (and compatibles, e.g.  
Tandy CDR-1000 and DAK) are {{ also }} available from either Systems 
Integration Technologies (BBS 305-979-1976 or netmail 
76130.2321@compuserve.com) or Totronik (49-711-244272, FAX 49-711-6406815 or 
netmail 100064.1346@compuserve.com).  Drivers for non-SCSI Hitachi CD-ROM 
models are available by calling either Laser Resources (800-535-2737) or 
Proline (415-692-5262); ask for CDREXT5D.  A Philips CD-ROM driver is 
available from Aha Computers (49-4531-17070 or FAX 49-4531-170737).  Storage 
Devices offers OS/2 drivers for its parallel port attached peripherals, 
including its CD-ROM drive.  Corel Systems offers a set of OS/2 drivers (in 
its "Corel SCSI" package) for many more CD-ROM drives, magneto-optical 
drives, and other SCSI devices when attached to any of a number of SCSI 
adapters.  DOS device drivers, when installed using a specific DOS session 
[See (5.9) Specific DOS Sessions], will still provide CD-ROM services to 
DOS/Windows programs for the remainder.

compatibility.  

Version 2.1 is explicitly supported on non-IBM PC compatibles.  IBM is 
offering a money back compatibility guarantee in the U.S.  Should OS/2 2.1 
fail to work on your compatible within the first 90 days of use, and should 
IBM be unable to fix the problem, your purchase price will be refunded.  To 
date over 750 non-IBM models have been tested in IBM's own labs.

(2.2) SuperVGA Support

Will OS/2 2.1 work with my SuperVGA adapter?  

Consult the OS/2 2.1 Installation Guide and Using the Operating System 
manuals for complete information on SuperVGA support.  

OS/2 2.1 contains built-in 256 color drivers for most SuperVGA adapters 
based on the following chipsets:  

  o ATI 28800 
  o Cirrus Logic CL-GD5422 and CL-GD5424 
  o Headland Technologies HT209 
  o IBM VGA256C 
  o Trident Microsystems TVGA8900B and TVGA8900C 
  o Tseng Labs ET4000 
  o Western Digital/Paradise WD90C11, WD90C30, and WD90C31 (in WD90C30 mode) 
  
Some SuperVGA adapters (notably ATI's Vantage and Ultra lines) are 8514/A 
hardware compatible and will function in 1024x768 256 color mode with OS/2's 
built-in 8514/A driver.  

Drivers for other SuperVGA adapters (along with installation instructions), 
and modified versions of the built-in drivers (such as 16 color versions or 
small icon versions) should be available from the adapter vendors directly 
or through (3.2) Shareware and Freeware Sources.  In addition, IBM has 
released a set of drivers for SuperVGA adapters based on S3 chipsets to 
these public sources.  (However, certain S3-based adapters require custom 
drivers from vendors.)  

Regular Windows 3.1 display drivers may be used for the full screen Win-OS/2 
desktop.  To install a Windows 3.1 display driver under Win-OS/2, simply 
replace the \OS2\MDOS\WINOS2\SYSTEM\VGA.DRV file with the Windows .DRV file 
supplied by the vendor.  (Be sure to make a copy of the original 
OS/2-supplied driver file first.)  Note that you may have to use the EXPAND 
program supplied with Win-OS/2 to decompress the vendor's .DRV file.  

OS/2 2.1 has now routinized the procedure for setting customized refresh 
rates using DOS-based utilities (such as VMODE).  You will be prompted 
during installation of a SuperVGA driver, and you can specify the DOS 
utility you wish to execute along with its parameters (if any).  You may 
also need to invoke the utility in your OS/2 AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that DOS 
sessions are properly configured to your monitor's specifications.  Read the 
OS/2 manuals carefully for details on how to use the DSPINSTL program to 
install SuperVGA drivers and customize refresh rates for your monitor.  
[Note that for SuperVGA adapters based on the Tseng 4000 chipset ONLY you 
may use the command SVGA MONITOR from any full screen DOS session to 
customize refresh rates for your particular monitor.]

(2.3) Printer Support

Will OS/2 2.1 work with my printer?  

OS/2 2.1 includes support for Hewlett-Packard LaserJets (including the 
LaserJet 4 series), DeskJets (including the new 1200C and 510 models), and 
PaintJets; IBM/Lexmark ExecJets, InkJets, Proprinters, Quickwriters, 
Quietwriters, Pageprinters, and Laserprinters; Epson dot matrix, ink jet, 
and laser printers; Postscript devices; and other printers (e.g.  Panasonic, 
Okidata) compatible with these families.  A variety of IBM and HP plotters 
(including HPGL/2 plotters) is also supported.  Drivers for NEC dot matrix 
printers and Canon laser and BubbleJet printers are now available for 
download [See (3.2) Shareware and Freeware Sources or contact the Canon 
Support BBS at 714-438-3325].  Most BubbleJet printers also work quite well 
with either the IBM 4072 ExecJet or IBM {{ 4070 }} InkJet driver.  If your 
printer model is not listed when you install OS/2 2.1, consult your Using 
the Operating System manual starting on Page 351 for advice.  Or check your 
printer's manual to see if the printer emulates one of the models that is 
listed.  

DOS/Windows printer drivers continue to work for DOS/Windows applications.  
OS/2 2.1 includes a large assortment of Windows printer drivers for 
Win-OS/2.  If necessary install Windows printer drivers using the Win-OS/2 
Control Panel.  OS/2 2.1 and OS/2 1.3 printer drivers are interchangeable in 
many cases.  

If your printer is not compatible with one of the drivers supplied with 
OS/2, check with the printer manufacturer first then with (3.2) Shareware 
and Freeware Sources.  If you own an IBM printer, check with the Lexmark BBS 
(modem 606-232-5653).  Drivers for older IBM printers (including the 
original IBM 5152 Graphics Printer) are available from (3.2) Shareware and 
Freeware Sources.  

If you are using a Postscript printer, and you are having difficulty 
printing under Win-OS/2 3.1, particularly over a network, try adding the 
following line to the Postscript section of your WIN.INI file:  

 CtrlD=0 

If you are having trouble printing generally, see the configuration advice 
in (4.1) Installation for assistance.

(2.4) COM3 and COM4

Can I use COM3 and COM4 in OS/2?  

COM3 and COM4 are supported on most PS/2s without any additional effort.  On 
ISA, EISA, {{ PCI, }} and VESA LocalBus machines, some additions are 
required to CONFIG.SYS.  Using a text editor, include "(port number, base 
address, interrupt number)" parameters next to the COM.SYS and VCOM.SYS 
filenames.  One example:  
 
 DEVICE=C:\OS2\COM.SYS (3,3E8,5) (4,2E8,10)
 DEVICE=C:\OS2\MDOS\VCOM.SYS (3,3E8,5) (4,2E8,10)
 
Parameters for COM1 and COM2 need not be included (unless they are somehow 
nonstandard).  OS/2 must end up with sequentially numbered logical COM 
ports, if possible.  For example, if (physical) port two is not installed 
but port three or port four is installed, start numbering using (2,...)  in 
the DEVICE lines.  See the OS/2 2.1 Using the Operating System manual, 
starting on Page 374, for more information on COM ports under OS/2.  If 
these efforts fail, try the SIO drivers [available from (3.2) Shareware and 
Freeware Sources].  Note that IRQ 2 is actually redirected to IRQ 9 on the 
AT bus, so use (...,...,9) in the above COM.SYS and VCOM.SYS settings if 
your serial port is set to use IRQ 2. 

AT bus COM ports cannot be used at the same time if they share interrupts 
because of bus design limitations (cf.  "Under the Hood:  How Interrupts 
Work," Byte, February, 1992).  An adapter which provides more flexibility in 
interrupt selection [e.g.  the 16-bit model from STB; See (2.5) Specific 
Hardware Recommendations] may prove helpful.  Also, PolyCom, a replacement 
driver available from (3.2) Shareware and Freeware Sources, supports up to 
eight ports with the right hardware (Xenix-compatible multiport adapters).  

"Smart" (coprocessor controlled) multiport communication adapters should be 
used when installing more than four ports.  Such an adapter will work with 
OS/2 if the manufacturer has written an appropriate driver.  Examples

(2.5) Specific Hardware Recommendations

Are there any specific hardware recommendations?  

Here are some of the peripherals and adapters that are particularly well 
suited to OS/2.  Some true bargains are included.  Prices do not include 
shipping and handling.  

o S3-based Display Adapters.  {{ Since IBM has produced high resolution 
device drivers for video cards based on S3 chipsets, there are many S3 cards 
which work well under OS/2.  Choose one based on either the S3 801 or 928 
chipset.  Orchid, Diamond, Actix, and Number Nine all manufacture S3-based 
display adapters with varying capabilities and prices.  }} 

o Toshiba 3201 CD-ROM Drives.  {{ R.S.T.  Computer Services (phone 
603-595-8708 or FAX 603-889-5250) is selling Toshiba 3201 external CD-ROM 
drives for just $200.  These drives feature a data transfer rate of 
150K/second and an average access time of 380 ms.  }} 

o NEC CD-ROM Drives.  ITG Computers (tel.  708-259-1129 or FAX 708-259-1130) 
is selling NEC CDR-73 ($225), CDR-83 ($205), CDR-74 ($315), and CDR-84 
($295) SCSI CD-ROM drives.  The CDR-73 (external) and CDR-83 (internal) 
feature an average access time of about 350 ms and a 150K/second data 
transfer rate.  The CDR-74 (external) and CDR-84 (internal) increase the 
data transfer rate to 300K/second and add Kodak Photo CD compatibility.  
Some models are refurbished.  Or you may wish to order the CDR-37 (portable, 
caddyless, 150K/second, 450 ms, Photo CD) for just $139 from JEM (phone 
617-254-5500).  Say "Summer Sizzler" when ordering.  Finally, MPS Multimedia 
(phone 800-533-4677, 415-731-4075, or FAX 415-731-1217) sells the CDR-55 
(300K/second, 340 ms, Photo CD) for $299 (internal) or $379 (external).  

o Toshiba CD-ROM Drive.  The latest, super fast (200 ms average access time; 
300K+/second sustained data transfer rate) Toshiba CD-ROM drive, Model 
XM-3401, is available from many dealers for about $500 (internal model; 
external model is priced higher).  The Toshiba is the best choice when 
performance is critical.  

o SCSI Adapters Two good values are the Adaptec 1522 (available for $79 from 
Smart Computer Systems, tel.  510-656-6794 or FAX 510-656-6685) and the 
Future Domain 1680 (only $129 from Computability, phone 800-554-9948 or FAX 
414-357-7814).  Both are 16-bit AT bus SCSI-2 adapters with on board 
diskette controllers (which can be disabled if necessary), and both are 
supported by drivers that ship with OS/2 2.1.  Neither use DMA [see (2.6) 
More Than 16 MB RAM].  Other possibilities include the bus mastering, AT 
bus, Adaptec 1540B ($100 from Discount Electronics Trading Int'l, tel.  
619-341-1107 or FAX 619-341-2217) and the Microchannel Adaptec 1640 ($139 
from Discount Electronics Trading Int'l).  These, too, are supported by 
drivers included with OS/2 2.1 itself.  For EISA and LocalBus systems, 
consider BusLogic SCSI adapters (which come with OS/2 2.1 drivers and 
complete instructions).  

o Wangtek Tape Drives.  Super Technologies (phone 909-393-4648) offers a

(2.6) More Than 16 MB RAM

Can I use more than 16 MB of RAM?  

OS/2 2.1 will address all the RAM in your system.  If the BIOS recognizes 
the memory, OS/2 will find it and use it.  

However, on certain systems the RAM beyond the 16 MB boundary may be used as 
a fast swap area.  OS/2 relies on its swap file, SWAPPER.DAT, to hold code 
and data which cannot fit into real memory (i.e.  to provide virtual 
memory).  If the swap file (and applications) can only be accessed via a 
hard disk adapter which uses 24-bit DMA for disk access (e.g.  the Adaptec 
154x series), then the system must move code and data below the 16 MB 
boundary before it can write it to disk.  This "double move" is costly (in 
terms of performance), and often OS/2 will merely use all the RAM above the 
16 MB boundary as a fast swap area (before writing to disk) to avoid the 
problem.  It is up to the hard disk adapter driver, however, to decide how 
to handle this situation.  

Only AT bus adapters are limited to 24-bit DMA.  Microchannel, EISA, VESA 
LocalBus, and other 32-bit adapters are not so limited.  Moreover, only a 
select few AT bus hard disk adapters utilize DMA.  Nearly all MFM, RLL, and 
IDE adapters, and many SCSI adapters, do not use DMA for disk access.  

Suffice it to say that, regardless of your present hardware, OS/2 will take 
advantage of it as best it can.  However, if you are planning new hardware 
purchases, you may wish to take this particular hardware design limitation 
into account.  Specifically, if you plan to install more than 16 MB of RAM 
in your system, either choose a 32-bit hard disk adapter (Microchannel or 
EISA, for example) or choose an AT bus adapter which does not utilize DMA 
for disk access (a standard IDE adapter, an Adaptec 152x series SCSI 
adapter, or a Future Domain SCSI adapter, for example).  The performance 
trade-off is highly system dependent, however.  You may find that even DMA 
adapters such as the Adaptec 154x series outperform the alternatives in 
certain cases.

I would like to set up an OS/2 BBS.  What is available?  

OS/2 is an excellent environment for BBS operation (even using DOS/Windows 
software), including large multiline facilities.  Related software will 
enable FidoNet capabilities, gateways to Usenet/UUCP, nodelist processing, 
additional file transfer protocols, and more.  

Five popular OS/2-specific BBSes are Maximus and Simplex [available from 
(3.2) Shareware and Freeware Sources), Omega Point/2 (BBS 404-564-1961), 
Magnum (phone 818-706-9800, BBS 818-706-9805), and Multi-Net (phone 
503-883-8099, BBS 503-883-8197).

(3.6) Multimedia (MMPM/2)

What do I need for OS/2 multimedia applications?  

OS/2 2.1 includes both the Win-OS/2 multimedia extensions and MMPM/2, the 
OS/2 multimedia extensions, at no extra charge.  OS/2 2.1's MMPM/2 includes 
software motion video support for both IBM Ultimotion and Intel Indeo files.  
Software motion video provides playback of video clips in a window under 
OS/2.  (Video for Windows will operate correctly under Win-OS/2, but 
Ultimotion is far more capable than Video for Windows.  Ultimotion supports 
higher frame rates, larger image sizes, better synchronization of video and 
audio, and, often, simultaneous playback of two or more video clips, even 
with background tasks running.)  An accelerated display adapter and a fast 
processor can help improve the quality of software motion video.  

Drivers for the Creative Labs SoundBlaster series, MediaVision ProAudio 
series, and IBM M-Audio Capture and Playback Adapter are provided with 
MMPM/2.  Other drivers should be available from (3.2) Shareware and Freeware 
Sources, or contact your adapter vendor for information on OS/2 driver 
support.  (The original SoundBlaster and certain ATI SoundBlaster clones may 
require a low cost upgrade from the manufacturer to work with MMPM/2.)  A 
driver for the PC speaker has been released by IBM, but this driver demands 
a huge amount of processor attention and does not provide the fidelity that 
audio adapters do.  

Note that the MediaVision ProAudio Spectrum Plus operates correctly when 
using the built-in MMPM/2 ProAudio Spectrum 16 driver.  However, to obtain 
full functionality you must change the PARAMSTRING line in the 
[ibmwavepas1601] section of the file \MMOS2\MMPM2.INI after installation of 
MMPM/2.  Using a text editor (like the OS/2 System Editor), change the line 
so that BPS=8 instead of BPS=16.  This change causes MMPM/2 to default to 
8-bit audio (since the ProAudio Spectrum Plus does not support 16-bit 
audio).  

The MMPM/2 driver for the original SoundBlaster supplied with OS/2 2.1 
contains a special check which may render it inoperable with SoundBlaster 
clones (like the MediaVision Thunderboard).  Advanced users may patch the 
driver using the following commands:  
 
 CD \MMOS2
 COPY SBD2.SYS SBD2.OLD
 DEBUG SBD2.SYS
 -e 3fd8 00 
 -w
 -q
 
MMPM/2 drivers should also be available for Digitan and Omni sound adapters, 
directly from their manufacturers.  VideoLogic's (phone 617-494-0530) 
DVA-4000 supports video capture and video display in OS/2 windows as does 
New Media Graphics's (phone 508-663-0666) Super VideoWindows.  Tecmar (phone 
800-624-8560 or 216-349-1009, or FAX 216-349-0851) offers various OS/2 
multimedia products, including the ProSound audio adapter.  

REXX programs [see (5.11) REXX] can be used to play, record, and manipulate 
MMPM/2 audio and video files.  For more information on REXX and MMPM/2, 
consult the online Multimedia with REXX document (located in the Multimedia 
folder).  

More information on IBM's OS/2 multimedia extensions (MMPM/2) and tools, 
Ultimotion, multimedia hardware, and IBM multimedia titles (e.g.  
Illuminated Manuscript) is available through IBM's Multimedia Office (phone 
800-426-9402 ext.  150).  

To install a Windows sound driver under Win-OS/2, make sure that the line 
drivers=mmsystem.dll appears in the file \OS2\MDOS\WINOS2\SYSTEM.INI under 
the [boot] section.  In some cases an installation bug prevents this line 
from being set up properly.

(3.7) Viruses

Should I worry about viruses when running OS/2 2.1?  

At present there are no OS/2-specific viruses.  However, DOS/Windows viruses 
can conceivably infect an OS/2 2.1 system.  DOS/Windows antivirus tools are 
just as useful in preventing such infection.  Also, IBM has an antivirus 
package (AntiVirus/2) which runs under OS/2 directly (without DOS/Windows 
emulation).  To order AntiVirus/2, call 800-551-3579 (800-465-7999 in 
Canada).  McAfee's OS/2 SCAN and CLEAN have been released, as has Dr.  
Solomon's Antivirus Toolkit for OS/2 from Ontrack Systems.  Others (Dr.  
Cohen, for example) are in development.  

But OS/2 2.1 is likely to be much more resistant to viruses because of its 
design.  Viruses running in one virtual DOS/Windows session are likely to be 
confined to that session.  Low level disk access is curtailed under OS/2 
2.1, thus preventing most virus infection at that level.  And when a 
DOS/Windows virus does trigger, it is far less likely to disrupt the entire 
system.  In fact, OS/2 is most vulnerable when it isn't in charge (i.e.  
when native DOS is being used).  A DOS virus then has free reign to write to 
the hard disk and possibly disable OS/2.  The greater risk comes from 
leaving OS/2.  

OS/2 2.1 is by no means virus proof -- no system is.  But it should prove 
more resistant to virus infection.

(3.8) Networking

What networking products are available for OS/2 2.1?  

In addition to DOS/Windows products, OS/2-specific TCP/IP support is 
available from IBM (phone 800-IBM-CALL), Essex Systems (phone 508-750-6200 
or FAX 508-750-4699), FTP Software (send mail to info@ftp.com), Wollongong 
(phone 415-962-7100 or FAX 415-969-5547), {{ Novell, Ipswitch Inc.  (phone 
617-942-0621 or mail support@ipswitch.com), }} and others.  (A freeware SLIP 
implementation, PMNOS, is available; see (3.2) Shareware and Freeware 
Sources.)  {{ Optional add-ons to IBM's TCP/IP package provide X-Window 
System server and/or client support.  Hummingbird Communications offers the 
eXceed X-Window System server for OS/2.  }} 

The NetWare Workstation Kit 2.01 for OS/2 is available from Novell (phone 
800-873-2831) and IBM for a small charge; it is also available free of 
charge from (3.2) Shareware and Freeware Sources.  Note that NetWare {{ 4.01 
}} Server (including all the NLMs) can run alongside OS/2 2.1 at the same 
time, making OS/2 2.1 the only operating system providing nondedicated 
NetWare {{ 4.01 }} server and client capability (a boon for administration 
and dual LAN Server/NetWare servers, for example).  The package to enable 
NetWare {{ 4.01 }} Server to run alongside OS/2 2.1 is available from IBM 
Direct (800-IBM-2-YOU), Part No.  53G5730.  IBM also offers both NetWare and 
LAN Server 3.0 (Basic and Advanced) with LAN requesters.  Microsoft sells 
LAN Manager (which comes bundled with OS/2 1.3).  An OS/2 2.1 LAN Manager 
Requester, part no.  96F8359, is available from IBM; Microsoft offers a 
similar requester with LAN Manager 2.1a (or later).  DEC sells Pathworks 
(Version 2.0b or later) for OS/2.  Banyan Vines 5.5 (or later) includes an 
OS/2 2.x requester.  

OS/2 NDIS MAC drivers for most network adapters are available from (3.2) 
Shareware and Freeware Sources, as well as vax.ftp.com via Internet 
anonymous ftp.  Drivers for 3Com adapters are available via anonymous ftp 
from ftp.3com.com, from the 3Com Support BBS, or from CompuServe (GO 
THREECOM).  Drivers for Cabletron adapters are available via anonymous ftp 
from ftp.ctron.com.  

Peer-to-peer networking under OS/2 2.1 is best accomplished (at the moment) 
with either a TCP/IP or APPN product, like IBM's TCP/IP or Communications 
Manager/2, respectively.  TCP/IP (with NFS) is available for nearly all 
platforms, so it is a particularly good choice in a mixed environment.  
Artisoft is reportedly working on an OS/2 version of LANtastic; contact the 
company for details.  Note that LANtastic 5.0 can run in an OS/2 2.1 DOS 
session, providing either client or server capability (including access to 
HPFS long filenames for DOS clients).  IBM may have its own offering in the 
near future (a repackaging and upgrade of the peer-to-peer support already 
provided in LAN Server 3.0).  This support can already interoperate with 
Microsoft Windows for Workgroups.  

Infoworld recently called OS/2 the best PC operating system for networking 
in a mixed environment (i.e.  with multiple network protocols and/or 
platforms).  With IBM's Network Transport Services/2 at the base (i.e.  by 
working through a single NDIS interface, using ODI "shims" if necessary), 
multiple network protocols can share the same network adapter under OS/2, 
avoiding contention.  OS/2 is equally adept as network client, server, 
and/or peer.  It is flexible enough to meet the needs of almost any network 
user.

(3.9) Extended Services

What is Extended Services?  

Prior to Version 2.0, IBM offered two separate packages with each release of 
OS/2:  Standard Edition and Extended Edition.  Extended Edition included 
extra, bundled software products:  the Communications Manager (for 
communication with IBM mainframes, minicomputers, and other hosts), Database 
Manager (a full, network aware, relational database), and LAN Requester.  

IBM has now unbundled the Extended Edition features, dropped LAN Requester 
from the package (now available separately, with IBM's LAN Server), updated 
it for OS/2 2.x, and renamed it Extended Services 1.0.  ES, by itself, no 
longer includes the base operating system as Extended Edition once did.  

This new arrangement makes it easier to update the base operating system 
with CSDs [See (4.6) Corrective Service Diskettes].  And now ES 1.0 will run 
under OS/2 1.3 Standard Edition as well as OS/2 2.x.  Also, ES 1.0, like 
OS/2 2.x itself, is designed to operate on both IBM and non-IBM systems [See 
(2.1) Hardware Requirements].  

While Extended Services will remain available, IBM has decided to further 
separate the ES components.  DB2/2, a full 32-bit relational database, is 
available separately as a replacement for ES's Database Manager.  
Communications Manager/2 is now also available by itself.  With each 
component available "a la carte," you can configure your OS/2 system to your 
exact specifications (almost always at a lower cost), and you are free to 
substitute similar products from other vendors (so you aren't locked into 
IBM's offerings).  

To install Extended Services 1.0 under OS/2 2.1, you must replace the 
ESSTART.CMD file on ES Diskette 1 with the ESSTART.BAK file found in the 
\OS2\INSTALL directory Keep a backup of the old file.

(4.1) Installation

I am having trouble installing OS/2 2.1.  What should I do?  

First consult the Installation Guide and other materials accompanying OS/2 
2.1.  Make sure your PC meets the system requirements in (2.1) Hardware 
Requirements.  

And if the following instructions do not help, fall back on IBM's toll free 
technical support (phone 800-992-4777 in the United States) and/or consult 
IBM's Tips and Techniques file [See (3.2) Shareware and Freeware Sources].  

o Midway through installation of OS/2 2.1 from CD-ROM, do not place a check 
mark in the box next to the CD-ROM Device Support option on the System 
Configuration screen.  Do not attempt to view or change this CD-ROM drive 
selection.  

o When installing OS/2 2.1 from a CD-ROM drive that requires a driver not 
supplied by IBM, copy the OS/2 .ADD driver file to a copy of Diskette 1 and 
add the line:  

    BASEDEV=xxxxxxxx.ADD 

to the end of the diskette's CONFIG.SYS file.  After installation, if your 
CD-ROM drive is not functioning correctly, follow these steps (changing "C:"  
if necessary):  

1. Copy the files OS2CDROM.DMD and CDFS.IFS from Diskette 1 to directory 
C:\OS2.  

2. Edit CONFIG.SYS and add the following lines to the end of the file:  
         
         BASEDEV=OS2CDROM.DMD /Q
         IFS=CDFS.IFS /Q
         
3. Reboot.  

4. Start Selective Install from the System Setup folder.  Check the CD-ROM 
Device Support checkbox on the System Configuration screen.  Click OK to 
display the list of CD-ROM drives.  Select the appropriate choice (usually 
OTHER) and click OK.  

5. Continue the Selective Install procedure until complete, then reboot.  

o If you have formatted any of your hard drives with HPFS under OS/2 2.0, 
and you have upgraded to OS/2 2.1, go to an OS/2 command line (window or 
full screen) and type:  

    CHKDSK x: 

where x is the drive letter.  Repeat for all HPFS drives on your system.  If 
you see the error SYS0551 you should immediately contact IBM for the 
"OS2DASD Fix," {{ usually filename 21DISK.ZIP }} (or download it from (3.2) 
Shareware and Freeware Sources).  

o Some PCs have trouble printing under OS/2 2.1.  This problem can often be 
traced to an interrupt conflict, a substandard cable, an interfering 
software security "dongle," or a faulty printer adapter.  LPT1 uses IRQ 7, 
and LPT2, if installed, uses IRQ 5. Interrupts should not be shared on AT 
bus machines.  The SoundBlaster, for example, comes set to IRQ 7. Reset it 
to an unused interrupt.  

o Make sure adapters with onboard ROMs are not conflicting with other 
adapters.  For example, many SuperVGA adapters use large segments of upper 
memory, and many hard disk adapters have onboard ROMs which can be mapped 
into the same areas.  Adapters must not share address space or interrupts.  
Check your product manuals for more help.  {{ To resolve conflicts, try 
writing down the DMA channel(s), interrupt (IRQ) level(s), I/O or port 
addresses, and ROM or upper memory addresses used by every device in your 
system.  Conflicts should then be readily apparent.  }} 

o Be sure adequate free disk space is available before installing, including 
space for a swap file.  Drives compressed using Stacker, DoubleSpace, or 
similar utilities should be uncompressed before installing (unless access to 
these drives from OS/2 is not needed).  [A DoubleSpace {{ converting, }} 
OS/2 version of Stacker is available, as is Proportional Software's (phone 
303-484-2665) DCF/2 on-the-fly disk compression package.] 

o Do not select HPFS when installing if your machine has 6 MB of RAM or 
less, or diminished performance will likely result.  Change the IFS=...HPFS 
line in your CONFIG.SYS to REM IFS=...  if necessary.  

o Be sure your CMOS setup parameters are set correctly, especially those 
relating to floppy drives.  RAM should be given sufficient wait states and 
precharge cycles.  Test with cache memory and/or shadow RAM disabled if 
necessary.  The AT bus should run at 8 MHz.  For best performance, make sure 
all your RAM is set to be cacheable.  

o If you are using the IBMINT13.I13 driver to access an MFM, RLL, or ESDI 
hard drive, and the hard drive has more than 1024 cylinders, be certain your 
hard disk adapter's sector translation mode is enabled.  Regardless of the 
driver you use, make sure your boot partition is completely inside the first 
1024 cylinders.  

o Older Adaptec SCSI adapters may require a free BIOS upgrade to recognize 
hard disks larger than 1 GB.  Adaptec can be reached at 800-442-7274 or 
408-945-8600.  Some Quantum LPS105AT IDE hard disks require a free ROM 
update (to Version 2.6) from the manufacturer to work with OS/2.  

o If your AMI keyboard BIOS is below Revision F you may need an update.  
Contact Washburn & Assoc.  (phone 716-248-3627) for an inexpensive 
replacement.  

o Check to make sure keyboard DIP switches are set correctly.  For example, 
if the keyboard is attached to a system with an AT bus it should typically 
be switched to "AT" mode.  

o "Autoswitching" on non-IBM EGA adapters should be disabled (usually with a 
DIP switch or jumper setting).  In rare cases it may be necessary to switch 
third party VGA/SuperVGA adapters into 8-bit mode and/or disable 
"autosense."  See (2.2) SuperVGA Support.  

o OS/2 is particularly sensitive to bad RAM or cache memory (often reflected 
in TRAP 0002 error messages).  Use a thorough RAM testing utility, and try 
not to mix 9-chip and 3-chip SIMM/SIPP memory modules.  When upgrading, 
avoid adding RAM which is not rated (in nanoseconds) at least as fast (i.e.  
with an equal or lower number) as the RAM already in the system.  

o Allow several minutes for OS/2 2.1 to build your desktop (and display 
icons) at the end of installation -- take the Tutorial offered to you in the 
meantime.  Avail yourself of the "Start Here" icon, the other online help, 
and the README file located in the root directory.  They will help in 
getting started with the Workplace Shell and in properly configuring your 
system.  

o When installing over a beta version of OS/2 be sure to reformat.  

o To install the Upgrade Edition of OS/2 2.1, DOS or OS/2 must already 
reside on the hard disk.  If Diskette 1 is not write protected then the 
installation program will record a file indicating that upgrade terms have 
been satisfied and, in the future, will not require DOS or OS/2 on the hard 
disk to install.  

o OS/2 uses the same diskette format as DOS, so use DISKCOPY to backup the 
installation diskettes and verify that none have been corrupted.  

o Owners of IBM PS/2s should make sure that any applicable ECAs (engineering 
changes) have been performed and that the most recent Reference Diskette is 
in use.  Reference Diskettes are available from the IBM PC Co.  BBS (modem 
919-517-0001).  

o Try disconnecting any tape backup device if "Cannot find COUNTRY.SYS" 
messages are encountered when booting OS/2.  {{ This error message may also 
indicate that OS/2 cannot find its boot drive, usually because of an 
improperly loaded or omitted hard disk .ADD device driver.  }} 

o An Always IN-2000 SCSI adapter with BIOS 3.06A or 3.20 requires an updated 
version from the manufacturer.  A companion 8-pin serial PROM chip may also 
need to be updated.  Contact Always at 818-597-9595.  Also ask about 
non-IBMINT13.I13 driver support.  

o The TI TM4000 notebook may require a BIOS update to run OS/2 2.1; phone 
817-771-5856 for help.  Also ask about an OS/2 driver for the QuickPort 
trackball.  Before installing OS/2 on this machine, be sure to set Advanced 
OS Power off and HDD Motor Timeout Always On in the second page of the 
machine's setup screen.  

o For the technically advanced user, the following list of TRAP error codes 
may help you in addressing OS/2 problems.  Report any such TRAPs to IBM 
using the (4.10) Problem Report Form.

(4.2) Installing from Drive B

I can't install OS/2 2.1 from Drive B. What's wrong?  

IBM OS/2 2.1 can only be installed starting from Drive A, like DOS (unless 
your BIOS supports booting from Drive B).  After booting from Drive A, OS/2 
can then be copied from CD-ROM or across a network.  (For more information 
on installation across a network, see Remote Installation and Maintenance, 
IBM Publication No.  GG24-3780.  Related publications include Automated 
Installation for CID Enabled OS/2 2.0, IBM Pub.  No.  GG24-3783, and 
Automated Installation for CID Enabled Extended Services, LAN Server 3.0 and 
Network Transport Services/2, IBM Pub.  No.  GG24-3781.)  If you have the 
wrong disk size go back to your dealer and obtain the correct media.  
Otherwise you could open your machine and swap floppy drive cable 
connectors, use your system's setup utility to set the new CMOS parameters, 
and then install OS/2 from the "new" Drive A. Sometimes the floppy drive 
cable connectors will not be the same.  If so you can obtain an adapter 
plug.  

You may also use IBM's twin "bootstrap" diskette images [See (3.2) Shareware 
and Freeware Sources and download INS21L.ZIP if your diskette labels are 
blue or INS21M.ZIP if your diskette labels are salmon] to boot from a 5.25 
inch Drive A and install using 3.5 inch OS/2 diskettes inserted into Drive 
B. This procedure should only be used if absolutely necessary.

(4.3) Hard Disk Partitioning

What is the best way to partition my hard disk for OS/2?  

There is no single best way to partition your hard disk for OS/2.  For some 
advice on the subject you should consult the IBM OS/2 Installation and 
Planning Guide, available for download from (3.2) Shareware and Freeware 
Sources, and the OS/2 Installation Guide in the OS/2 package.  

It can be useful to place OS/2 by itself in a separate partition of about 40 
or 50 MB.  If you then elect to experiment with beta releases of OS/2, you 
can reformat that particular partition quite easily to erase all old code.  
The swap file can be placed on another partition; its location is determined 
by the SWAPPATH line in CONFIG.SYS.  

Partitioning should be performed by booting the OS/2 Installation Disk.  
Executing FDISK from the command line will not allow certain functions to be 
performed.

(4.4) Starting OS/2 from Diskette (and CHKDSK)

How do I access HPFS partitions on my hard drive without booting from the 
hard drive?  I'm getting error messages now -- how do I "repair" my hard 
disk?  

With IBM OS/2 2.1, insert the Installation Diskette, Shutdown (if 
necessary), and reboot.  When prompted insert Diskette 1 and press ENTER.  
When prompted, press ESC.  You will be given an OS/2 command line prompt.  
From there you can make necessary changes to your hard disk -- an OS/2 
character mode text editor on diskette is handy for such changes.  (Make 
sure you backup CONFIG.SYS before making any changes so that you can easily 
revert to the old version should things go wrong.)  

You may use this diskette boot method to run CHKDSK on your FAT or HPFS 
volumes.  After you reach the command line, insert Diskette 2. Do not log to 
another drive.  Type CHKDSK X:  /F to repair most kinds of damage to your 
hard disk, replacing X with the appropriate drive letter.  OS/2 CHKDSK will 
also mark your hard disk as accessible, if possible, should OS/2 "lock it 
out" for some reason.  It will also allow Workplace Shell drive objects to 
open properly if they are not functioning correctly.  Repeat twice for each 
drive letter you wish to check and/or repair.  

"Errors" may be reported by CHKDSK if OS/2 was booted from the hard disk.  
These "errors" are normal.  Since the hard drive is in use by OS/2 itself 
(and files are open) CHKDSK is unable to accurately report errors.  

The best way to avoid the need to perform CHKDSK is to always select Refresh 
then Shutdown.  Click on the Workplace Shell desktop background using mouse 
button two to bring up the appropriate menu.  Also, avoid manipulating 
OS/2-related files when using native DOS.  Finally, enable autochecking for 
all your hard disk volumes.  For HPFS volumes use the /AUTOCHECK parameter 
in the IFS=...HPFS line in your CONFIG.SYS.  For FAT volumes use the AC 
parameter in the DISKCACHE line of your CONFIG.SYS.  See the online Command 
Reference for details.  

Several utilities [including BOOTOS2; See (3.2) Shareware and Freeware 
Sources] can create a single, bootable OS/2 diskette (as a convenience).  
Preloaded versions of OS/2 2.0 can create a bootable diskette pair from the 
Welcome folder.  (This step, along with a full BACKUP after a diskette boot, 
should be performed immediately upon receipt of any IBM preloaded OS/2 2.0 
system.)

How can I get answers to my OS/2 questions?  

If your question is not answered in this List, post a note to the 
appropriate Usenet conference:  comp.os.os2.apps carries discussions related 
to finding or using any application running under OS/2, 
comp.os.os2.networking looks at networking issues, comp.os.os2.advocacy 
deals with opinions and speculation, comp.os.os2.programmer.porting helps 
programmers move applications over to OS/2 from other operating systems and 
environments, comp.os.os2.programmer.misc addresses anything else related to 
OS/2 programming, comp.os.os2.beta explores beta releases of OS/2, 
comp.os.os2.ver1x supports all releases of OS/2 prior to Version 2.0, 
comp.os.os2.announce carries important OS/2 announcements, comp.os.os2.bugs 
discusses possible bugs found in released versions of the operating system,

CSDs are Corrective Service Diskettes, or bug fixes (Service Paks), 
periodically issued by IBM.  The OS/2 CSD level number may be obtained using 
the command SYSLEVEL from an OS/2 command line prompt.  CSDs are cumulative, 
i.e.  only the most recent CSD is required to bring a system up from any 
previous CSD level.  However, CSDs only apply within a major version number.  
For example, an upgrade, not a CSD, would bring OS/2 Version 2.0 up to 
Version 2.1.  Note also that each national language (e.g.  French, U.K.  
English) uses a distinct CSD.  

{{ CSDs may be ordered by phoning 800-494-3044.  Customers with IBM customer 
numbers (usually large sites) should order through IBMLink.  }} Outside the 
United States, ask an authorized IBM dealer or representative for the CSD.  
CSDs may also be downloaded from the IBM PC Co.  BBS (modem 919-517-0001), 
CompuServe (FIND OS/2), or from (3.2) Shareware and Freeware Sources.  And 
CSDs may be ordered through IBM's OS/2 BBS.  

The latest, current OS/2 2.1 CSD level will be listed in this List and in 
the PS/2 Assistant files.  At present there is no Service Pak for OS/2 2.1.  
{{ A second Service Pak, Level XR06100, has been released for OS/2 2.0.  }}

(4.7) Online Services

Which online services support OS/2, and how do I join?  

IBM's official non-IBM online service for OS/2 user and developer support is 
CompuServe (FIND OS/2).  In the United States you can obtain a free 
introductory CompuServe membership by calling 800-524-3388 and asking for 
Representative 239.  

IBM maintains an unofficial presence on many other networks.  For 
information on the Internet consult one of the many books describing the 
network.  One example:  The Whole Internet by Ed Krol, O'Reilly & Associates 
(phone 707-829-0515), ISBN 1-56592-025-2.  Once you start using the Internet 
you should peruse the information files posted to the news.answers newsgroup 
to familiarize yourself with Internet resources.  

The OS/2 Roundtable (Page 1400, Keyword OS2) has opened on GEnie.  To 
subscribe to GEnie, set your communications software to half duplex and 
either 1200 or 2400 bps then have your modem dial 800-638-8369 (800-387-8330 
in Canada).  Upon connection, type HHH and press RETURN.  At the U#= prompt 
type SIGNUP and press RETURN, then follow the directions given.  

{{ Delphi not only provides full access to the Internet (GO INT), but there 
is also a dedicated OS/2 forum (GO CUS 41) available on the service.  The 
base rate is only $20 for 20 hours of access per month.  To sign up for 
Delphi's five hour free trial and save the $19 signup fee (if you end up 
joining permanently), (1) call 800-695-4002 with your modem; (2) at the 
CONNECT message press ENTER a couple times; (3) at the USERNAME prompt type 
JOINDELPHI and press ENTER; (4) at the PASSWORD prompt type CUSTOM41 and 
press ENTER; (5) follow the instructions to sign up for the service.  (Your 
five free hours expire at the end of the calendar month you sign up for 
Delphi, so you probably will not want to sign up at the end of the month 
unless you use the free time right away.)  }}

(4.10) Problem Report Form

How do I report an OS/2 problem to IBM?  

If you would like to send an OS/2 bug report to IBM, you may phone IBM at 
800-992-4777 (in the U.S.)  or you may fill in the OS/2 Problem Report Form 
and mail it to IBM via CompuServe or the Internet.  

The Problem Report Form helps IBM solve your problem more quickly, 
especially if you include all the relevant details.  IBM then has to ask 
fewer questions in order to determine the problem.  

To use the Problem Report Form, follow these steps:  

1. If you are reading the INF version of this List, press CTRL-F.  This 
panel will then be saved to a file named TEXT.TMP.  

2. Using a text editor (like the OS/2 System Editor), open either TEXT.TMP 
or the plain text version of this List.  

3. Delete all the extra lines in the file so that only the OS/2 Problem 
Report Form remains.  

4. Fill in all the requested information using your text editor.  

5. Save the Form to disk (as file name OS2PROB.TXT for example).  

6. Upload the file to CompuServe Mail or the Internet, and send the Form to 
IBM.  (The exact procedure will depend on the service and the software you 
use.)  
  
You may use the Problem Report Form as many times as you need to, but please 
include only one problem per copy.  If you wish, you can use the Defect 
Report Form found on Page 493 of the OS/2 2.1 Using the Operating System 
manual instead of this form.  
  
------  Submit an OS/2 Problem Report  ------
  
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
<< THIS SUPPORT IS ELIGIBLE FOR U.S. CUSTOMERS ONLY >>
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
  
Customers should use this form to report a suspected OS/2 DEFECT to 
IBM support.
  
IBM employees should refer to the OS2DFECT FORUM in IBMPC for instructions on 
how to report an OS/2 defect.
  
If you have How-to or other questions about OS/2, please refer to these 
sources:
  
- The OS/2 on-line help and README.
- If you have a CompuServe ID, you may submit an item to the 
  appropriate section within the forums under IBMOS2 (GO IBMOS2).
- Many bulletin board systems contain user forums where OS/2 users 
  share information and ideas on OS/2.
  
Please provide as much information as possible on your problem.  Feel free to 
add additional space, or remove sections of the form that are not relevant to 
your problem.

 (5.2)  I prefer Windows.  How do I make OS/2 2.1 resemble Windows
        (or OS/2 1.3)?

 (5.3)  Sometimes OS/2 2.1 will freeze when I run an application.  What
        do I do?

 (5.9)  How do I boot a real version of DOS from within OS/2 2.1? 

 (5.10)  Are there any clever tricks that apply to OS/2 2.1? 

 (5.11)  How do I use REXX?  What does it do? 

 (5.12)  What ANSI escape sequences can be used? 


(5.1) Making OS/2 Resemble Unix

I'm a Unix wizard.  How do I make OS/2 resemble Unix?  

A great number of GNU and Unix utilities have been ported to OS/2 native 
mode and are available from (3.2) Shareware and Freeware Sources.  A uucp 
package, UUPC/Extended, is available via anonymous ftp from 
ftp.clarkson.edu, directory /pub/uupc; mail help@kew.com with questions.  

In addition, the Hamilton C Shell is available from Hamilton Labs (phone 
508-358-5715 or mail 3890321@mcimail.com).  The Thompson Toolkit, a 
Bourne-like shell, and awk are published by Thompson Automation (phone 
206-224-1639).  MKS (phone 519-884-2251 or mail pat@mks.com) publishes a 
number of standard Unix utilities for OS/2.  Hippix (Hippo Software, phone 
801-531-1004) provides a set of low cost Unix-like command utilities (such 
as grep, awk, sh, and vi) along with a POSIX programming library.  An OS/2 
version of lint is available from Gimpel Software (phone 215-584-4261).  For 
OS/2-specific X Windows server support, IBM provides an optional package 
available with its TCP/IP 2.0 for OS/2.  The TCP/IP 2.0 base package 
includes a multithreaded news reader as well.  

DOS and Windows based utilities and aids still work fine under OS/2 2.1.

(5.2) Making OS/2 Resemble Windows

I prefer Windows.  How do I make OS/2 2.1 resemble Windows (or OS/2 1.3)?  

Spend some time with the Workplace Shell first.  Browse the online Tutorial, 
Master Help Index, and Start Here facilties.  Consult the Unofficial Guide 
to the Workplace Shell, available from (3.2) Shareware and Freeware Sources.  

If you still prefer Windows-like behavior, follow the instructions beginning 
on Page 401 in the OS/2 2.1 Using the Operating System manual.  

Note that you can run the Win-OS/2 Program Manager "seamlessly" on your OS/2 
desktop, and you can use it to launch DOS, Windows, and OS/2 applications.  
Using the Program Manager in this way can make even hard core Windows users 
more comfortable.

(5.3) Recovering from Crashed Sessions

Sometimes OS/2 2.1 will freeze when I run an application.  What do I do?  

Before rebooting with CTRL-ALT-DEL, try CTRL-ESC.  Do not hit additional 
keys, do not move the mouse.  Wait up to a minute.  Either the Window List 
or an error message should pop up.  You may close the offending application 
at that point; allow some time for it to close.  (Try ALT-ESC if you have 
disabled CTRL-ESC in that application's DOS Settings.  If you do not get any 
response, press CTRL-ESC or ALT-ESC repeatedly until the dialog appears.)  
Note that the Workplace Shell can recycle, independent of running 
applications, if it crashes.  

If the system is badly disabled, sometimes pressing CTRL-ALT-NUMLOCK twice 
will result in a prompt to create a dump diskette.  You may do so (the 
online Command Reference describes dump diskettes), or at that point you may 
reboot with CTRL-ALT-DEL.  

To prevent applications from automatically restarting see (5.10) Clever 
Tricks.  To restore the desktop to "factory defaults," use ALT-F1 when OS/2 
2.1 starts.  See Appendix C of the OS/2 2.1 Using the Operating System 
manual for details.  Note that if you have installed an OS/2 Service Pak 
[See (4.6) Corrective Service Diskettes] the ALT-F1 sequence will restore 
your desktop to the state it was found in just before installation of the 
Service Pak.

(5.4) Starting Background Processes

How do I start a background process from the OS/2 command line?  

Look up the START and DETACH commands in the online Command Reference.  

If you wish to start a DOS session with nondefault settings, use a utility 
such as STARTD.  If you wish to start an OS/2 session from a DOS session, 
try OS2EXEC.  Both (and several others) are available from (3.2) Shareware 
and Freeware Sources.

(5.5) Adobe Type Manager

How do I add new Adobe Type Manager typefaces?  

OS/2 2.1 comes with built-in Adobe Type Manager (ATM) for OS/2 and Win-OS/2.  
A basic set of typefaces (Courier, Helvetica, and Times New Roman) comes 
with OS/2 2.1 and is installed (if selected) for use under both OS/2's and 
Win-OS/2's ATM.  

Each typeface you install under OS/2 and/or Win-OS/2 should come with at 
least two separate files with PFB and AFM extensions.  To install a typeface 
for use under Win-OS/2, use the ATM Control Panel.  The Win-OS/2 ATM Control 
Panel will then build a PFM file from the AFM file if a PFM file is not 
already included.  To install a typeface for use with OS/2-specific 
applications, select OS/2 System -> System Setup -> Font Palette -> Edit 
Font -> Add.  

PFM files may converted to AFM files using the PFM2AFM utility, available 
from (3.2) Shareware and Freeware Sources.  (However, these converted AFM 
files sometimes produce unusual results.)  AFM files for Adobe commercial 
typefaces are available via Internet anonymous ftp from ftp.mv.us.adobe.com; 
the PFB files are available for purchase from Adobe.  Many public domain 
typefaces for OS/2's ATM are available from (3.2) Shareware and Freeware 
Sources.  Atech Software's (phone 800-786-FONT) AllType and Ares Software's 
(phone 415-578-9090) FontMonger convert between TrueType and Adobe Type 1 
formats (as does the popular Fontographer utility).  

Typeface files may be shared by OS/2 ATM and Win-OS/2 ATM.  To do so, 
install the typefaces using both the Font Palette and Win-OS/2 ATM Control 
Panel, specifying the same target path each time (most conveniently 
\PSFONTS).  

Note that IOPL=YES should appear in CONFIG.SYS; the modules WPPWNDRV, 
BVHSVGA, and PMATM are marked as requiring I/O privilege.

(5.6) Performance Tuning

How do I tweak OS/2 2.1 for maximum performance?  

For OS/2 overall, the CONFIG.SYS parameters MAXWAIT, TIMESLICE, PRIORITY, 
PRIORITY_DISK_IO, PROTECTONLY, and cache settings (in the DISKCACHE line, 
for FAT; or IFS line, for HPFS) can be tweaked.  The swap file should be 
placed on the most used partition on the least used hard disk, and its 
location is controlled by the SWAPPATH line.  See the online Command 
Reference for details.  

FAT partitions should be periodically defragmented.  A shareware 
defragmenter for DOS called DOG (Disk OrGanizer) works well, as do many 
others.  (You can boot DOS from a floppy disk to run such a utility.)  

For the Workplace Shell, drag shadows of most often used items to the 
desktop or to folders closer to the "surface" -- opening folders takes time.  
Drag shadows of program objects you use often (e.g.  the Win-OS/2 full 
screen Program Manager) to the Startup folder.  Disable animation (go to 
OS/2 System -> System Setup -> System -> Window).  Use the faster Details 
View when opening drive and folder objects; to set Details View as the 
default, open the settings notebook for the object, select the Menu tab, 
click on ~Open, then the Settings button, then select the Default Action.  

Try reducing the number of on screen colors or dropping down in screen 
resolution to enhance speed.  Close (not just minimize; check the Window 
List) unnecessary objects and applications.  Use the Monochrome scheme from 
the Scheme Palette -- it provides marginally faster screen updates.  
Consider adding more RAM.  

For DOS programs, run full screen instead of windowed if speed is important.  
In DOS Settings for each application:  reduce conventional, XMS, DPMI, and 
EMS memory allocations to the bare minimums required for maximum 
performance; turn off VIDEO_RETRACE_EMULATION unless necessary; adjust 
IDLE_SENSITIVITY; turn off DOS_BACKGROUND_EXECUTION if not needed; change 
the HW_TIMER setting (particularly for games); enable VIDEO_FASTPASTE if 
possible; turn on HW_ROM_TO_RAM.  Communications programs should use 
hardware handshaking where possible (use OS/2's MODE COMx command if 
necessary), and a buffered UART can prove helpful.  (DOS programs running 
under OS/2 will not be aware of a buffered 16550AF UART.  OS/2 virtualizes 
the serial port and manages the buffer itself.)  For faster printing set the 
DOS program's output port to LPTx.OS2 (where x is the printer port number) 
-- use a "print to file" option if necessary.  Disable any DOS print 
spoolers; rely on OS/2's spooler instead.  Increase CONFIG.SYS's 
PRINTMONBUFSIZE values.  Other, standard steps to enhance DOS performance 
(e.g.  increasing BUFFERS in CONFIG.SYS) of course apply.  

For Windows programs, run using a full screen desktop if speed is vital.  
The Win-OS/2 Full Screen icon set up by the installation program has poor 
Settings.  For better performance perform some of the same steps outlined in 
the preceding paragraph, including VIDEO_RETRACE_EMULATION off.  The same 
printer output advice also applies.  Consider disabling the Public setting 
in the Clipboard.  If available, set VIDEO_8514A_XGA_IOTRAP to off.  If 
mouse control is lost when switching to/from the Win-OS/2 session, try 
setting VIDEO_SWITCH_NOTIFICATION off.

 (1.3) DOS and Windows Compatibility 
 (5.7) Measuring Performance and Memory Usage 
 

(5.7) Measuring Performance and Memory Usage

How do I measure OS/2 performance and memory usage?  

OS/2 does not treat system resources like DOS.  Memory is treated as a 
virtual resource, used intelligently.  For example, OS/2 will retain unused, 
"dormant" code in memory if that memory is not otherwise required, on the 
assumption that that code may be used again.  Also, all but a small portion 
of OS/2 (and most applications, no matter how many are running) may be paged 
to disk should a large amount of physical memory be required.  Utilities 
which display "free" memory, then, are only useful for rough, relative 
measurements.  (Such utilities also often fail for another reason:  many 
only report the largest contiguous block of free physical RAM.  And a few 
will never report more than 16 MB of RAM because they were designed for OS/2 
1.x.)  

Similarly, utilities which purport to measure system load (e.g.  Pulse) 
should not be relied upon for definitive performance measurement.  
Subjective assessments are often much more reliable.  Pulse (and similar 
utilities) rely on a measurement of processor time allocated to a thread 
running at OS/2's lowest priority.  This method is sometimes subject to 
erroneous results.  

That said, more rigorous system performance optimization and monitoring 
tools include System Performance Monitor/2 (IBM Program No.  5871-3415), 
BenchTech (Synetik, phone 303-241-1718), OR/SysMon (International OS/2 User 
Group, phone 44-285-641175 or FAX 44-285-640181), CPU Monitor (Bon Ami), and 
Performance 2.1 (Clear & Simple, phone 203-658-1204).  

Note that OS/2's swap file is designed to behave with hysteresis.  It will 
not shrink in size as easily as it grows, under the assumption that swap 
space needed once may be needed again.  It should shrink given enough time 
and continued, less intense system loads.

(5.8) Displaying Background Bitmaps

My background bitmap does not display correctly.  What's wrong?  

Color bitmap images used for the Workplace Shell screen or folder 
backgrounds may not display correctly (may have distorted or missing colors) 
due to incorrect matching with OS/2's default palette.  Unlike Windows, OS/2 
does not adjust the palette to accommodate background bitmaps (to keep the 
rest of the desktop from experiencing color distortions).  (Palette control 
is now available to applications running under the 32-bit graphics engine 
with an appropriate display driver, however.)  

To remedy the problem you may use the numerous background images which have 
been specifically prepared for the Workplace Shell [available from (3.2) 
Shareware and Freeware Sources] or you may use an image editing/conversion 
utility which can create a proper, system palette-matched bitmap file.  For 
example, JoeView [available from (3.2) Shareware and Freeware Sources] may 
be used to import noninterlaced GIF, Windows BMP, and PCX files and save 
them as palette-matched OS/2 BMP files.  

Note that background bitmap images impose some additional overhead, taking 
up RAM and disk resources.  You should probably use them sparingly.  Also, 
if you have set a Win-OS/2 background bitmap you may experience desktop 
color distortions when running Windows programs "seamlessly."  Disable the 
Win-OS/2 background bitmap to remedy the problem.

(5.9) Specific DOS Sessions

How do I boot a real version of DOS from within OS/2 2.1?  

Booting a real version of DOS under OS/2 provides certain features that the 
OS/2 emulated DOS sessions cannot.  For example, a specific DOS session can 
provide access to devices (like CD-ROM drives) and networks for which there 
are only DOS device drivers.  A specific DOS session can also help get DOS 
applications which generate spurious "divide by zero" errors running again.  

You will be able to run one such session per hardware device.  So, for 
example, if you have your DOS networking software loaded in one specific DOS 
session, you may not start another, similar session.  

Specific DOS sessions are discussed in the online Command Reference (under 
VMDISK), the Master Help Index, and the printed Installation Guide (Appendix 
E).  You should consult those resources first.  However, if you are still 
unsure how to configure your system to run specific DOS sessions, follow 
these steps:  

1. Create a bootable DOS diskette.  Insert your DOS system diskette into 
Drive A and reboot.  When you arrive at the "A>" prompt, type FORMAT A:  /S 
and press ENTER.  (Note that you may wish to format the diskette for the 
smallest capacity possible, to save hard disk space later on.  For example, 
a 5.25 inch double density -- not high density -- diskette may be formatted 
to just 160K by adding the /1 /N:8 parameters to the FORMAT command.)  When 
prompted, insert a blank diskette into Drive A and press ENTER.  When the 
FORMAT operation is complete, remove the diskette and restart OS/2.  

2. Copy FSFILTER.SYS to the diskette.  Double click on OS/2 System -> 
Command Prompts -> OS/2 Window.  Insert the diskette you just formatted into 
Drive A. Copy the following file to your startable diskette:  
\OS2\MDOS\FSFILTER.SYS.  

3. Set up CONFIG.SYS.  Using a text editor (like the OS/2 System Editor) 
create the file A:\CONFIG.SYS with the following lines at the top:  
      
      DEVICE=FSFILTER.SYS
      DEVICE=C:\OS2\MDOS\HIMEM.SYS
      DEVICE=C:\OS2\MDOS\EMM386.SYS
      DEVICE=C:\OS2\MDOS\ANSI.SYS
      
Change the "C:"  drive letter if OS/2 is installed on another drive.  Add 
any other lines as required for your application (like CD-ROM or 
networking), but do not include any XMS, EMS, mouse, or memory management 
device drivers.  Make sure that everything is referenced with a drive letter 
and path, as above.  

4. Set up AUTOEXEC.BAT.  Likewise, create a file named A:\AUTOEXEC.BAT and 
make sure that the first line reads:  
      
      C:\OS2\MDOS\MOUSE
      
changing "C:"  if necessary.  Add any additional lines (like PATH, SET 
PROMPT, and so on) as required by your application.  {{ Make sure that 
\OS2\MDOS is referenced in the PATH.  }} 

5. Test your DOS diskette.  Once you have configured the CONFIG.SYS and 
AUTOEXEC.BAT files as you wish, double click on OS/2 System -> Command 
Prompts -> DOS from Drive A:.  A DOS session should start.  Test for the 
functionality you need (like access to your CD-ROM reader or network).  If 
the session is not working properly, press CTRL-ESC and shut down the 
session, edit CONFIG.SYS and/or AUTOEXEC.BAT as required, and repeat the 
test.  

6. Create the diskette image.  When you are satisfied that your specific DOS 
session diskette functions properly, go back to the OS/2 Window and type 
VMDISK A:  C:\DOS.IMG to create a diskette image file.  (If you want the 
file to be located on another drive or in another directory, change "C:\" 
accordingly.)  

7. Create a program object for your specific DOS session.  Drag a program 
object from your Templates folder to any target folder.  When the notebook 
opens, enter a single asterisk (*) in the Program Name field, then click on 
the right arrow in the lower right.  Select either DOS Window or DOS Full 
Screen for the session type, as desired.  Click on the DOS Settings button, 
and scroll down until you find the DOS_STARTUP_DRIVE property.  Enter 
C:\DOS.IMG in the field at the upper right.  (If your image file is not 
located on Drive C in the root directory, make the necessary changes.)  
Change any other DOS Settings if necessary.  Click on the Save button, then 
click on the General tab.  Give your program object a name.  Then close up 
the notebook.  
  
You should now be able to double click on your new program object to start 
your specific DOS session.  If you require access to your diskette drive 
(Drive A), use the FSACCESS command.  See the online Command Reference for 
details.  

When formatting your bootable DOS diskette, you may wish to use additional 
command line parameters to create a diskette with a reduced capacity.  The 
"smaller" the diskette, the less room the diskette image file created by 
VMDISK will take on your hard disk.  See your DOS manual for details, or use 
the example given above.

(5.10) Clever Tricks

Are there any clever tricks that apply to OS/2 2.1?  

o To force DIR to display your directories in alphabetical order, with the 
subdirectories listed first, add the line 
    
    SET DIRCMD=/O:GN
    
to CONFIG.SYS; and, if you wish the same for your DOS command line sessions, 
add the same line to AUTOEXEC.BAT.  You may also wish to run DOSKEY to 
enable the command history feature.  (Shutdown and reboot for changes to 
CONFIG.SYS to take effect.)  

o Hold down SHIFT while resizing text windows to make size changes 
permanent.  

o If you want to configure your printer port(s) for shared access (so that 
DOS programs like LapLink, for example, can use them directly), go to your 
printer object, click on it with mouse button two, select Open -> Settings, 
select the Output tab, then double click on the port you wish to share.  
Check the appropriate box.  

o While running a DOS graphics program in a window, use the graphics cut and 
paste feature to clip a picture and paste it into the Icon Editor.  You can 
then quickly and easily create custom icons for your applications.  

o To disable the automatic application restart feature, create a STARTUP.CMD 
file in the root directory of your OS/2 boot drive with the following REXX 
script:  
    
    /*  */
    call RxFuncadd 'SysLoadFuncs', 'RexxUtil', 'SysLoadFuncs'
    call SysLoadFuncs 
    call SysIni 'USER', 'PM_WorkPlace:Restart', 'DELETE:'
    'exit'
    
or add the line 
    
    SET RESTARTOBJECTS=STARTUPFOLDERSONLY
    
to your CONFIG.SYS.  To manually disable automatic application restart when 
booting OS/2, hold down the left CTRL, left SHIFT, and F1 keys 
simultaneously from the time the mouse pointer appears until icons are 
displayed on the desktop.  

o Use the Alarms applet to automatically start programs at specified times.  

To start the Alarms applet minimized, put /I in the Optional Parameters 
section of its program object settings.  

o If you wish to dispense with the Workplace Shell (and its overhead), 
particularly on low memory systems, change the line SET RUNWORKPLACE...  in 
CONFIG.SYS to read SET RUNWORKPLACE=C:\OS2\CMD.EXE (replacing C, if 
necessary, with a different drive letter).  In fact any program with job 
control (e.g.  Enhanced Editor, HyperAccess/5) can be used as the shell.  [A 
character mode alternative to the Workplace Shell, MenuMaster, is now 
available from (3.2) Shareware and Freeware Sources.] 

o To implement a small scroll back buffer for your OS/2 command line 
windows, use the command MODE CO80,102.  This procedure may be automated by 
adding /K MODE CO80,102 in the Optional Parameters section of the OS/2 
Window program object settings.  

o If you do not want any command line parameters passed to a program object 
that you start (for example, if you customize the desktop menu so that it 
has an additional option which starts a command line prompt) place a lone % 
in the Optional Parameters section of the program object settings.  If you 
do wish to pass parameters, but you want the extraneous information that the 
Workplace Shell passes to the object to be ignored, try putting && REM % in 
the Optional Parameters section after the parameters you wish passed.  

o If you want to move an icon a small distance, "grab" it from the edge 
nearest the direction you want to move the icon.  

o A clever way to manipulate files that are locked when the Workplace Shell 
is running (e.g.  display drivers) is to add the line CALL=CMD.EXE at the 
end of CONFIG.SYS.  Then Shutdown and reboot.  The system will restart with 
an OS/2 command line prompt.  Type EXIT to proceed into the Workplace Shell.  
Using CALL is also a convenient way to configure OS/2's serial ports using 
the MODE command.  For example:  
    
    CALL=C:\OS2\MODE.COM COM2:38400,N,8,1,OCTS=OFF,RTS=ON,BUFFER=ON
    
configures COM2 for high speed RTS handshaking and buffered I/O.  [Moreover, 
the MODE command can be used to determine whether your system has a buffered 
UART (National Semiconductor 16550A or equivalent), nearly essential for 
high speed communications.  Use the command:  

    MODE COMx 

(where x is the communications port number) from an OS/2 command line.  If 
you see anything but "BUFFER = N/A" then you have a buffered UART for that 
port.] 

You can use either CDDBOC or SHIFTRUN instead of CALL; both utilities are 
available from (3.2) Shareware and Freeware Sources.  

Another way, which works well with display drivers, is to copy the new 
DLL(s) to its(their) own directory (say, C:\NEW), then place that directory 
name first in LIBPATH in CONFIG.SYS.  Shutdown and reboot.  OS/2 will use 
that(those) DLL(s) before it attempts to use the one(s) located in \OS2\DLL.  
[This method is required when using a 16-bit OS/2 2.0 display driver with 
OS/2 2.0 CSD Level 06055 or later.  See (4.6) Corrective Service Diskettes.] 
To switch back to the old driver, edit CONFIG.SYS and remove C:\NEW from 
LIBPATH, then Shutdown and reboot.  

o To shutdown without a mouse, press CTRL-ESC, select the Desktop, then 
press the spacebar (to deselect any icons, if necessary), SHIFT-F10, and 
select Shutdown.  

o If your video driver does not support "seamless" Windows, try running the 
Win-OS/2 Program Manager in a DOS window.  

o Selective Install should be used with caution when changing mouse or 
display drivers.  Verify that proper changes have been made to CONFIG.SYS.  

o If your settings notebooks (or PM Sticky Pads) do not display but are 
listed in the Window List, click on the name of the settings notebook in the 
Window List (brought up with CTRL-ESC) with mouse button two and select 
Cascade.  

o If your \OS2\*.INI files have grown large, use the CopyINI or WPSBackup 
utilities to shrink them.  Both are available from (3.2) Shareware and 
Freeware Sources.  

o To restart the Workplace Shell (without saving desktop settings, perhaps 
after an accidental Arrange), use a utility such as psPM [available from 
(3.2) Shareware and Freeware Sources] to terminate PMSHELL.  

o To get rid of a WPS object that cannot be deleted, try one of the 
following:  

- Insert a blank diskette in Drive A, click on the stubborn object with 
mouse button two, select Move, select the Path page, enter A:\, press ENTER, 
then format the diskette; 

- Use the WPSTools or Black Hole, available from (3.2) Shareware and 
Freeware Sources.  (The WPSTools can also recreate desktop objects that have 
been lost.)  

o To load a device driver into high memory in a particular DOS session 
change the DOS_DEVICE setting for the session and add SIZE=0 before the path 
and filename for the device driver.  For example, the following DOS_DEVICE 
entry:  

    SIZE=0 C:\OS2\MDOS\ANSI.SYS 

loads the ANSI.SYS device driver into high memory in that particular 
session.  

o If you wish to create diskettes from MAKEDSKF (.DSK) image files, such as 
those contained on the CD-ROM version of OS/2, and you do not wish to use 
the DOS and OS/2 utility LOADDSKF, you may use a workstation.  For example, 
on an IBM RS/6000 or Sun workstation you may use the command:  

    dd if=(input filename) of=/dev/rfd0 ibs=1b obs=60b conv=sync 

o To reboot the machine from the command line, use:  
    
    SETBOOT /IBD:C
    
Change the last letter (C) if you want to boot from another drive.  {{ Disk 
buffers will be flushed, but Workplace Shell settings will not be saved.  }} 

o The settings notebooks now support drag and drop operations for assigning 
icons and for changing menus.  

To change the icon for an object, first open the settings notebook (click on 
the object with the secondary mouse button, then select Open -> Settings).  
Click on the General tab.  Then drag any other object to the icon located on 
the General page of the settings notebook.  The object's icon will change to 
match.  If you want to restore it to its former state, click on the Undo 
button.  

To assign actions to menus, open the settings notebook, then click on the 
Menu tab.  Click on any of the items in the Available menus section (or 
Create another).  To add an Action, drag the desired program object to the 
Actions on menu section.  

o To quickly maximize a window, double click on its title bar.  To restore 
the window to its former size, double click on the title bar again.  

o Select the Flowed setting (on the View page of the settings notebook) for 
fastest display when opening folders.  

o If you have UNDELETE enabled, but you want to delete an occasional file 
without the overhead incurred by having UNDELETE capability, use the /F 
parameter with the DEL command.  Using this parameter (in either a DOS or 
OS/2 Window) will bypass the routine which moves the file(s) to the 
directory specified by the DELDIR environment variable.  The file(s) is(are) 
deleted faster, but you will not be able to undelete it(them).  The /N 
parameter will prevent prompting ("Are you sure?").  

o OS/2 2.1 now includes the ability to set a power on password.  However, if 
you have forgotten your password, and you cannot unlock your desktop when 
you turn your machine on, try the following.  Start OS/2 from a diskette 
boot [see (4.4) Starting OS/2 from Diskette] to get a command line prompt.  
At the prompt, enter the following commands:  
    
    C:
    
(assuming OS/2 is installed on Drive C; change if necessary) 
    
    MAKEINI OS2.INI LOCK.RC
    
o If you are using a 1024x768 display driver (such as 8514/A), but you do 
not want the icons scaled up in size from 32x32 to 40x40, patch the display 
driver file (e.g.  \OS2\DLL\8514_32.DLL) using DEBUG or a similar utility.  
Search for the hexadecimal byte sequence 28 00 28 00 20 00 20 00 and replace 
the two 28 values with 20.  Reboot for the change to take effect, and be 
sure to keep a backup copy of the original file.  

o To hide your entire desktop, single click on any icon on the desktop, 
press CTRL-ESC, then press CTRL-SHIFT-ESC.  To return the desktop to normal, 
press CTRL-ESC then double click on Desktop.  

o If you would like to have a Presentation Manager application start up 
minimized, first set up a program object for it by dragging a Program 
template from the Templates folder.  Then, on the first page of the 
notebook, enter the full path and filename of the PM program, but 
deliberately misspell it.  Click on the arrow in the lower right to turn the 
page, then check the Start minimized checkbox.  Click on the left arrow to 
turn the page back, then correct the misspelling.  Fill in any other 
information, as desired, then close up the notebook.  The program object is 
now ready to start your PM application minimized.  

o To get approximately 730K free in your DOS sessions, change 
VIDEO_MODE_RESTRICTION in the session's settings to CGA (unless your 
application requires more than CGA graphics capabilities).  Note that you 
may have to place the line:  

    DOS_RMSIZE=639 

in your CONFIG.SYS file to get this much free memory.  

o {{ In a full screen, character mode OS/2 session it is normally impossible 
to copy text from the screen to the Clipboard.  To get around the problem, 
try setting your printer object to hold all print jobs, press the 
PrintScreen key while the full screen OS/2 session is active, return to the 
printer object and double click on the print job icon for the PrintScreen, 
then cut and paste from the editor.  }}

(5.11) REXX

How do I use REXX?  What does it do?  

REXX is built into every copy of OS/2 (where it is also known as Procedures 
Language/2).  It is a general purpose, interpreted programming language 
which was first released on IBM mainframes over a decade ago.  REXX is 
extremely easy to learn and use.  It is particularly strong at string 
manipulation, and it has features which are difficult to implement in 
compiled languages (like the ability to read its own source code or execute 
a string as a command).  

OS/2 applications can use REXX as a common scripting language, which means 
that users need not learn separate macro or script languages for each 
application.  For example, the OS/2 versions of Lotus 1-2-3 and Borland 
ObjectVision will interface with REXX.  OS/2's multimedia extensions 
(MMPM/2) contain a REXX interface, so REXX programs can play, record, and 
manipulate sound and video files.  And REXX can be used to create complex 
batch files (with interactive prompting), since it is integrated so tightly 
into OS/2's command processor.  Moreover, A pair of REXX visual builders 
(programming tools which help create even complex REXX applications quickly 
and easily using simple, drag and drop manipulation of on screen objects), 
HockWare's VisPro/REXX and Watcom's VX REXX, are now available.  

For more information on OS/2's REXX interpreter, see the REXX Information 
online documentation located in the Information folder.  For more 
information on REXX generally, consult the REXX Frequently Asked Questions 
List [available from (3.2) Shareware and Freeware Sources].  

Here are some REXX hints and tips:  

o If you wish to place program output in the REXX queue (for processing by a 
REXX program), try 
    
    DIR *.TXT | RXQUEUE 
    
as an example.  (In other words, pipe the program output to RXQUEUE.)  To 
use this program output in your REXX program, try 
    
    /* Sample */
    WHILE QUEUED() > 0 
    PARSE PULL X 
    SAY X 
    END 

o To execute REXX commands interactively from the command line, use the 
REXXTRY command.  For example:  
    
    REXXTRY DO X=1 TO 10;SAY X;END

(5.12) ANSI Escape Sequences

What ANSI escape sequences can be used?  

ANSI escape sequences provide cursor and screen control in OS/2 character 
mode sessions.  By default ANSI support is turned ON (although it may be 
turned off with the command ANSI OFF).  ANSI support is also available in 
DOS sessions if the device driver ANSI.SYS is loaded.  See the online 
Command Reference for details.  

The following ANSI escape sequences are available:  

  Key       
  ESC       Refers to ASCII code 27 (i.e. the Escape key) 
  #         Replace with the appropriate number 
  ....      Replace with additional attributes, if desired 
  
  Escape Code Sequence          Function 
  Cursor Controls               
  ESC[#;#H or ESC[#;#f          Moves cursor to line #, column # 
  ESC[#A                        Moves cursor up # lines 
  ESC[#B                        Moves cursor down # lines 
  ESC[#C                        Moves cursor forward # spaces 
  ESC[#D                        Moves cursor back # spaces 
  ESC[#;#R                      Reports current cursor line and column 
  ESC[s                         Saves cursor position for recall later 
  ESC[u                         Return to saved cursor position

  Keyboard Reassignments        
  ESC[#;#;....#p                The first ASCII code defines what is
                                to be changed; the remaining codes define
                                what it is to be changed to; strings are
                                permitted. Examples:
                                ESC[65;81p - A becomes Q 
                                ESC[81;65p - Q becomes A 
                                ESC[0;68;"dir";13p - Assign the F10 key
                                    to a DIR command.
                                The 0;68 portion is the extended ASCII
                                code for the F10 key and 13 is the ASCII
                                code for a carriage return. 
                                Other function key codes: F1=59, F2=60,
                                    F3=61, ... F10=68.
  
You can use ANSI escape sequences in the PROMPT environment variable to 
create complex command line prompts.  See the online Command Reference 
(under PROMPT) for details.  

For example, if you have a color monitor, try editing your CONFIG.SYS file 
so that 
  
  SET PROMPT=$e[32;40m$e[1m[$P]$e[0m
  
to obtain a more colorful OS/2 command line prompt.  (Case is significant in 
the example given.)  You can do the same for your DOS sessions if you edit 
PROMPT in AUTOEXEC.BAT, assuming you have ANSI.SYS loaded.  Note that the $i 
portion of your PROMPT will enable the help line at the top of the window or 
screen.  It is not included in the example above.  

To change the background color of your OS/2 command line sessions, modify 
your CONFIG.SYS file so that this line is changed as shown:  
  
  SET OS2_SHELL=C:\OS2\CMD.EXE /K BLUESCR.CMD
  
changing the drive letter, if necessary.  Then create a file named 
BLUESCR.CMD which contains the following lines:  
  
  @ECHO OFF 
  PROMPT=$e[32;44;1m
  PROMPT $p$g
  CLS 
  
Save the file to a directory that is named in the SET PATH line of your 
CONFIG.SYS file.  Reboot.  Then, when you start an OS/2 command line, the 
background color will be different.  You can change the numbers in the first 
PROMPT line to obtain different colors.

(6.1) Promoting OS/2

What can I do to promote OS/2?  

OS/2 is selling well, but there are steps you can take to assure that 
hardware devices and software will be available for OS/2 in the future.  
Customer requests do matter.  

o Politely, firmly, and repeatedly request driver support from printer, 
video adapter, and other hardware manufacturers.  

o When you receive a mailing for DOS/Windows software with a postpaid 
envelope, return the order form marked "Please send information on your OS/2 
version."  

o Start a user group at your location.  Contact Gene Barlow (phone 
214-402-6456) {{ or Kathy Fanning }} at IBM or mail ibmpcug@vnet.ibm.com for 
assistance.  Think about how you can publicize your user group.  For 
instance, most local newspapers and television stations will print/broadcast 
meeting announcements for free.  Your local cable television company will be 
happy to broadcast a videotape of your meeting on the public access channel.  

o Correspond with members of the computer trade press.  Ask for reviews of 
OS/2 software, hardware compatibility testing with OS/2, OS/2 benchmarking, 
etc.  Respond politely but forcefully to press you think unfair; praise good 
reporting.  

o When you purchase a new system, ask the vendor to install OS/2 2.1, and to 
offer credit for dropping DOS and Windows.  If the vendor refuses, you may 
wish to take your business elsewhere.  Compaq, Everex, AST, Northgate, ALR, 
Unisys, Dell, Tangent, IBM, and Ariel Design all offer systems with OS/2 2.1 
preloaded.  

o Make sure your company (or yourself) specifies OS/2 compatibility when 
purchasing new products.  

o Demonstrate OS/2 to friends, relatives, and associates.  

o Ask your computer store to stock OS/2 software titles, have OS/2 
demonstration machines, etc.  

o Pass along useful OS/2 shareware and freeware to your local BBS.  Be sure 
to register OS/2 shareware.  

o Write an outstanding piece of shareware or freeware [See (4.5) Technical 
Support for details on joining DAP].  IBM has been known to recognize such 
work with rewards.  Also, ask authors of DOS/Windows shareware and freeware 
if they would port to OS/2, or volunteer.  

o Recommend products that work well under OS/2; dissuade people from 
purchasing products that do not.  

o Wear OS/2 pins, shirts, buttons, and other souvenirs.  Contact the 
Lees/Keystone OS/2 Merchandise Center (phone 914-273-6755 or FAX 
914-273-9187) or the IBM OS/2 Hotline (phone 800-3-IBM-OS2) to order such 
items.  

o Join Team OS/2, an international organization of volunteers who are OS/2 
enthusiasts and are actively sharing their knowledge and enthusiasm with 
others.  These activities include supporting OS/2 user groups, running OS/2 
BBSes and online conferences, demonstrating OS/2 at retail stores and other 
public places, encouraging and helping others to install OS/2, answering 
OS/2 questions, and much more.  Membership is not limited to IBM employees.  
For information on Team OS/2 events you should monitor the TEAMOS2 echomail 
conference on your local FidoNet BBS.  If your local BBS does not carry 
TEAMOS2, ask your system operator to get it.  See (4.11) OS/2 BBSes for the 
names and numbers of several BBSes which carry TEAMOS2.  To join Team OS/2, 
send your name, address(es), and telephone number to Vicci Conway (netmail 
76711.1123@compuserve.com or FAX 407-982-1229).  Include information on your 
activities to date and a one line description of yourself for the public 
Team OS/2 list.

(6.1) Creating INF Files

How can I create INF files?  

Creating INF files (like the OS/2 Frequently Asked Questions List) is 
remarkably straightforward.  All you need is the Information Presentation 
Facility Compiler (IPFC), part of the IBM Developer's Toolkit for OS/2 2.1 
(available separately as IBM Part No.  61G1416 or as part of many 
development environments such as Borland C++ for OS/2), and a text editor 
(like the Enhanced Editor included with OS/2).  

Online IPFC documentation is included with the Toolkit, but you may also 
wish to order the printed Information Presentation Facility Guide and 
Reference, IBM Publication No.  S10G-6262.  See (4.9) Books and Magazines 
for ordering instructions.  Note that the Toolkit is part of the low cost 
OS/2 Developer's Connection CD-ROM.  See (4.5) Technical Support for 
details.  

If you wish to include illustrations in your INF file you can use any 
graphics software which can generate OS/2 bitmaps and/or metafiles.  (For 
example, you may create your illustration in PM Chart, paste the 
illustration into Picture Viewer, then save the illustration as a metafile.  
Both PM Chart and Picture Viewer are included with OS/2 2.1.)  A screen 
capture utility [like PM Camera or Galleria, available from (3.2) Shareware 
and Freeware Sources] can also prove useful.

(7.0) Glossary

{{ The following terms are often used in conjunction with OS/2:  

  Term              Definition 

  APAR              A bug fix which has been (or will be) created by IBM to
                    address a very specific problem.

  CID               "Configuration/Installation/Distribution": a term
                    usually used to refer to the ability to install an
                    operating system or application remotely, over a
                    network.  (Example: "IBM TCP/IP 2.0 for OS/2
                    is now CID-enabled.")  See (4.2) Installing from Drive
                    B.

  CSD               "Corrective Service Diskette(s)": see (4.6) Corrective
                    Service Diskettes.

  DASD              "Direct Access Storage Device": disk space (most
                    commonly a hard disk drive).  (Example: "I do
                    not have enough DASD for this new application.") 

  DMA               "Direct Memory Access": circuitry provided on all PCs
                    to allow peripherals (such as disk controllers) to
                    transfer data to memory directly, without the assistance
                    of the computer's processor.  Appropriate use of DMA can
                    often help to improve overall system performance.

  EA                "Extended Attribute": up to 64K of assorted data stored
                    with any file under OS/2.  Such data may include file
                    type (e.g. "Plain Text"), icons, comments, and other
                    information which is best left outside the file itself.
                    Only OS/2 applications can create and modify extended
                    attributes.

  ES                "Extended Services": see (3.9) Extended Services. 

  FAT               "File Allocation Table": the disk format introduced by
                    DOS.  See HPFS.

  GA                "General Availability": available for purchase as a
                    shrinkwrapped product from IBM and its dealers.

  HPFS              "High Performance File System": see (1.5) High
                    Performance File System.

  IPL               "Initial Program Load": starting a PC's operating system
                    (i.e. booting or rebooting).  (Example: "Please IPL
                    your system now.")  See also RIPL.

  LA                "Limited Availability": available only from IBM to
                    certain customers.

  multitasking      Running two or more applications "simultaneously,"
                    dividing the computer processor's attention among them.
                    (In fact, the two or more applications only appear to 
                    run simultaneously because the processor switches 
                    between them rapidly.)  Cooperative multitasking, such 
                    as that found in Microsoft Windows and Macintosh System
                    7, requires that each application be written so as to
                    "surrender" the computer's processor at regular
                    intervals so that it can devote attention to other
                    running applications.  If one application for some 
                    reason refuses to yield the processor, all other
                    applications stop running.  Preemptive multitasking, as
                    found in OS/2 and Unix, for example, leaves the 
                    operating system in charge of delegating processor time
                    to each running application.  The amount of attention
                    given depends the operating system's scheduler, the
                    logic which assesses (and perhaps adjusts) the
                    priorities of various tasks and assigns processor
                    attention accordingly.

  multithreading    An operating system's ability to manage what are
                    sometimes called lightweight processes, namely subtasks
                    which are spawned by applications.  For example, a word
                    processor may be written so that any printing operation
                    is put in a separate thread.  This thread is then run
                    alongside the word processor itself, in the background,
                    so that control returns immediately to the user of the
                    word processor.  See multitasking.

  PM                "Presentation Manager": the underlying services used by
                    programmers and the Workplace Shell (see WPS) to provide
                    windows, scroll bars, dialog boxes, and other essential
                    interface elements.

  PMR               "Problem Management Record": a number assigned by IBM
                    to track a customer-reported problem. (Example: "I have
                    opened PMR Number 9X534; please reference this number if
                    you call again.") 

  RIPL              "Remote Initial Program Load": the capability to boot
                    (start) a PC (load its operating system) over a network.
                    See IPL.

  seamless          Refers to the ability to run Windows applications
                    alongside OS/2 and DOS applications on the Workplace
                    Shell (see WPS) desktop as opposed to the full screen
                    Win-OS/2 desktop.  (Example: "Will this video driver
                    support seamless Windows?")

  SMP               "Symmetric Multiprocessing": a set of technologies in
                    which two or more computer processors (CPUs) are managed
                    by one operating system to provide greater computing
                    power to applications.  With SMP, processors are treated
                    more or less equally (with applications able to run on
                    any or perhaps all processors in the system,
                    interchangeably, at the operating system's discretion).
                    Simple MP usually involves assigning each processor to a
                    fixed task (such as managing the file system), reserving
                    the single main CPU for general tasks.  OS/2 currently
                    supports so-called HMP (Hybrid Multiprocessing), a
                    version of MP which provides some elements of SMP, using
                    add-on IBM software called MP/2.  OS/2 SMP is slated for
                    release in late 1993.

  SP                "Service Pak": see CSD.  Sometimes numbered (e.g. "SP
                    2") to refer to a particular Service Pak.

  Win-OS/2          IBM's customized version of Windows, based on
                    Microsoft's own source code, which provides
                    compatibility with Windows applications under OS/2. 

  WPS               "Workplace Shell": OS/2's most commonly used user
                    interface which provides icons, folders, drag-and-drop
                    configuration, settings notebooks, and other features
                    necessary for user interaction with the operating system
                    and its applications.
