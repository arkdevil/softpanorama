                   OS/2 SALES SOAR IN EUROPE
                       Press Release from 1/3/95

 IBM today announced that sales of OS/2 Europe have increased by 120
 percent over the past twelve months. Over two million copies were sold
 in Europe between January and November 1994, and over 800,000 of OS/2
 Warp have been sold worldwide since the product's launch in October.

 Sales have been particularly robust in UK, France, Germany, Italy,
 and the Nordics. Dealers and distributors across Europe are reporting
 strong demand and sales.

 Here in the UK, Gem Distribution has experienced heavy demand. Paul
 Donnelly, Managing Direcotr, explains, "Since its release, demand for
 WARP has been good, with re-orders coming through rapidly, showing
 that the product is moving at retail point of sale. For the month of
 November WARP was our No. 1 performer on both media formats".

             CANADA BLOWS AWAY SALES ESTIMATES OF OS/2 WARP

 VANCOUVER, B.C., CANADA, 1995 JAN 20 (NB) via First! -- Canadian sales of
 OS/2's new Warp version have blown away IBM's estimates for the
 product. "We came in at 400 percent of our plan," Alan Hilliard, general
 manager of the software division of IBM Canada, Ltd., said
 Thursday in an interview with Newsbytes. The Canadian demand for OS/2
 is about twice that in the United States and elsewhere, Hilliard noted.

 With one tenth the American population, Canadians are buying twice
 as much OS/2 proportionately  as Americans. Hilliard attributes
 the strong demand to "pent-up demand" for a 32-bit operating system."
 Other options for 32-bit operating systems either require a much more
 powerful computer (Windows NT) or are too difficult for ordinary
 consumers (Unix).

 Warp's easy connection to the Internet is also important, given
 strong public interest in the Internet, Hilliard said. That picture
 is currently clouded by IBM's pricing for Internet access through
 the IBM-owned Advantis network. One questioner at an IBM breakfast
 Thursday, offered in connection with the  Comdex/PacRim computer
 show, criticized the company for charging the equivalent of $4 an
 hour for Internet access while local competitors  charge as little
 as $1.25 an hour. Don Myles, vice-president and general manager
 of IBM Canada's Personal Systems Division, said the company is
 examining its Internet access pricing.

 Microsoft's delays in shipping Windows 95, its own low-end 32-bit
 operating system, have also helped OS/2 Warp, Hilliard said.
 Microsoft recently announced another two-month delay, until August,
 for shipping Windows 95. At one point the next major revision of
 Windows was supposed to ship in 1994."With all the hype about
 Windows 95, Microsoft has created an unfulfilled demand," Hilliard said.

 SUMMARY OF ARTICLE FROM UPSIDE

 This is a summary of an article from the February 1995 issue of
 "Upside" pp52 - 67. 

 The premise of the article is that Microsoft's has a precise
 strategy to leverage its domination of one platform to gain control
 of the next platform. They state that Microsoft "targets particular
 markets, establishes marketing and, in particular, technological links
 to those markets from established monopolies, and then leverages its
 power to monopolize the target markets". An obvious example of this
 strategy in action on the client side is using Windows to leverage
 control of the market for desktop applications. Microsoft will use
 this same strategy to gain control of the server market, the
 intrabusiness server and the home-to-business server.

 The complete white paper prepared by the law firm Wilson, Somsini,
 Goodrich and Rosati of Palo Alto, California. The white paper is
