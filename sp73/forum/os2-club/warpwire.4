               OS/2 AND LAN SERVER VIDEOS AVAILABLE

 OS/2 WARP VIRTUAL UPDATE - This video was shot in Boca Raton with the
 OS/2 Warp development team and provides a strong, technical introduction
 to OS/2 Warp.  Topics include:

      *Introduction and Overview of OS/2 Warp, including installation
      *Support for DOS and Windows applications, including comments
       about performance and tuning OS/2 Warp for your applications.
      *Warp Device Support, including Plug-and-Play for PCMCIA, Resource
       Manager View (RMVIEW), and a glimpse of how RMVIEW will be
       implemented in future versions of OS/2 Warp.
      *Introduction and Overview of OS/2 Warp Multimedia.
      *Overview of the BonusPak, including demonstrations of Internet
       Access Kit and IBM Person to Person/2.

 This material is recorded on two VHS tapes (over 2 hours and 40 minutes)
 and is available for $49 by calling National Corporate Marketing at
 (800) 678-8014. 

 Special Bonus Video created as a companion for the OS/2 Warp Virtual
 Update, this video runs over one hour and includes:
      *Pen for OS/2:  OS/2 Warp and Pen for OS/2 provide users of mobile
       systems with a powerful combination, especially for applications
       where using a keyboard is difficult or impractical.  However,
       this video will show all PC users that Pen Computing is not just
       for special applications anymore.
      *A look at how OS/2 is used around the world with David Barnes,
       OS/2's number one fan.  David visits with OS/2 users in Alaska,
       Japan, Russia, and Europe and is shown mission critical applica-
       tions running on PCs that demonstrate the power and stability of
       OS/2.  But, as David learns, sometimes OS/2 is just waku waku.
      *Some interesting interviews with some very, very Warped people.



 LAN SERVER 4.0 VIRTUAL UPDATE - The IBM LAN Server 4 product has broken
 new ground by providing more power, performance, and ease of use than
 any other Network Operation System (NOS).  The topics of these videos
 will help LAN administrators evaluate the product and their skills.
 The topics include:
      *IBM LAN Server Hints and Tips, focusing on LAN management and
       performance issues, including discussion of the LAN Server Tuning
       Assistant included with LAN Server 4..
      *LAN Server 4 Graphical User Interface, an introduction to the
       new GUI front end to LAN Server and overview of the new functions
       and how they are implemented.
      *LAN Server Migration Tool, a simple and easy to use migration
       utility that helps LAN administrators migrate users from NetWare
       to LAN Server.  This utility makes it so easy that it is worth
       getting LAN Server just to have this smooth migration experience.
      *LAN Intensive Care Utilities (ICU), a LAN Server application
       developed by Lieberman Associates.  Phil Lieberman discusses the
       LAN ICU with Pete Greulich, IBM LAN Server Brand Manager, and
       explains how this package of utilities can assist LAN administra-
       tors so they can get home at a reasonable hour.

 This material is recorded on two VHS tapes (over 2 hours and 50 minutes)
 and can be purchased for $49 by calling National Corporate Marketing at
 (800) 678-8014.  

 Special bonus Video:  Over an hour of information about the LAN Server
 product, including market positioning, features of LAN Server 4 and how
 they match the requirements of large, medium, and small LAN users.  The
 video also includes discussions about IBM certification programs for
 products that work with LAN Server and skills certification for technical
 professionals who work in the LAN environment.
