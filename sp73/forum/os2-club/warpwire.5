 TO WARP OR NOT TO WARP
 John C. Dvorak, PC Magazine, 3-14-95

 Dvorak says Warp is not sexy, but it is reliable.

 HARD-CORE USERS OF OS/2 BYTE BACK AT COLUMNIST
 David Einstein, San Francisco Chronicle, 2-20-95

 Einstein received a great deal of negative response from OS/2
 users to his column "Advice for IBM -- Delete OS/2."  Einstein
 reversed his position to say that IBM's problem is not with the
 corporate world but with the mass-market where multitasking is
 not that important.

 BRIEFS:  BEATING WINDOWS 95 TO THE PUNCH
 Network World, 2-20-95

 The article reports that IBM could release OS/2 4.0, a version
 capable of running Windows 95 and Windows NT applications in
 August to steal attention from Microsoft's Windows 95 launch, but
 will more likely release a beta version in August.

 Similar coverage appears in the following articles:

 OS/2 WARP:  A TRUE ALTERNATIVE
 Thomas Mace, PC Magazine, 3-14-95

 "Warp has smoothed many of the rough edges that might once have
 deterred you, and our tests show it to be a robust and
 sophisticated platform for running Windows applications."

 HOT HITS
 Computer Retail Week, 2-13/20-95

 OS/2 Warp was the eighth best selling software title for the
 month of December.

 WHY BLOCK MICROSOFT?
 Brad Johnson, Advertising Age, 2-20-95

 Gates will stumble on his own.  "Windows 95, due in August, will
 inevitably have flaws common in new operating systems that could
 send disappointed customers into the open arms of already proven
 rival, IBM Corp.'s OS/2."

 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:  TOO MANY EGGS IN THE WIN 95 BASKET
 PC Week via First!, 2-22-95

 Reader doesn't feel sorry for developers who put all their eggs
 in Microsoft's basket instead of developing for Warp.

 INTERESTING TIMES TANTALIZE
 The Edmonton Journal via First!, 2-22-95

 With the operating system wars heating up, vendors are starting
 to realize that Windows isn't the only operating system out
 there, and are ensuring that their technical support staff are
 familiar with alternatives like OS/2.

                   WARP LAUNCHING IN JAPAN

 International Business Machines Corp's Japan unit will begin shipments
 of its OS/2 Warp personal computer operating system in Japan in March,
 IBM Japan Ltd said.

 'With Warp, IBM will take leadership in the next-generation software
 both in the corporate and personal user markets,' IBM Japan president
 Kakutaro Kitashiro told a news conference.

 OS/2 Warp is the third generation of IBM's 32-bit operating system that
 competes directly with Microsoft Corp's Windows 95.  IBM Japan aims to
 sell at least 500,000 Warp systems in the initial year, he said.

 Kitashiro said OS/2 Warp is expected to come preloaded on computer
 systems from PC makers such as NEC Corp, Toshiba Corp and Hitachi Ltd.

 The English-language version Warp was introduced in the US in November,
 selling one million units within a month and a half.

  A SUMMARY OF COMMON OBJECTIONS AND APPROPRIATE RESPONSES



 There aren't any OS/2 applications

     There aren't any Windows 95 applications, and very few Windows
     NT applications

     OS/2 runs more applications than any other operating system

     There are more 32-bit applications for OS/2 than for any other
     platform

     There will obviously be more applications for older platforms
     than for newer ones such as OS/2 or Windows 95

     OS/2 enhances existing DOS and Windows applications in many ways
     that Windows 95 doesn't

     IBM doesn't 'encourage' users to upgrade - runs DOS and Windows
     apps as well as OS/2 apps, reducing costs

 But Microsoft dominates the industry

     Business requirements should drive decisions, not marketshare

     DOS is predominant platform today - doesn't mean DOS is right
     solution

     Industry is moving to 32-bit operating systems, object-oriented,
     where IBM is market leader

     OS/2 users use OS/2 by choice because they know it's better -
     not like many Windows users who don't know better

     Industry is heterogeneous, it's not an either/or, win/lose
     world...

     Choose the solution that best meets needs for today and tomorrow

 OS/2 will not be able to run Windows 95 applications

     There aren't any Windows 95 applications

     Windows 95 will never run any of the more than 2,500 (and
     rapidly growing) OS/2 applications

     IBM can technically and legally implement any Windows API we
     choose to

     IBM implemented Win32s without access to source code

     History has shown that Microsoft has not been able to get ISVs
     to write to their 32-bit API

     Even if there are many Windows 95 applications, it is very easy
     for ISVs to provide OS/2 versions

     OS/2 has large enough marketshare that ISVs can no longer afford
     not to provide OS/2 applications

     Why does Microsoft have so many APIs and why do they keep
     changing?

     ISVs have hard time deciding which Windows APIs to write to and
     how to compete effectively with Microsoft

     Most 'Windows 95' applications are written to the lowest common
     denominator, Win32s, which doesn't exploit the unique features
     of the different versions of Windows and which OS/2 Warp already
     supports. So OS/2 Warp already runs many 'Windows 95'
     applications -- that aren't available yet

     IBM supports open industry standards, including DCE and OpenDoc,
     as well as proprietary Windows APIs

 IBM isn't committed to OS/2

     IBM has never wavered on our commitment to OS/2. More important
     now than ever before.

     Microsoft promoted OS/2, then Windows, then Windows NT, now
     Windows 95... where is their commitment?

     Lou Gerstner: "We have made, and will continue to make,
     significant investments in OS/2."

 IBM isn't committed to OS/2 since Windows NT will be an option
 for the PowerPC

     IBM recognizes heterogeneous world and provides many solutions
     that span platforms

     IBM firmly believes and maintains that OS/2 is a far better
     solution than Windows NT

     IBM is open and responsive to customers. We don't limit customer
     choices

     Microsoft does not provide applications for OS/2 in spite of
     market demands and their commitments to do so

 IBM has no single strategy (seven OSs - DOS, OS/2, AIX, OS/400,
 Workplace, Taligent, MVS)

     IBM offers one advanced operating system for the PC, with one
     API, and still enhances DOS for users who have not yet moved to
     OS/2

     Microsoft has four operating environments currently available
     (DOS, Windows 3.11, Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT) with
     Windows 95 on the way eventually

     Worse still, Microsoft offers at least four constantly changing
     APIs: Win16, Win32s, Win32c and Win32

     IBM addresses many more markets than Microsoft does, including
     mainframes and midrange systems. Reality is Microsoft addresses
     fraction of customer's requirements║

 OS/2 has poor support for networking

     IBM offers three versions of OS/2 Warp, one for networked
     environments. Objection is made relative to basic OS/2 Warp
     version without integrated networking. Just a question of
     packaging - not functionality

     Regardless of which packaging is chosen, OS/2 Warp provides far
     better connectivity than any version of Windows

     InfoWorld: "How well does an operating system get along with
     others in a network? The top grade went to OS/2 2.1. OS/2
     provided the broadest native connectivity of all the operating
     systems tested. OS/2 was the only operating system where we
     could get NetWare, LAN Server and TCP/IP running simultaneously
     and still be able to run all our OS/2, DOS and Windows
     applications with RAM to spare."

 OS/2 does not support OLE

     Absolutely false. OS/2 fully supports OLE

 OS/2 is difficult to install

     Earlier versions were more difficult. OS/2 Warp has more drivers
     and automatic hardware detection, and a 'one-button' installation

     OS/2 is very easy to install over a network, reducing support
     costs

     Most PCs have never had a real operating system. Any advanced,
     32-bit protected mode operating system is inherently more
     difficult to install smoothly on the millions of PCs already in
     the market. Latest delay in Windows 95 is due to compatibility
     problems, according to Microsoft

     OS/2 Warp is the most tested, robust 32-bit platform available,
     with broadest support for hardware and applications

 Windows runs faster than OS/2

     Many DOS and Windows applications run much faster with OS/2 than
     with Windows

     More importantly, OS/2 Warp is far more responsive than Windows.
     Users don't have to wait on their computer, allowing them to get
     more work done in less time

     OS/2 Warp is much faster and less resource-intensive than
     Microsoft's 32-bit operating system

 My customer is influenced towards Microsoft by what they've read
 in magazines or heard from consultants

     Decisions should be based on what solution best meets
     requirements

     Popular press is now very favorable towards OS/2 Warp, and many
     consultants now recommend OS/2 over Windows

     OS/2 has won more awards and praise than Windows. OS/2 is
     gaining momentum, with the market shifting from outdated 16-bit
     DOS/Windows to advanced 32-bit operating systems and object
     technology, where IBM is clear leader.

     Focus on requirements and proven, available products.

    FORRESTER THINKS WIN95 MAY SHIP AS LATE AS NOVEMBER '95

 In a brief on computer strategies, Forrester brings up the definite
 possibility that Windows 95 may not ship until November, 1995. Some
 of the indicators from which Forrester drew this conclusion are:

  - ISVs don't expect it until November
  - MS is running into problems with backwards compatibility and adding
    new mail, Internet and MS Network features
  - MS indicated they will deliver a new Windows 3.1 version of its
    suite product.

 The slip to November means that Windows 95 will miss the '95
 Christmas season with preloads. Although Forrester asserted that
 OS/2 will only gain marginal sales volumes from the delay, PC
 makers will want to have an exploitive operating system for the
 Christmas season and it looks like OS/2 Warp will be the only game
 in town.
