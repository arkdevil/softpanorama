          ZACHMANN'S SOFTWARE PREDICTIONS FOR 1995

 Will Zachmann has been making predictions about the computer industry
 since 1984. In the mid-eighties, Will's predictions about the future
 of IBM were less than comforting. At the peak of IBM's financial success,
 when many were expecting IBM to be a $100 billion company, Will
 predicted that IBM would run into serious financial trouble in the
 late 80's and early 90's. Unfortunately his predictions came true.

 Last year, his 1994 predictions were a lot easier for the IBM community
 to hear. And better yet, these predictions also proved valid. His
 1994 predictions included:
   - No (good) way to Chicago in 1994.
   - Further gains consolidated by OS/2
   - Neither Workplace OS nor Taligent a big factor in 1994
   - PowerPC off to a late start with Apple in the lead position
   - Microsoft's real troubles start by the summer of '94.

 Given Will's track record and the fact that his predictions for
 1995 are uplifting for IBM and OS/2, I'm including some of them
 in this newsletter.

   - IBM kicks some serious butt (Microsoft's)
   - WinEver off to a surprisingly weak start (slouching toward Chicago)
   - OS/2 Train Picks up steam

 For the complete text surrounding these prediction headlines refer
 to the Canopus Research Forum on CompuServe. For 1995, Will has produced
 a "1995 Predictions" document and will follow that with an
 "Industry Outlook 1995."  The full text of his 1994 predictions are
 available from Lib 2 of the Canopus Research Forum.

              LAN SERVER USABILITY ENHANCEMENTS

 One of the key goals of the LAN Server (LS) 4.0 release was to
 enhance usability.  Accordingly, most of the staff of the LAN
 Systems Usability Center was assigned to work on various
 aspects of this release.  At the height of our effort, seven
 human factors engineers worked full-time on the project,
 supported by at least six full-time lab assistants and an
 artist.

 The usability work that was done included:

 *  Reviewing LS 3.0
 *  Studying competitors
 *  Gathering customer requirements
 *  Supporting the design and publications work

 *  Prototyping and iterative testing of LS and DLS GUIs
 *  System testing

 From this and other work the useability enhancements included in
 LS 4.0 are:

 *  New DOS requester GUI

 *  New LS administration GUI:
    -  Drag/drop supported
    -  Includes most UPM and NET USER functions
    -  Can administer multiple domains concurrently
    -  Can modify access for multiple users/groups at once
    -  Enhanced management of logon assignments:
       -  Can manage access in same operation as logon assignment
       -  Can specify groups of users as targets
       -  Can also modify and delete assignments en masse
    -  Improved interaction with lists of objects
    -  Access external resources without batch files
    -  Improved DOS RIPL image tracking

 *  WPS extensions for network management (e.g., sharing)

 *  Improved network application support:
    -  OS/2 Users see the real application icons
    -  DOS and Windows settings can be modified for network applications
       run at OS/2 requesters.

 *  Improved LAN Services install:
    -  Integration of Multi-Protocol Transport Services (MPTS)
    -  Adapter sniffing
    -  Ships with support for many more LAN adapters
    -  Integrated creation of 386 HPFS recovery diskette
    -  Improved panel designs

 *  Directory (DASD) limits function and GUI

 *  Support for longer user IDs and computer names

 *  Publications
    -  New handbook to cover basic install and administration
    -  All books available online

 *  Improved authentication:
    -  Forwarded authentication handles just-changed passwords (requires
       undocumented settings)
    -  Backup domain controllers servers can handle DLR logons

 *  Expanded Command Line Interface (CLI) for full management capability

 *  New utilities for audit and error logs

 *  New messaging utility

 *  Network DDE and clipboard utility

 *  Many useful applets, including an access control manager

                OS/2 WARP PENTIUM FIX INFORMATION

 IBM is providing software for OS/2 Warp to assist customers
 concerned with the accuracy of the Pentium floating point
 operations. The fix actually disables the hardware floating point
 function. Floating point calculations are then done with software only.


 Customers can get access to it through various means.

  - CompuServe in library 23 of the OS/2 support forum
  - Prodigy under the IBM files in a section called fixes in the OS/2 Club
  - OS2 BBS ( a membership BBS) under OS2 fixes
  - PPC BBS ( a public BBS)
