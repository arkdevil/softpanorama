Bet you didn't know THAT TED TURNER would be among the first on the
information superhighway. The Prodigy on-line service (914-993-8000) has
teamed up with 20 cable networks, including CNN, The Discovery Channel,
and TNT, to provide services that augment cable-TV programming. Viewers
who have computers and modems will be able to provide feedback on their
favorite or least favorite programming via viewer polls. Viewers will
also be able to download program highlights and listings and talk to
other viewers on bulletin boards.

Not to be outdone by CNN, the Clinton administration has been making more
kinds of information available on-line. For instance, the Smithsonian's
National Museum of Art is using America Online (703-448-8700) to
distribute its journal American Art as well as Photo CD images from its
book of African culture Free Within Ourselves. The Smithsonian's New
Media Initiative has already created access to four other Smithsonian
units -- including the Air and Space Museum -- on America Online.

Title:     Apple, IBM, others start superhighway.
             (Apple joins computer vendors and telecommunications firms
             in Cross Industry Working Team) (Brief Article)

Washington - Apple has banded together with more than two dozen computer
vendors eager to start work on the data superhighway.

Last month Apple, AT&T Co., BellSouth Corp., IBM Corp. and others,
announced formation of the Cross Industry Working Team, or XIWT, a group
dedicated to accelerating the deployment of the electronic information
network.

Promoted by the Clinton administration and industry luminaries, including
former Apple CEO John Sculley, the data highway has been characterized as
a high-speed, high-bandwidth national network able to deliver digital
video and audio to millions of users.

XIWT, a membership organization with a $20,000 entrance fee, plans to
develop by this spring a white paper outlining ways to implement the
basic infrastructure required for the network, as well as recommendations
for pilot programs.

The new data highway will reportedly allow connections to the Internet,
the current international data network, but will operate at higher speeds
and implement stiffer security measures than those now in place.

Title:     Data highway hamburger.
             (information superhighway) (Levitations)
Author:    Levitan, Arlan


Abstract:  The information superhighway is mismanaged by the government.
           Internet is about to be opened to commercial use when the
           National Science Foundation's ban is lifted, and users will be
           overwhelmed by junk electronic mail (E-mail) and other
           electronic solicitations. In 1993, commercial accounts make up
           more than half of new Internet users. The Federal
           Communications Commission continues to sell parts of the
           frequency spectrum to private enterprise, leaving a paucity of
           bandwidth for free public amateur radio so that vacuous memos
           can be transmitted quickly. The objective of VP Al Gore's
           information infrastructure agenda is to foster private
           investment so that the infrastructure can be built, which
           allows for such detrimental monopolies as the Bell
           Atlantic/Tele-Communications International (TCI) merger.

Info Superhighway? Go Play in the Road

Hang onto your keyboards, folks. The year 1994 is going to be a bumpy
ride for anyone who was gullible enough to swallow the "Information at
Your Fingertips" gruel that's been spoon-fed to us for the last 12
months. There are more than enough wonderful surprises waiting in the
wings to cause one to suspect that George Orwell wasn't wrong--just off
by a decade.

The freewheeling Internet, which has evolved into the information channel
of choice for computing cognoscenti over the last 20 years, will undergo
a wrenching change this year, as the National Science Foundation's ban on
commercial use of the net is lifted.

If you think that flame wars of the past have been a waste of bandwidth,
just wait until junk E-mail and other electronic solicitations start
spreading faster than a brushfire through Laurel Canyon. Thousands of
businesses have made preparations to pounce on the buying power of
millions lining up for Internet access. For the last year, over half of
the new users jumping on the net have been so-called "commercial"
accounts.

Computer-hip staffers in the Clinton Administration established an
Internet address for correspondence shortly after taking office. The
connection is currently just one-way; don't expect an answer to your
electronic missive, but be assured that Big Brother has been watching the
net for awhile. Just ask the fellow in California whose angry and
admittedly tasteless comments about George Bush in one of Internet's
political forums last year prompted a visit from a pair of FBI agents the
next day.

Trust Us, We're The Government

The American people supposedly own the airwaves, but that hasn't kept the
Federal Communications Commission from selling off more of the frequency
spectrum to private enterprise every year. As a result, the small amount
of bandwidth that is currently allocated to amateur radio--the only venue
where communication of packetized data remains both public and free--is
being cut away more methodically than the Pacific Northwest's old-growth
forest. Of course, that's a small price to pay to allow millions of
wireless PIM owners to FAX mindless memos to each other.

In case you missed it, Al Gore and his buds released their long-overdue
term paper last September, entitled "The National Information
Infrastructure: Agenda for Action" and co-sponsored by Big Al and
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown (the original $6 million man). Critics were
quick to point out that the proposal had less meat on its bones than a
Frank Perdue reject.

According to the white paper, the government's primary role in building
our so-called information superhighway should be limited to fostering
private investment in building the requisite network infrastructure. If
"fostering private investment" means standing by and staring at the
ceiling while Bell Atlantic and TCI merge to create the world's largest
corporate conglomerate, I don't feel like hanging around for the dividend
check.

Instead of thousands of independent info-service suppliers, I suspect
we'll end up with the information equivalent of retail superstores:
close, convenient, canned data that's pasteurized, homogenized, and
predigested so there's no need to activate your neural paths. I don't
know about you, but I'm looking forward to the digital equivalent of HBO,
The Weather Channel, and Home Shopping Network about as eagerly as I
would a series of rabies shots.

"Don't worry," coos Washington. "We'll make sure that there's reasonably
priced, universal information access for everyone." Who's kidding who?
For five bucks a month tacked onto the average phone bill, poor kids will
get access to millions of pages of textual information that might help
them pull themselves up by their bootstraps--if their school cared enough
to teach them to read.

Only the well-heeled will be able to afford the slick, interactive,
MTV-format education that comes down the wire. That's just what we need:
a generation of nuclear physicists who matriculated from Beavis and
Butthead U.

Since the cosmos will be at our fingertips, there'll be no need to
venture forth into the real world. And since perception is reality, who
cares what's really going on outside? We'll be riveted to our comfy
computer recliners, watching cool interactive full-motion videos on the
grandeur of nature, while someone quietly strip-mines the Grand Canyon.

As our government spends time issuing vague policy statements, the
opportunity to build a nationwide information network that truly belongs
to the American people is fading faster than Ross Perot's run for the
White House.

The techno-politicians are like deer frozen to the asphalt, staring in
mindless fascination while fiber-optic headlights relentlessly bear down
on them. Road pizza, anyone?

Title:     Market reality turns visions to nightmares.
             (effects of marketplace on fruition of industry visions for
             future) (Channel Watch)
Author:    Humphrey, Charles


Abstract:  The new technological and distribution visions in the computer
           industry have suffered setbacks in 1993. The vision of a data
           superhighway held by the Clinton administration has turned out
           to be naive and ridiculous. Apple's former CEO John Sculley
           held to his vision of the Newton personal digital assistant
           and neglected its mainstay, the Macintosh, which now suffers
           from the strength of Microsoft Windows and the low prices of
           microcomputers. IBM's Louis Gerstner stated that his
           struggling company did not need vision. Intelligent
           Electronics' Richard Sanford devised the business model of the
           office-product superstore, but his vision has faltered under
           profit pressures. Visions must take the imperatives of the
           marketplace into consideration, and the successful ones are
           those that execute the business plan.

Last Year, PC Visionaries Got a Cold Dose of the Real World

That "vision thing," arguably the linchpin of the entire computer
industry, limped out of 1993 battered and bloodied. From Washington (the
capital of the nation) to Washington (the center of the PC universe) to
California, technological and distribution ideas were hammered by the
harsh realities of the marketplace.

For example, candidates Bill Clinton and Al Gore campaigned partially on
a vision of a data superhighway that would be all things to all people.
It was a naive, blank-page view of the world that crashed smack-dab into
the installed base of networks.

John Sculley, late of Apple, clung to his vision and pushed Newton out
the door. Unfortunately, the company's cash cow, Macintosh, was being
buzz-sawed by the twin blades of Windows and cutthroat pricing in the PC
world, which sliced off the Mac's technological advantage, and left it
bloated and overpriced.

Of course, one of the most damaging blows to vision was dealt when IBM's
chief executive, Louis Gerstner, frustrated by constant questions about
his view of the future, commented that vision was the last thing the
struggling giant needed.

Nor was vision spared the wrath of reality on the distribution front.
Richard Sanford, chief executive of Intelligent Electronics, the Exton,
Pa.-based franchiser/aggregator, had hoped to build a national chain of
office-product superstores featuring a product mix designed around the
core of future office technology--PC products--rather than consumables.

Success shattered that vision. True, BizMart drove PC products'
contribution to total sales up to 40 percent. Unfortunately, in a
business with storewide gross-margin requirements in the low- to
mid-20-percent range, the business model of the office-product superstore
failed to support the profit pressures of the PC industry. BizMart was
sold to Office Max, where strategists spent much of the year ruthlessly
paring PC sales back to roughly 12 percent of revenues.

I Had a Vision

Does all this mean that market visionaries should ignore their
inspirations, writing them off as the effect of overindulging in chili?
Absolutely not. But the environment within which visions must be applied
has changed dramatically.

Consider perhaps the single most fundamental shift in the channel last
year--which, ironically enough, can ultimately be traced back to Richard
Sanford's views of the world. It was he who pioneered cost-plus
franchising. Under this scheme, franchise fees based on a total,
bundled-value package gave way to a cost structure under which resellers'
payments were based on points over product costs. Additional charges for
value-added services were levied on a use-only basis.

This radical approach to the market, eventually embraced by all
franchisers, paved the way for the aggregator business, which was
essentially a distribution model. And when it first appeared nearly six
years ago, I, too, had a vision. But mine was based less on insight than
on simple business metrics.

Aggregation places franchisers in direct competition with distributors.
Distribution is an efficiency business, and no one distributes as
efficiently as distributors. Aggregators would thrive only as long as the
leading hardware vendors placed artificial authorization requirements on
the channel. When those barriers were toppled, and distributors were
approved to sell top-name systems, aggregators would fall.

At the same time, I conjured up a scenario in which a leading distributor
would amass its own network of captive customers, imagining that as the
most cost-effective way to move product from point A to B. Both those
"visions" took shape late last fall when Merisel signed an agreement to
buy the franchise business of ComputerLand for a cool $110 million.

Vision Tempered By Market

All this suggests that there's still a place in a fast-maturing market
for vision. But those visions must be applied to the imperatives of the
marketplace, and the visionaries that succeed will not be those with the
longest horizon, but rather those who execute the business plan.

Which brings us back to Apple. John Sculley paid for his commitment to
his vision by losing his job. Apple's business model demanded that
management focus on fixing the competitive erosion damaging the
Macintosh, rather than introducing a new computing paradigm.

Nevertheless, Sculley's dream has merit. With all its initial warts,
Newton remains a successful introduction. By October, Apple was reporting
that 50,000 units had been sold. Newton was simply a less-than-perfect
implementation of a vision that undoubtedly will be corrected. After all,
how many revisions did it take before Windows ultimately conquered and
changed the market?

PC industry visions are not all predestined to serve as the butt of
"Doonesbury" comic strips, as did Newton. Not, at least, when they are
applied to real-world applications and successfully implemented.

Title:     Zenith's PC-to-cable link brings data highway home.
             (Zenith Datasystems' Homeworks PCTV-R modem) (Brief Article)
Author:    Vaughan-Nichols, Steven J.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full Text:

Another access ramp recently added to the coming "data superhighway" is
Zenith's Homeworks PCTV-R. This new modem/network scheme en-ables you to
transmit and receive data over standard coaxial TV cable.

Cable wiring's biggest allure is raw speed. A single data channel can
fire data at up to 0.5 megabits per second (Mbps), and the effective
throughput is closer to 2 Mbps, thanks to multiplexing. That's a lot
faster than ordinary modems, which plod along by comparison at 0.192
Mbps.

The robust speed and bandwidth of products like Homeworks will help turn
multimedia wide-area networking into a reality, say market analysts. PC
systems linked to cable TV via Homeworks-type modems may be the future of
community data/video networks.

Homeworks can send or receive files, data, and programs without
interrupting one moment of "The Simpsons." A standard cable splitter
funnels broadcast signals to your TV, data to your PC. You'll need the
Homeworks modem, of course, and the network will require a Homeworks
central unit, or hub, to manage traffic.

The device's potential already has attracted developers such as Spry,
with its Windows-based AIR Navigator for Internet access. Working in
tandem with Homeworks, AIR Navigator can tap the Internet's E-mail
system, newsgroups, and file-hunting programs at speeds previously
reached only by dedicated Internet sites.

Among several cable companies reportedly interested in Homeworks is the
giant Tele-Communications Inc., which is currently testing the product in
Utah.

Title:     Fit to print: choosing a personal or color printer.
             (includes related articles on workgroup printers, ecological
             aspects, consumer advice, resolution and color inkjets)
Author:    Stone, M. David


Abstract:  The first step towards buying a printer is determining which
           technology is best for the kind of work that is done. The two
           most common choices are personal black-and-white printers for
           desktop microcomputers and inexpensive color printers.
           Dot-matrix printers are noisy and produce low print quality,
           but inkjet printers use a kind of dot-matrix technology that
           eliminates those problems, although inkjet-printed documents
           are prone to smudging. Laser printers use specks of toner
           rather than drops of ink, so there is no problem with
           smudging. Resolution is an important consideration when
           shopping for printers. The standard for business laser
           printing is now 600-by-600 dpi, while inkjets are just
           beginning to achieve 600-by-300 dpi. Inkjets have the unique
           ability to offer black-and-white printing as well as
           high-quality color at an affordable price. Paper, ports, fonts
           and memory influence the buyer's choice as well.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full Text:

This is supposed to be the age of the electronic superhighway, but your
business still runs on paper, and your printer is your most important PC
peripheral. More than with any other kind of computer hardware, buying a
printer is an exercise in making choices: With most other equipment, the
main factor is how much money you have to spend, with more cash buying
more performance or capacity. With printers, you face fundamentally
different options--your printing needs can throw your price
considerations out the window.

If you want to print on multipart forms, for example, you'll have to get
an impact dot matrix printer, and put up with the mediocre output quality
and racketing noise that even the best and quietest matrix printer makes
compared to other technologies. At the other end of the spectrum, if you
want the finest photo-realistic color output, you may need a
dye-sublimation printer--which means high initial cost, reliance on
specially coated stock instead of standard copier paper, and buying a
second printer for black-and-white work.

In short, although the usual issues of price and performance (meaning
speed and print quality) are important, your first priority in choosing a
printer is to determine which technology best fits your needs.

In this Shopper's Guide, we'll look at the two liveliest parts of the
printer market--personal black-and-white printers for desktop PCs and
affordable color printers. The latter range from personal printers to
networkable publishing and presentation resources for office use. (See
the sidebar "One Printer, Many Users" for a look at heavy-duty,
network-oriented black-and-white office lasers.) We'll follow the same
pattern you'll use in making decisions--concentrating first on issues
that'll help you pick a technology, and then on particular printer
features.

Dot Matrix: Don't Bother

Dot matrix, once the workhorse printer and the sole choice for graphics
output, is fading into history as laser and inkjet prices continue to
fall. If you doubt it, look at the latest low-priced printer from dot
matrix king Epson--the Stylus 300, an inkjet with a street price around
$200.

The sad truth is that even today's much-improved dot matrix printers are
noisy, and their print quality is no match for inkjet printers. Their
only advantage is their ability to print multipart forms, where you need
an impact to make an impression through multiple copies.

If that's what you need, you're stuck with dot matrix technology; the
best advice is to get the best bargain you can among 24-pin matrix models
with the narrow- (8.5x11-inch) or wide-carriage (11x17-inch) paper
handling you need. Nonetheless, because impact matrix printers occupy
such a narrow niche these days, we'll ignore them from now on.

Technically, inkjets and lasers could be called dot matrix printers,
too--they form letters and graphics from a matrix of tiny dots, printed
one line at a time with inkjets and one page at a time with lasers. But
since they produce finer dots, and in most cases more dots per inch than
impact matrix printers, inkjets and lasers produce more fully formed text
characters and more finely detailed graphics.

Putting Dots On Paper

Inkjet printers form dots by spraying drops of ink from small nozzles.
Most inkjets use heating elements to vaporize the ink, forming a bubble
of expanding gas (think of the bubbles in boiling water) that forces a
drop out of the nozzle. Epson's Stylus 800 uses a different, piezo-based
technology, using vibrations to contract an element, creating pressure
that ejects ink drops.

How the printer forms and aims ink drops is only part of the
print-quality factor. Use a porous paper, for instance, and drops will
tend to bloom as they soak into the paper, leading to a slightly fuzzy
appearance. In fact, inkjet drops tend to bloom a bit in any
case--despite comparable resolution, even the best liquid ink naturally
yields less crisp results than laser printers' toner.

Water-soluble liquid ink also introduces a smudge factor. On early
inkjets like Hewlett-Packard's original DeskJet, you could actually
see--and, naturally, smear--the wet ink if you printed a graphic with
solid black areas. HP and other manufacturers have worked hard to
formulate quick-drying, less smudging inks, but you can still smudge an
inkjet page if you rub it with a damp finger or handle it immediately
after printing (especially in humid weather). One possible exception to
this rule, not yet available for testing at this writing, is Lexmark's
new IBM ExecJet II. Lexmark claims the ExecJet's ink uses a dye that's
water-soluble in an alkaline environment, but not in the acidic
environment typical of most paper stock.

Laser printers are smudge-free because their dots consist of specks of
toner instead of drops of ink. Lasers--as they're collectively called,
though some use LED or LCD instead of laser technology--are
electrophotographic printers. That means that a light source is used to
electrostatically charge a rotating drum with an image of the page. The
drum picks up toner particles and transfers them to paper, where heat
fuses them to the paper.

Big Dots, Little Dots: Resolution

When it comes to output quality, the type of dots isn't as important as
their size, measured in terms of dots per inch (dpi). Other things being
equal, higher resolution means crisper edges for text and graphics, fewer
"jaggies" in diagonal lines, and more shades of gray for better-looking
images, with fewer dithering patterns (combinations of adjacent dots that
fool the eye into seeing gray shades).

Formerly, the standard resolution for laser printing was 300x300 dpi--and
300 or 360 dpi is the value most inkjet printers tout when advertising
"laser quality." When HP introduced its LaserJet 4, the standard for
business laser printing shifted to 600x600 dpi (a level not widely
matched by inkjets, although a few, such as HP's DeskJet 1200C, offer
600x300 dpi).

The change is largely due to a new generation of laser printer engines,
which provide higher resolution at a slightly lower price than the
previous crop of 300-dpi en-gines. Along with these new 600-dpi units,
however, has come a new batch of still less expensive 300-dpi lasers,
with street prices dipping close to $500.

Do you really need 600-dpi resolution? If most of your printing is plain
text, with most of that in the 10- and 12-point font sizes of business
correspondence, odds are you won't see any difference between 300- and
600-dpi output unless you look very closely. On the other hand, if you
use small or large type--below 8 points or above 20 points, say--the
difference in quality becomes obvious, with characters appearing crisper,
cleaner, and better formed.

The difference is even clearer with graphics. For business charts and
line drawings, lines and edges appear smoother to all but the briefest
glance (particularly diagonal lines, which show far fewer jaggies at 600
dpi). Dithered output for continuous-tone images like photographs also
looks much improved, thanks to less visible dithering patterns.

The bottom line is simple: For everyday text printing, a 300-dpi printer
is almost certainly good enough, though higher resolution is preferable.
For desktop publishing or high-quality graphics output, you'll probably
want 600 dpi. (For a look at even higher-resolution printers, see the
sidebar "Dots Enough: Beyond 600 dpi.")

Sometimes, however, there's more to dot size than dots per inch. HP's
LaserJet III introduced a trick called Resolution Enhancement Technology,
which has since been adopted by other vendors under other names (Lexmark,
for in-stance, calls it Print Quality En-hancement Technology). This
feature concentrates on improving edges--smoothing curves and minimizing
jaggies by strategically placing smaller dots in spaces ordinarily left
between dots. Some printers also offer a similar function for gray-scale
enhancement, using sophisticated dithering patterns to increase the
perceived resolution of continuous-tone images.

Resolution enhancement provides a more obvious benefit at 300 dpi than at
600 dpi. Even at 600 dpi, though, the difference is obvious. Again, if
all you print is 10- or 12-point text, you needn't worry about it;
remember, too, that a 600-dpi printer without enhancement should easily
outdo a 300-dpi model with resolution enhancement. Still, if you want
top-quality output, it's a feature worth looking for.

The Black-and-White Choice: Inkjet or Laser?

Which technology should you choose for your black-and-white personal
printer? Laser printers have two general advantages over inkjets: higher
print quality at equivalent resolutions; and speed. There's a good deal
of overlap in speed between the best inkjets and the lowest-priced
lasers, sometimes concealed by the fact that many inkjet vendors give
speeds in characters per second (cps) rather than lasers' pages per
minute (ppm).

Some inkjet manufacturers do list performance figures in laser-like
terms--Canon, for instance, rates its BJ-200 at 4 ppm, and Lexmark claims
3 and 6 ppm for the IBM ExecJet's high-quality and draft modes,
respectively.

For all printers, remember that advertised throughput is always higher
than the real thing--claimed speeds are based on simple printing of text
using a printer's internal fonts, and don't consider the time involved in
moving paper through the printer. Nor does text speed translate into
graphics speed. Complex graphics can demand considerable processing. For
heavy-duty graphics printing, look for a printer with a built-in RISC
processor to speed the process of creating the page image.

To determine the minimum print speed you're willing to live with,
consider how many pages you have in a typical job and how long you're
willing to wait for it. If you rarely print anything longer than a
two-page letter, a 3-ppm inkjet may be fine. If you often print 40-page
reports, you may need nothing less than a 10-ppm laser.

They trail lasers in speed and quality, but inkjets are better bargains.
List prices for monochrome inkjets run from about $350 to $800, barely
overlapping the lowest-priced lasers, and street prices are well below
that. On the other hand, inkjet printers cost a bit more to use than
lasers, with their ink cartridges yielding a higher cost per page than
lasers' toner cartridges. The typical cost of a laser page is about 2
cents (with 5 percent coverage of the page area); Epson claims that its
Stylus 800 is the thriftiest of inkjets, averaging 3 cents per page. (See
the sidebar "Ecology: Printers for a Small Planet" for more about
consumables.)

Inkjets also have an edge in portability; Canon, IBM, and Hewlett-Packard
all sell inkjet printers designed specially for on-the-road use. Their
typical battery life is meager--Canon claims only 30 pages per charge for
its BJ-10ex, while HP promises 100 pages per charge for its DeskJet
Portable--but you can always plug them into a hotel-room or office wall
socket, and they're small and light enough for easy traveling. (So,
Panasonic claims, is its brand-new SideWriter KXP-5400, an AC-only
LED-based printer.)

If you decide to go the laser route, be aware that the line between
low-cost personal lasers and more traditional and expensive office laser
printers is getting fuzzy. In general, personal lasers offer speeds of 4
to 6 ppm, 300-dpi resolution, and 100- to 150-sheet input trays, for list
prices between $800 and $1,300. Business lasers, by contrast, usually
deliver 8- to 12-ppm performance, 600-dpi printing, and bigger paper
bins, with list prices starting at $1,300 and climbing to $2,000 or more.

Printers from the classic business laser category can be shared on small
networks, but depending on how prices overlap, you can just as easily
consider one for use as your desktop printer if you need a little more
speed or resolution than so-called personal lasers provide.

Pretty as a Picture

Before definitely deciding on a laser instead of an inkjet, however,
consider one more factor: inkjets' ability to put sharp black-and-white
printing and increasingly high-quality color in the same affordable
package.

Not long ago, the only route to respectable color was a color-only
printer, and the least expensive of such models--with prices in the
$3,000 to $4,000 range--were color inkjets. These could print charts on
standard copier paper, yet produced washed-out colors on transparencies,
and they couldn't print plain black-and-white text at all.

The big news in color over the past year has been the arrival of new
inkjets that offer both text printing at reasonable speeds and impressive
color at reasonable costs. The DeskJet 550C is Hewlett-Packard's most
economical example, but its color quality is less than ideal; Canon has
taken dead aim at the 550C with its new BJC-600, which combines 360-dpi
resolution and respectable 170-cps text printing with a street price
around $650.

Moving a notch higher, HP's DeskJet 1200C has a street price of about
$1,350, and offers output--on transparencies as well as copier
paper--that matches what you'd expect from a more costly thermal wax
printer. And its speed of 6 ppm for high-quality text makes it a valid
alternative to some personal lasers.

High-Class Color

Color inkjets are terrific values for presentations and simple graphics
work, but more serious desktop publishers and creative
professionals--people who don't mind buying one printer for color work
and another for correspondence--have lots of even more colorful options.
The next step above color inkjet printing, and the traditional business
choice for high-quality color, is thermal wax transfer technology.

Usually priced at $3,000 to $6,000, thermal transfer printers produce
rich, fully saturated colors on transparencies as well as on specially
coated stock. Resolution is typically 300 dpi. Thermal printers don't
handle continuous-tone images very well, showing visible dithering
patterns in scanned photos, and they don't qualify as inexpensive. Yet
their prices today are over 20 percent lower than they were a year ago.
Fargo Electronics' Primera is a thermal wax transfer printer priced at
just $995.

The next step up--and a fairly big step, with prices near $10,000 despite
similar declines over the past year--is dye-sublimation technology. (Last
summer, Kodak set a low price point for dye-sublimation printers by
pricing its ColorEase PS under $8,000.)

Dye-sublimation printers, sometimes called thermal dye transfer printers,
are known for producing photo-realistic, true-color output, with pages
that look like color photos. They work by vaporizing and merging dyes,
rather than ink or wax; the dyes diffuse into and are ab-sorbed by
specially coated paper or transparencies, yielding true continuous tones
with no dithering. As a result of the process, these printers used to be
known for blurry edges in lines and text, but the newest crop of
dye-sublimation printers has eliminated those problems.

Dye sublimation would be the unquestioned champion of color printing, if
only its high purchase price weren't equaled by its high cost per page.
Including the pricey coated paper, dye-sublimation output can cost $2.10
to $5.90 per page, compared to 50 cents to $1.50 for thermal wax transfer
and as little as 15 cents for color inkjet printing.

If the jump from thermal wax to dye sublimation is too great for you,
there's a middle step between the two technologies: solid wax printing,
which melts blocks of wax and then sprays it onto the page. With an
ink-jet, the ink dries by evaporating; with solid wax, it hardens by
cooling. The process provides output approaching the photographic quality
of dye sublimation, yet retaining the sharp edges of graphics and text,
with no need for specially coated paper. Unfortunately, once you get past
Dataproducts' $6,695 Jolt PS and Textronix's $9,995 Phaser IIIxi, solid
wax printers are hard to find.

It's difficult to accurately compare the cost per page of solid wax
printers to their rivals, since they use ink sticks or pellets. By
contrast, thermal wax and dye-sublimation printers use rolls of ribbon
sheets, with page-sized sections of colors--cyan, yellow, magenta, and
sometimes black.

Why "sometimes" black? Three-color (cyan/yellow/magenta, or CYM) printing
is faster, since the printer needs three rather than four passes to
produce an image, saving in ribbon cost. Four-color (CYMK) printing
produces a more solid black, rather than mixing a brownish or bluish
black from the other three colors. Note that color inkjets use only a
single pass no matter how many ink colors they use, so for inkjets, you
would have absolutely no reason to use anything but four-color printing.

Finally, there's the ultimate in color printing: color lasers. QMS has
just introduced the first affordable (well, almost affordable) color
laser, the $12,499 ColorScript Laser 1000, which produces excellent
300-dpi color in a single pass, while approaching 8 ppm for
black-and-white text. Still, though the QMS is only one-third to
one-quarter the price of its forebears from firms like Canon and Xerox,
it's safe to say that color laser printing is still a year or two away
from mass-market affordability. For now, if you want color and monochrome
printing in a single package, inkjets are your only real choice.

Paper, Ports, Fonts, and Memory

Once you've decided on the printer technology that best fits your needs,
you can concentrate on the features that different printers within a
category can offer. Some issues are fairly straightforward. Under the
category of paper-handling, for example, you'll want to know how much
paper the input and output trays can hold--buy a personal laser with a
skimpy 50-sheet tray, and you'll be a member of the Frequent Refillers
Club. If you need to print on B-sized (11x17-inch) paper, your printer
choices--among both inkjet and laser models--are far fewer than those
built for 8.5x11-inch paper.

Check whether you can easily feed single sheets such as letterhead,
mailing labels, and envelopes; a printer that handles envelopes
gracefully, instead of jamming at the sight of one, can be a blessing.
Several printers offer adjustable paper trays that hold envelopes; some
even include special envelope feeders.

Still, if you print a lot of enve-lopes or labels and can't afford to
grapple with a balky printer, you might want to consider a printer made
especially for addresses, such as Seiko Instruments USA's Smart Label
Printer Pro, Avery Dennison's Personal Label Printer, or CoStar's Address
Express. Such devices even come with special Windows-based address- and
label-printing software, and free you from having to change or adjust
feed trays in your primary printer.

Compatibility with your computer and software, of course, is critical. On
the hardware side, you'll want to make sure the printer offers the proper
ports--parallel, serial, AppleTalk, or network-specific--for the
connections you need. As for software, most printers come with up-to-date
drivers that let Windows and other programs take advantage of all their
features. Having to rely on more generic compatibility, such as emulation
of an older HP LaserJet or Epson dot matrix printer, is a distant second
choice.

On a related matter, you'll want to consider the printer's control
language. The standards for laser printers are PCL, the Hewlett-Packard
printer language, and Adobe's PostScript, which is popular for desktop
publishing applications (especially for users who need to create files
that will print the same way on their desktops as on a professional print
shop's or typesetter's system). A few printers skip both PCL and
PostScript in favor of GDI (Graphical Device Interface), the internal
code Windows uses to format both screen and printer output; such printers
are highly efficient with Windows, but unusable with DOS applications.

Note that PCL and PostScript come in several flavors. The older, more
limited PCL 4 is the version HP used in the LaserJet Series II; PCL 5 is
the more capable version in the LaserJet III and 4 models. As for
PostScript, the key difference between Levels 1 and 2 is the latter's
support for standard color mapping, making PostScript Level 2 the most
popular choice for high-quality color printers. Note, however, that there
are a variety of other color-matching standards, such as support for
Pantone-certified colors in printers designed for the professional
artists' market.

Fonts are as important an issue as color and compatibility--and another
reason to look for specific software drivers, since relying on, say, a
control language borrowed from a dot matrix printer may limit your choice
of fonts. Check how many fonts are built into the printer; whether
they're scalable (meaning you can scale them to any size, as with
PostScript fonts) or bit- mapped (supplied in a few fixed sizes); and
whether the printer can accept additional font cartridges or downloadable
fonts. If you use Windows and a Windows printer driver, you can always
use Windows' scalable TrueType fonts, but they may not give the fastest
performance.

Another feature you'll want to check is the amount of memory in the
printer--an important consideration for pages with large, complex images
or lots of downloaded fonts. A 300-dpi PCL laser printer, for example,
needs at least 1Mb of onboard RAM to print full-page graphics. A 600-dpi
printer needs at least 2Mb and preferably 4Mb. Very high-end printers let
you add an onboard hard drive so you can store fonts in the printer
rather than on your PC's hard disk.

And don't forget to find out about up-grades. You might not need extra
RAM or PostScript support now, but if you think you might, make sure you
can upgrade your printer rather than having to throw it out and buy
another.

Hard Copy Ahead

Forecasting printer trends is dangerous--a while back, for instance,
pundits predicted a flood of all-in-one printer/scanner/copier/FAX
products, but Okidata's Doc-It has been a lonely pioneer for many months.
Still, keep an eye out for several near-term trends. Most predictable is
a continuing drop in prices for any given speed or resolution.

The mix of monochrome and color is the best argument for buying an inkjet
printer instead of a laser. But don't count out lasers--their unbeatable
speed for high-volume printing will keep them well-established as office
workhorses, while plunging prices will ensure that personal lasers remain
a solid option for users who can get along without color. And when color
laser prices move a few thousand dollars lower, things will really get
interesting.

Come to think of it, who needs an electronic highway? Choose the right
technology for your needs, and you'll have the satisfaction of a printer
on your desk and pages in your hands for years to come.

One Printer, Many Users

Low-cost personal printers can bring laser and near-laser quality to
everybody's desktop, but high-resolution, high-speed lasers remain the
office printers of choice for businesses needing the convenience and
money savings of shared printing. For a networked environment, printers
capable of high-volume output at 12 ppm or more, with RISC processors and
ample onboard memory to speed graphics and large print jobs, provide
quick output for all your users--even if they have to leave their desks
and walk down the hall to fetch it.

When shopping for a network printer, keep several things in mind. Look
for flexible, high-capacity paper handling, dual paper bins holding 500
sheets or more, and, ideally, duplex printing (i.e., on both sides of the
paper).

Bidirectional communication, which lets a printer inform users of its
printing status (or tell you before you send a document that the printer
is out of paper), is the next big trend. Later this year, you may find
printers bearing an NPA logo--the symbol of the Network Printing
Alliance, founded in April 1991 by Intel, Lexmark, Texas Instruments, and
Insight Development. At press time, the group was awaiting IEEE approval
of its proposed specification for a bidirectional printing protocol,
which would provide a standard set of printer-to-host commands to
exchange status, control, and configuration information.

For heavy-duty work, it's important to check the manufacturer's duty
cycle rating--how many pages the printer can produce before needing a
tuneup.

The more people sharing a printer, the higher the duty cycle you'll want.
A cycle of 50,000 pages per month or more will ensure that the printer
handles peak loads with minimal downtime.

It's more convenient to connect the printer directly to your network than
to hook it to a network server or a specific workstation. Many printers
are now available with standard or optional Ethernet or Token Ring as
well as serial, parallel, and Mac LocalTalk connections, plus automatic
emulation switching for juggling incoming PCL and PostScript jobs on the
fly.

If need be, add a print server to speed up print jobs and act as a
print-queue traffic cop. A print server attaches to the printer's
parallel port or fits into a PC's expansion slot, letting the printer
itself act as a server and eliminating the need to dedicate a PC for
print-queue management. Nonetheless, don't forget that print speed is
affected by network speed.

As with any printer purchase, your network checklist should include
enough memory to handle long print queues, plus a large assortment of
fonts. Furthermore, several office printers now combine printing with
plain-paper FAX capability. This can be a boon, unless your office
receives non-stop FAXes, which tie up the printer and leave it
un-available for its original use.

Compaq, QMS, DEC, and Hewlett-Packard have long been leaders in network
printing. As the LaserJet 4 is rapidly reclassified as a personal instead
of shared printer, HP offers the 17-ppm LaserJet 4Si MX. Compaq and DEC
offer 20-ppm Pagemarq and PrintServer models, respectively, while QMS's
3225 is a 32-ppm heavyweight.

Not only is choosing a network printer an important issue, but so is the
way you set it up. Try to find a convenient, uncluttered space, with easy
access for all. Having your documents land in printing purgatory isn't
fun, but with careful shopping, you just might avoid it.

Ecology: Printers for a Small Planet

If the '80s motto, as spoken by Michael Douglas' character in "Wall
Street," was "Greed is good," the phrase for the '90s is "Green is good."
Last April, President Clinton dictated that government agencies must buy
computer products compliant with the Environmental Protection Agency's
Energy Star program. And you too can help conserve energy and cut your
electric bill by buying green--and, although most Energy Star products so
far have been PCs and monitors (see this month's feature on green PCs),
printers are getting into the act.

The Energy Star standard dictates that a printer's inactive power
consumption must be below 30 watts (45 watts for color printers and those
operating faster than 15 ppm). Companies like Apple, Canon, Compaq,
Dataproducts, Hewlett-Packard, Kyocera, and Lexmark--which together
account for 80 percent of printers sold in the U.S.-- have voluntarily
joined the program. Nevertheless, even a year after the first Energy Star
stickers started popping up, there's no one clear path to "green"
printing.

Both a printer's power consumption and the recyclability of its
consumable components contribute to a printer's environmental
impact--and, significantly, to its operating costs. Kyocera has focused
on waste reduction; the firm's 10- and 18-ppm Ecosys line of laser
printers use amorphous-silicon drum technology, which lets the imaging
drum last the life of the printer instead of being replaced along with
the toner cartridge. Kyocera claims the cost per page is cut down to a
penny.

Hewlett-Packard's 300-dpi, 4-ppm LaserJet 4L and the PostScript 4ML
version are the first HP LaserJets to qualify for Energy Star approval.
Laser printers rely on electricity to provide the heat that fuses toner
on paper. The 4L's "instant-on" fuser uses 5 watts in idle mode, as
opposed to the 40 watts used by the LaserJet IIP.

Similarly, Canon says its new small- or home-office laser printer, the
LBP-430, has an on-demand engine that needs virtually no warmup time,
saving 35 to 90 percent in energy costs. Canon has started a Clean Earth
Campaign for toner recycling, while Hewlett-Packard now markets
remanufactured toner cartridges.

You can also save money and help the environment without buying a new
printer. Consider recycled paper; lately the quality has risen, while the
price remains below that of new stock.

Shopping Tips

Unless you absolutely need a printer that can handle multipart forms, dot
matrix is as dead as vaudeville. An inkjet printer is the best choice for
bargain hunters, although even the best inkjet's output is not quite as
crisp as a laser printer's.

On the other hand, inkjet technology is the best way today to get both
high-quality color and crisp black-and-white text from one printer.
Thermal wax transfer printers offer rich, sharp color for offices with
sufficient presentation or publishing volume to justify the purchase of a
separate color printer. Dye-sublimation printers offer photo-quality
color printing for Cadillac budgets.

When it comes to resolution, the difference between 300- and 600-dpi
laser printers isn't very noticeable if you print mostly text in 10- or
12-point sizes. For small or large type and for graphics, however, 600
dpi--or 300 dpi with resolution enhancement--looks sharper.

Don't take advertised printer speeds literally, but use them as relative
figures to compare different models. To convert characters per second to
pages per minute, divide by 50 (for 3,000 characters per single-spaced
page)--Epson's 110-cps Stylus 300, for example, translates to 2.2 ppm.

Graphics always take longer to print than text, so a printer with its own
RISC processor is a good choice for heavy graphics work. Graphics,
downloadable fonts, and print queues all hog memory, too, so look for at
least 2Mb for a 300-dpi laser and 4Mb for a 600-dpi unit.

The greatest software compatibility issue today is not a printer's native
language or built-in fonts, but the availability of up-to-date Windows
drivers. (Windows takes care of scalable fonts for you.)

Beyond Windows support, serious desktop publishing users--especially
those who need to transfer files across platforms or to print
shops--should look for PostScript, particularly PostScript Level 2 for
color printing. For general business printing and DOS application
support, look for compatibility with Hewlett-Packard's PCL 5.

Keep in mind the cost of consumables such as paper, and ink or toner
cartridges. Inkjets cost more per page than lasers. Some color printers
can cost close to $6 per page.

Don't forget to check paper-handling capability: how many pages a
printer's input and output trays hold, whether you need to print on
B-sized (11x17-inch) paper, and how well the printer handles envelopes
and labels.

As with any purchase, check all applicable warranties, tech support, and
return policies. If possible, visit a vendor's online forum to see what
current customers have to say.

Dots Enough: Beyond 600 dpi

When does laser quality become typeset quality? If you thought 300-dpi
resolution looked good, but realize that 600 dpi looks better, you may be
tempted by laser printers offering even higher 800- or 1,200-dpi
resolution.

Mathematically, doubling a printer's horizontal and vertical
resolution--from 300 to 600 dpi, for example--actually increases
resolution by a factor of four (from 300x300 or 90,000 dots per square
inch to 600x600 or 360,000). Redoubling the resolution to 1,200x1,200 dpi
brings another fourfold increase in density, to 1.44 million dots per
square inch.

This is why ultra-fine printers require, in addition to print engines
capable of such resolution, lots of onboard memory: A full (completely
black) page of graphics--8.5x11 inches, with 0.25-inch margins--at 300
dpi requires 0.9Mb worth of dots. The same graphics image at 1,200 dpi
represents 14.4Mb of data.

The impression of crisper, more readable text comes from any number of
small details. With headline-sized type, for example, the sweeping curves
of a capital U appear ragged to the naked eye at 300 dpi, but much
smoother at 600 dpi. With small type sizes, characters begin to lose
separation at 300 dpi, making text harder to read.

For dithered graphics, the difference is more dramatic. Dithering, which
uses a matrix of dots to form each perceived dot or pixel of a gray-scale
image, reduces effective resolution sharply. A dithering matrix of 5x5
dots, for instance, cuts a 300x300-dpi printer down to 60x60. The same
matrix on a 600x600-dpi laser yields an effective resolution of 120x120.

Basically, the ratio between increased resolution and perceived
improvement follows a law of diminishing returns. So, while the jump from
300 to 600 dpi produces a relatively subtle difference in text quality,
the jump from an effective 60 to 120 dpi produces a much more dramatic
improvement in dithered output.

By the same token, an increase from 600 to 1,200 dpi has a small,
noticeable effect on text, while the increase in effective resolution for
dithered output, to 240 dpi, can be quite dramatic.

In this context, it's worth pointing out that typeset quality is
generally considered to be 1,200 dpi and above. If you want the best
possible output--and are willing to pay for it--you can get better than
600-dpi output today. In particular, the 600-dpi Accel-a-Writer 8100 from
Xante (1-800-926-8839) is $3,995, but you can upgrade it to 1,200 dpi for
$2,700. NewGen (1-800-756-0556) also offers a 1,200-dpi printer, the
ImagerPlus 12, for $7,495.

Eventually, 1,200--and even 2,400 dpi--will likely become standard, even
for low-end personal printers. If you're serious about desktop publishing
or extremely high-quality graphic output, you may want to consider higher
resolutions even now.

Inkjets Dominate Desktop Color Printing

Color inkjet printers, led by entries from Canon, Eastman Kodak, Lexmark,
and especially Hewlett-Packard, dominate the market for personal color
printers. According to market-research firm Infocorp, inkjets will
continue to lead sales through 1997, though their current three-quarter
share of the market will slide to something over half. As personal color
lasers hit the market, Infocorp forecasts their popularity will grow
quickly, claiming an impressive 18 percent improvement in market share in
four years. Thermal wax transfer printers, on the other hand, show a slow
and steady market-share increase of about 2 percent per year.

Title:     Tune in, pop around: riding on the information highway.
             (one of six articles in '2010: the Future of Networks')


Abstract:  The information superhighway of the future will connect most
           US homes through a high-speed network and will be used
           primarily to deliver entertainment, which means there is quite
           a bit of money to be made mass-producing inexpensive,
           entertaining products and services. The gigabit-per-second
           national backbone makes bandwidth a non-issue; basic services
           will cost about $65 a month, but a per-M-bps charge will be
           levied for transmissions exceeding 500Mbytes in a month at a
           speed of more than 45M-bps. Applications for the network
           include movies on demand, personal home videos, video
           shopping, interactive games, education, and information
           publishing. The superhighway will not be used by leading-edge
           companies for internal communications because they need more
           control over their information and higher levels of security
           and privacy. Superhighway service providers are described.

Title:     Build your own: private networks, private use.
             (one of six articles in '2010: the Future of Networks')


Abstract:  The information superhighway will not meet the needs of
           business for delivering information because the cable/phone
           companies will build it primarily for home entertainment
           applications. Businesses need reliable, flexible information
           services and the ability to ship terabytes of data per day, so
           they will rely on their own expertise and the skills of their
           systems integrators to create private networks for both
           internal communication and business-to-business communication.
           Companies need to own their own networks to gain competitive
           advantage; intercompany networks among favored trading
           partners provide a significant edge. Asynchronous transfer
           mode (ATM), clear-channel T-4, or some other form of wide-area
           bandwidth will be leased from wide area network (WAN) service
           providers. The desktop computer of the future is described.

Title:     The road to 1994 is paved with good intentions.
             (New Year's resolutions for others in the computer industry
             to keep)
Author:    Schwartz, Gil


Abstract:  Various parties in the computer industry should make New
           Year's resolutions for 1994 that would improve the industry.
           Hardware manufacturers should not hire such a low proportion
           of support staff to sales staff so that customers can receive
           excellent service not only before they buy but after as well.
           Peripherals should not come with cards configured to default
           at Interrupt five or seven, since most sound cards and LPT
           devices are assigned to these interrupts. Software
           manufacturers should limit their programs to a reasonable size
           and should call patches, fixes and kludges product recalls
           rather than upgrades, releasing them with an apology. CD-ROM
           software should especially bring something new to users.
           Peripheral manufacturers should make all their products comply
           with the small computer system interface (SCSI) standard.

Before we can say "posttraumatic holiday disorder," 1994 will be upon us,
full of new challenges, new hardware and software, new hypes, new gripes,
new ways to spend wisely or waste foolishly that most precious of
commodities: time. Another year dead. Another year ahead. There's only
one way to deal with it. No, we're not talking about eating, drinking,
and playing Spear of Destiny until we keel over onto the industrial
carpet. That's a year-round thing. Today we're talking about indulging in
the formulation of good, solid resolutions that shape our hopes and
dreams for the year to come.

So let's . . . resolve!

Except for one thing. I have very little interest in making and keeping
the same old stupid resolutions--do you? I thought not. How much better
would it be to suggest some great intentions that others can keep.

Be it resolved that hardware manufacturers shall not get away with hiring
one tuna-stained tech support guy for every 1,800 sharkskin salespeople,
requiring poor, unsuspecting customers (who up until they plunked down
their moolah received exemplary service) to sit on hold until moss grows
beneath their buttocks when their motherboards fail after two days of
infrequent use. Or their modems utilize a proprietary command set. Or
their B: drives won't read low-density disks. Use of the message, "All
our tech support people are currently on the line. Please hold and your
call will be answered in the order in which it was received," followed by
30 minutes of insipid new age music and obnoxious, jolly sales pitches
will be punishable by ten days of listening to Vice President Al Gore
talk about the information superhighway.

And while we're at it, be it resolved that no peripherals shall come with
cards configured to default at Interrupt 5 or 7. How stupid can you be?
Don't you know that just about every sound card and LPT device is
assigned to one of those locations? And speaking of which, you know those
tiny little jumpers that leap off your thumb when you're trying to move
them around the board and lodge themselves behind the 3,000-pound
credenza, effectively disabling the entire mechanism before you even
installed it? Lose 'em!

Be it resolved also that the folks who bring us our tasty software make
at least a tentative effort to limit the size of their programs to
something reasonable. I mean, come on! At this point your basic program,
no matter how negligible its purpose, must contain at least four
high-density 3 1/2-inch floppies compressed to hold as much information
as Exit 3 off the Internet. The installation process takes as long as the
construction of a small barn. Even when the Moby Dick-sized monster comes
on CD-ROM, the eventual spread it occupies on your overwrought hard drive
puts a Sumo wrestler to shame. All to note down where you're supposed to
have lunch with Mr. Finster, or to catalog all employees with bad teeth
for a study of future dental costs.

And be it in addition resolved that any patch, fix, or kludge that must
be issued within eight weeks of a major software release not be referred
to as an "upgrade" at all, but as a "product recall," with mandated
"We're very sorry for your trip to the mental institution that resulted
when your entire video function was disabled by the way our kernel uses
high memory" announcements to be made in all major computer magazines,
including of course this one (even though I think you'll agree it's
gratifyingly fat already).

And oh yeah, be it really resolved that all CD-ROMs bring something
interesting to the table, and not merely be inert repositories of boring
writing, minuscule pictures, and video clips of alarming brevity. The
function of these things is to haul information retrieval into a newer,
bolder, more immediate form-- not simply replicate the dry, juiceless
exercises that made our school days an ongoing fight against narcolepsy.
Those who fail to meet this resolution shall be forced to scan 24-bit
tiff files of insects until they weep.

Be it further resolved that manufacturers of scanners, hard drives, tape
drives, CD-ROMs, and other peripherals will be taken out behind the
boathouse and flogged if their machines do not easily comply with the
SCSI standard, making them impossible to daisy-chain and requiring a
proprietary board that hogs a whole slot and doesn't work with the
fabulous software drivers from Corel and others. I'm talking about you,
Nikon! Get with the program!

Finally, let's make the appropriate parties resolve to cut down on
blue-sky, dreamscape cyberchat that paints a future bearing no
resemblance to anything that normal people can understand. Possibly let's
resolve to take a break from the entire concept of virtual anything
unless we want folks to think we're nothing more than consultants
attempting to generate a living by making other people feel more stupid
than we actually are. Are you listening, Mitch Kapor?

Of course, as is only fair, I have a few reasonable resolutions of my
own.

I resolve to be Pentium-ready, even when I feel like dozing off after a
hard day at the office.

I resolve to be equally open to the promise of OS/2 and Windows NT for as
long as it's absolutely necessary.

I resolve to have a vision, even if Lou Gerstner says I don't need one.

'Nuff said.

Title:     A TCP/IP map of the data superhighway.
             (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) (includes
             related article on TCP's connection-oriented features) (PC
             Week LABS: Tech View) (PCWEEK Netweek)
Author:    Chernicoff, David P.


Abstract:  The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol's (TCP/IP)
           overall design and functioning merit description, now that
           many industry observers see it becoming the national data
           superhighway's principal transport system. TCP/IP is not a
           single thing, but rather a suite of protocols. The Internet
           Protocol (IP), which carries data between two systems without
           first requiring their connection, is fundamental. IP does not
           guarantee the data will reach its destination, however, though
           it tries its best to do so. Neither can it break large packets
           down into smaller ones for transmission, or recover lost or
           damaged packets. IP does support routing and error control.
           Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) runs atop IP to provide
           connection-oriented services. It ensures that data reaches its
           destination, no matter how many hops and how much division
           into smaller packets are required. TCP also uses flow control
           to prevent data overloads at the receiving end. The common
           Internet services FTP and Telnet run on top of TCP.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full Text:

Now that we're all being asked to meander down the national data
superhighway, it's time we became familiar with the services it will
offer travelers, as well as where it can take us.

Trade and business publications talk about TCP/IP as the transport on
this highway, giving short shrift to the fact that TCP/IP is a suite of
protocols rather than a single entity. The Transmission Control Protocol
(TCP) sits on top of the Internet Protocol (IP) and provides
connection-oriented features not available simply through IP.

IP is a connectionless protocol that allows data to be passed between two
systems without a prior connection. However, IP does not provide
guaranteed delivery of the datagram (also called Protocol Data Unit, or
PDU); rather, it offers only a "best-effort" attempt at data delivery. If
the datagram is lost or damaged, IP contains no mechanism for recovery.

IP does support fragmented PDUs. This support allows the IP to break
datagrams into a size that is appropriate for the type of network
connection being used. Such an ability is very useful in the WAN
environment -- without it, WAN gateways would have to handle all packet
fragmentation.

Along with the packet-fragmentation service, IP also provides a number of
other services, such as the Internet header-check routine, which checks a
datagram for a valid IP header, that help render the network invisible to
the user. If everything passes these checks, the destination address is
checked and the packet is transmitted. If the datagram fails any validity
check, it is discarded.

Datagram routing

The IP gateway also makes routing decisions based on the routing list. It
is capable of routing within the local network or to other networks.
Routing is generally done based on a distance metric, which is often the
lowest number of hops between networks. IP can also use source routing.
Source routing allows a protocol at a higher layer to determine how IP
routes the datagram. IP is also capable of recording the route traveled
and time-stamping the datagram.

The ICMP, or Internet Control Message Protocol, provides IP's error
control. ICMP reports errors in PDU processing and also provides some
administrative and status messaging. ICMP can report when no host is
found or if the lifetime of the PDU expires.

Because most systems use a connection-oriented protocol, TCP is used to
provide these connection-oriented services. TCP is designed to run over
IP, providing the guaranteed deliverability needed in many environments.
In other words, TCP is responsible for the transmission of data from
originator to receiver, be it across one or multiple networks.

The services commonly thought of as part of the Internet, such as FTP,
Telnet, and SMTP, all sit on top of TCP. That is, they use TCP as the
transport protocol to implement their services. TCP, in turn, uses IP to
transfer data, while retaining responsibility for managing the network
connection.

TCP gets information from the levels above it as a data stream, one byte
at a time, which it groups into TCP segments. These segments are then
passed to the IP layer.

On the receiver side, TCP also handles flow control, to prevent buffer
overrun (which could result in lost data), or saturation of the receiving
system. This is done using a windowing mechanism that provides a value to
the transmitter; this value informs the transmitter how many bytes can be
transmitted before it must pause.

TCP/IP became much more widespread in the business community when the
practice of loading multiple-protocol stacks started to become
commonplace. For example, in PC Week Labs, we run an IPX/SPX stack to
connect to our Novell Inc. NetWare network, a NetBIOS stack to access
Lotus Development Corp. Notes servers, and a TCP/IP stack to connect to
an Oracle Corp. database that resides on a Digital Equipment Corp. VAX.

Because we use a Windows-based IP implementation, our multiple-protocol
stack can be loaded and unloaded dynamically; this affords us the luxury
of not using a large amount of memory unless the IP stack is needed.

Running TCP/IP allows PC Week Labs analysts to access newsgroups on the
Internet, as well as glean information from anonymous FTP sites
throughout the world. The Labs can also set up systems as FTP sites and
function as peer servers to other users within our organization.

Title:     Acrobatic kids.
             (Adobe's 'Kids Take the Digital Road' software grant program
             donates Adobe Acrobat software) (Brief Article)
Author:    Levin, Carol

Look at any social studies or geography textbook in any classrom in
America today, and chances are it's hopelessly out of date. That's
because updating texts to keep pace with world events is too expensive.
Now, software companies and publishers are hoping that technology can
solve the problem.

Adobe's new "Kids Take the Digital Road" software grant program is a $5
million donation of Adobe Acrobat software to public schools
(800-521-1976). Its goal is to get more electronic information into
classrooms and to establish Acrobat's .PDF (portable document format) as
the standard format for electronic documents.

Acrobat is just one of the many programs that publishers are using to
digitize books and documents. There's also Farallon's Replica, No Hands
Software's Common Ground, Voyager's Expanded Book, and the SGML standard.
Acrobat preserves a document's look and feel across platforms (see PC
Magazine, November 9, 1993).

Electronic document software means texts can be produced, distributed,
and updated at a fraction of the cost of paper format. Acrobat will let
students create their own electronic "portable" newsletters and reports
for on-line distribution.

Kids' publications such as Sports Illustrated for Kids and The Wall
Street Journal, Classroom Edition, are now experimenting with the idea.
And the California Technology Project's Guide software, a graphical
Internet front end, has incorporated Acrobat to open up a vast array of
original materials from the Library of Congress archives.

But roadblocks remain, such as wiring classrooms for phone lines and
getting more PCs into schools so kids aren't left in the dust of the
electronic superhighway.

Title:     Step up and claim your role in building the new highway.
             (information superhighway)
Author:    Hill, Thomas


Abstract:  Corporations and governments as well as public and private
           enterprises should have the opportunity to help shape the
           information highway. The design of this future interstate
           commerce platform for providing goods and services naturally
           ought to reflect the ideas of those buying the goods and
           services. These consumers can ask their suppliers to provide
           data through electronic data interchange (EDI), and they can
           install Internet and other public data network connections.
           They ought to offer gateways to public electronic-mail
           (E-mail) networks as well. E-mail addresses should be
           published. These users should also take advantage of the
           services offered by telephone and cable companies, which can
           provide low-cost connectivity to public networks.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full Text:

Recently, one of my fellow Corporate Partners discussed what the
information highway was going to look like. I would like to enlist your
help in building it. The information highway is the future interstate
commerce platform for providing goods and services to corporate,
government, private, and public enterprises. Everyone has a role to play
to bring the highway into being.

As a buyer of goods and services, you can request your suppliers to
provide your company with data via EDI (electronic data interchange).
Have your company install connections to the Internet and other public
data networks. Provide gateways to public E-mail networks, and publish
your sales force's E-mail addresses. Have your sales personnel collect
E-mail addresses from their customers, and have them make those addresses
available to management.

On the home front, check into the services that your telephone and cable
companies are offering. Give them a call and let them know that you are
interested in low-cost connectivity to public networks. Ask them about
their plans for introducing high-speed connections into the home via
cable or ISDN services.

If you are considering building a new house, tell your builder that you
want category 5 cabling installed. After he responds with "huh?", hand
him a Black Box catalog and show him what it is. The additional cost is
minimal, and the wiring will support the computers and cable equipment
that are coming down the road.

Government information is quickly becoming available on BBSs and the
Internet. It ranges from federal agency bulletin boards to the Securities
and Exchange Commission filings on the Internet. Try out the NTIA
(National Telecommunications and Information Administration) at (202)
482-1199.

Our schools and libraries are building connections to allow people to
browse the shelves and request books to be placed on hold. Soon these
publications will be available on a computer screen near you. The
publishing community is currently testifying to Congress about the use of
electronic media on the information highway.

As a parent, introduce your kids to your computers and modems. Let them
try out a bulletin-board service or two to get the feel of it, and let
them show you what they find. Become involved in the PTA and push for
their schools to get connections to the Internet. We may putt along the
information highway, but our kids will soon be cruising it like Main
Street.

I've outlined a number of possible roles for you in building the
information highway. Select the one that appeals to you and pursue it
with a passion. Hope to see you in the fast lane.

BELLCORE TAPS GROUP TO COLLABORATE ON NII

Bellcore, backed by the seven RBOCs (Regional Bell Operating Companies)
and retail, broadcast, computer, and telecommunications providers and
research labs, last week formed the Collaboratory on Information
Infrastructure, to transform NII (National Information Infrastructure)
technologies into working prototypes.

Collaboratory members include Capital Cities/ABC Inc., ABC News, Digital
Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., J.C. Penney Co., Los Alamos
National Laboratory, the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Microware Systems Corp., Northern Telecom Inc., and WilTel
Communication Systems Inc.

Members will work with Bellcore "to develop prototypes that will
eventually lead to parts of an information superhighway," said Barbara
Kaufman, manager of marketing communications for Bellcore in Morristown,
N.J.

Current prototypes include a J.C. Penney on-line shopping service and a
news-on-demand service with ABC News. HP and DEC will work on consumer
devices for use with the NII, Kaufman added.

Title:     Bellcore to its owners: don't hang up.
             (Bellcore executive George H. Heilmeier pressured by Baby
             Bell bosses)
Author:    Coy, Peter


Abstract:  George H. Heilmeier is not content to handle the pressures of
           managing Bellcore, the research and development consortium
           founded by the seven regional Bell operating companies (RBOC),
           and is ready to take on the ambitious Information Superhighway
           initiated by the Clinton administration. Heilmeier was hired
           by Bellcore in Mar 1991 to cut operational costs and move the
           consortium away from academic to more business-related
           pursuits. At a time when the RBOCs are reducing funding for
           Bellcore and threatening to take their software business to
           other vendors, Heilmeier is moving ahead with plans to produce
           a 'Collaboratory,' which will consist of a joint study
           undertaken by Bellcore and other telephone companies and will
           center on consumer-related issues regarding the Information
           Superhighway.

           communicator access to information superhighway.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full Text:

EO Inc., an AT&T company, has reached an agreement to acquire Pensoft
Corp., the leading developer of information management software for the
EO Personal Communicator.

EO, producer of the world's first Personal Communicators, will use
Pensoft's database architecture as a central information repository to
expand communications services and enable content delivery from the
information superhighway for its devices. EO will also continue to market
and support Perspective, Pensoft's information manager, which is already
designed into every AT&T EO Personal Communicator.

"Pensoft's data architecture, combined with EO's wireless access to the
nation's information superhighway, is a powerful enabler for content
publishing," said Alain Rossmann, president and chief executive officer
of EO.

"Pensoft has developed a breakthrough product with Perspective, and
simultaneously created a data environment that allows customers with AT&T
EO Personal Communicators to retrieve, store and manage a rich fabric of
information from stock quotes and airline schedules to multimedia data."

With a built-in modem and a cellular telephone, AT&T EO Personal
Communicators use the cellular or wired communications infrastructure to
allow users to place calls and send and receive faxes and electronic
mail, anywhere, anytime.

"The acquisition of Pensoft strengthens EO's market position," said David
Atkinson, AT&T Consumer Products vice president of personal
communications.

"Through EO we are bringing together the best technology components from
companies such as Pensoft, as well as from AT&T Bell Laboratories, to
build Personal Communicators that are the next generation of intelligent
cellular phones. The strength of Pensoft's data architecture and their
understanding of the communications challenge make this an ideal blending
of efforts."

"We have worked aggressively over the past several years to create a
compelling information environment for communications intensive
professionals," said John Zeisler, president and chief executive officer
of Pensoft. "With this acquisition, Pensoft's technical and marketing
teams can accelerate the product development process."

At the closing of the agreement, most of Pensoft's employees will become
employees of EO Inc. Robert Roblin, Pensoft's vice president of
marketing, will assume the duties of EO's vice president of marketing,
reporting to Rossmann, effective immediately.

In June 1993, AT&T purchased a majority interest in EO Inc. On Aug. 13,
1993, AT&T announced the intention to merge EO Inc., and GO Corp.,
developers of the communications-oriented PenPoint operating system, into
a single company with the technologies to

deliver Personal Communicators.   This represents a major step

toward creating a new standard for this emerging market, offering
customers compelling communications-oriented products.

EO Inc., headquartered in Mountain View, was founded in 1991 by AT&T;
Palo Alto, Calif.-based venture capital firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield
and Byers; Matsushita; and Marubeni. The partners contribute technical
and marketing expertise and funding. In addition, EO has announced a
strategic partnership with Olivetti, Europe's leading computer
manufacturer.

Title:     SONET: AT&T intros first high-speed nationwide SONET service.
             (introduces first inter-LATA Synchronous Optical Network
             service called ACCUNET T155) (Local Access and Transport
             Area)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full Text:

The first inter-LATA Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) service will be
available nationwide in more than 200 locations, AT&T announced Monday.

Following a successful trial with Comdisco Disaster Recovery Services,
AT&T is adding a SONET service called ACCUNET T155 to its ACCUNET family
of data communications services. The T155 service offers the highest
network speeds available today over the most reliable network
infrastructure in the industry.

T155 operates at the standard SONET OC-3 rate of 155 megabits per second
(mbps) and is supported by the unsurpassed service restoration capability
of AT&T's FASTAR system. In the event of a service disruption due to a
cable cut or natural disaster, FASTAR (Fast Automatic Restoration) can
find alternate routes and in most cases restore service over a new path
within minutes.

"Sophisticated data applications are accelerating the need for additional
bandwidth," said Robert Aquilina, marketing vice president for ACCUNET
Data Communications Services. "This trial demonstrates that SONET is
ready today to handle customers' long

distance high-speed applications.   Further, it brings us one step

closer to establishing the data superhighway of tomorrow."

The AT&T and Comdisco trial tested the end-to-end interoperability and
capabilities of SONET equipment and service using a variety of disaster
recovery applications. The trial was conducted between Comdisco
facilities in Wood Dale, Illinois and Carlstadt, New Jersey. Ameritech
and New Jersey Bell provided local access links while AT&T provided the
ACCUNET T155 Service for the inter-state connection.

"The trial went flawlessly," said John Sandberg, vice president
networking products and services for Comdisco Disaster Recovery Services.
"We are testing applications that will provide our customers with new
services and capabilities and help them maintain a competitive edge.
ACCUNET T155 gives us the speed and the reliability necessary to achieve
that goal."

The trial utilized a variety of equipment from multiple vendors including
ATM switches, DS-3 multiplexers and channel extension devices.

Medical imaging, super computer communications, and high definition TV
are some of the emerging applications that will use high-speed SONET
transmission capability. At 155 mbps, a medical X-ray can be sent across
the country in under a tenth of a second.

In addition, ACCUNET T155 can be used to combine data applications from
multiple local and wide area networks over a single line, giving
customers greater economies of scale than are now available.

The service will be available under tariff upon customer request. The
price of the service is based on the city-to-city path that the customer
purchases. Flexible term and volume discounts will

be available.   Generally, T155 prices will be 10 to 15 percent

below the price for equivalent bandwidth provided through ACCUNET T45
Service.

AT&T will use the ACCUNET Customer Service Centers to manage and maintain
the T155 service. Expert technicians, who are familiar with the
customer's network, monitor the service 24 hours a day, seven days a
week.

In addition, the AT&T Service Assurance Warranty will apply to ACCUNET
T155. The warranty offers customers credits on the monthly cost of their
service for any outage of a minute or longer in length. Credits for a
single outage can be up to 50 percent of the service cost.

Title:     The not-so-distant future of personal computing.
             (Enterprise Computing)
Author:    Markoff, John


Abstract:  Microcomputers were once scorned by computer professionals as
           toys for hobbyists, but eventually came to dominate business
           computing and cause a revolution with massive social
           implications. InfoWorld magazine in its early years emphasized
           the fact that young entrepreneurs saw themselves as
           revolutionaries. The microcomputer is now the establishment;
           each new generation of microcomputers is more powerful than
           the previous one. Xerox Corp's Palo Alto Research Center
           (PARC), which invented the graphical user interface, the mouse
           and the local area network, is now pursuing 'ubiquitous
           computing' technologies which will embed tiny computers in
           office tools that communicate over wireless links. The
           microcomputer as we know it will eventually become extinct,
           replaced by networked and portable systems. IBM's losses and
           the collapse of such vendors as Wang Laboratories Inc were
           caused by the mainframe and minicomputer vendors' inability to
           respond to the impact of microcomputers; some of today's
           computer vendors could suffer similar consequences if they
           ignore the impact of new communications technologies.

This issue marks the 15th anniversary of InfoWorld.

We at InfoWorld have watched the PC progress from a mere curiosity to an
essential element in the corporate computing arsenal.

The PC revolution has truly taken hold. We are now witnessing the eclipse
of the proprietary and rigid computer systems that have run American
businesses for decades.

Organizations increasingly are relying upon distributed PC systems to run
their most critical and demanding business operations.

Through the years, we've witnessed many trends: Stand-alone PCs have
given way to networked desktops capable of sharing and accessing a
diverse array of information; graphical user interfaces have replaced
character-based interfaces; islands of automation have evolved into
diverse systems of interconnected computers.

And the revolution continues, with radical changes just over the horizon.

To commemorate our 15th anniversary, we asked New York Times reporter and
InfoWorld alumnus John Markoff to share his vision of the future of
personal computing. Here's a look at what may be in store for businesses
and computer users:

Fifteen years ago, when Jim Warren, the impresario of the West Coast
Computer Faire, founded InfoWorld's predecessor, Intelligent Machines
Journal, he was at the leading edge of a remarkable political and social
movement that created the personal computer industry.

In the late 1970s, personal computing emerged from the garages of a
ragtag band of hobbyists determined to wrest computing away from the
locked doors of corporate America. Legendary computer designers such as
Steven Jobs, Stephen Wozniak, George Morrow, and Lee Felsenstein wanted
their own computers -- not terminals connected to sheltered mainframes.
And so they created companies to build their dream machines.

InfoWorld reflected the uniqueness of the new industry. In its early
years the weekly newspaper styled itself as a cross between a Sports
Illustrated and a Rolling Stone, celebrating the fact that the young
entrepreneurs who were building the personal computer business believed
they were engaged in a technological revolution that would have
tremendous social consequences. Time magazine dramatized the point when
it named the personal computer "Man of the Year" in 1983.

THE ESTABLISHMENT. Since then personal computing has grown into a $60
billion industry, becoming a remarkably potent and pervasive force in the
world. But all revolutionaries age and lose their vitality, and the
personal computer is no different. Just as personal computing has
displaced earlier generations of computers, technologies certain to
change the way we compute in the future are on the horizon.

More powerful hand-held computing and communication devices will
encourage worker mobility but also provide some mind-boggling challenges
to computer professionals charged with managing this new infrastructure.

In addition, massively parallel computers will drive businesses into a
new era of efficiency -- bringing with it new challenges.

Like the mainframe and minicomputer before it, the personal computer
emerged from a steady progression of semiconductor innovations. According
to Moore's Law, postulated by Intel Corp. vice chairman Gordon Moore,
since the late 1960s the number of transistors that can be stored on a
silicon chip has doubled every 18 months.

Each new generation of personal computer is more powerful than the
previous one and spawns a new wave of software applications, in what
Intel chairman Andrew Grove calls the "power spiral."

Moreover, there is an important corollary to Moore's Law: Joy's Law,
coined by Sun Microsystems Inc. Cofounder Bill Joy. Joy's Law states that
the peak computing power in any year can be expressed as a simple
equation: MIPS = 2 [raised to the power of the current year minus 1,984].
MIPS is a measure of computing speed that stands for million instructions
per second. Ten years ago when Joy made his claim, the fastest
microprocessor was about 1 MIPS, and many people laughed at his audacity.

A decade later, the fastest workstations are approaching 300 MIPS. Will
there be a 1,000-MIPS computer by the end of the 1993? It's possible.

Several quiet Silicon Valley start-ups have been exploring radical new
computer designs that may put the power of a supercomputer on a single
chip.

At the same time, watching this remarkable power spiral, most people have
forgotten that each new computing standard -- first the minicomputer and
then the personal computer -- has cannibalized the previous one.

The history of the electric motor provides the best analogy to describe
the fate of the PC. There was a time around the turn of the century when
most factories used a central electric motor to power, via a series of
belts or gears, a variety of different tools.

Look around your home or office today and try to count the electric
motors. They're everywhere -- in your appliances, car, and perhaps watch.
They are ubiquitous.

The abundance of motors is similar to the new vision of computing held by
scientists at Xerox Corp.'s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). During the
1970s, led by computer scientist Alan Kay, researchers at PARC fashioned
many of the most important ideas in personal computing -- the graphical
user interface, mouse, and LAN.

THE NEXT WAVE. Two decades later, PARC researchers are pursuing a set of
technologies they call "ubiquitous computing." In PARC's office of the
future, we will be surrounded by tiny computers embedded in virtually all
the familiar office tools. We will have intelligent notepads, badges,
clipboards, telephones, video screens, and even blackboards. (Oh, to be a
battery manufacturer in such a world!) They will all communicate with
each other over wireless links.

Based on radical increases in microprocessor performance, voice
recognition will become a pervasive factor in corporate computing as well
as personal communications.

These advances will have a profound effect on the workplace. Most
corporate employment growth since World War II has come in the service
sector, frequently in occupations involving answering information
requests via the telephone. Those jobs will be the first to be automated
by new corporate information systems. These systems will link large
databases with telephone-based information retrieval capabilities built
into applications as diverse as customer support, airline reservations,
and catalog shopping.

Xerox has also recently produced prototypes of flat-panel displays that
will finally blur the distinction between computer screens and printed
paper. Portable high-resolution monitors are virtually certain to replace
today's bulky screens. That will most likely mark the end of desktop
computing as we know it and accelerate the advent of small but extremely
powerful devices that combine personal communications and computing.

CHANGING THE EQUATION. It's inevitable that the PC as we know it will go
the way of the blacksmith and the dodo bird. Here's why:

In the 1960s, '70s, and '80s, the new computer technologies were almost
always deployed first in the most expensive supercomputers, which were
often used in esoteric military applications. Seymour Cray spent his
career designing exotic machines that were eagerly used by bomb designers
and the National Security Agency for cracking codes.

But consider the remarkable transformation that has taken place in the
1990s. The microprocessor used in the parallel supercomputer introduced
last year by Kendall Square Research was manufactured on the same
semiconductor production line that produces microprocessors for the Sharp
Wizard.

Increasingly in the future, the tools of advanced computing will be first
developed not by military systems designers or even workstation vendors.
They will come first from the makers of consumer electronics products.

One obvious example: television cable control boxes that must cost less
than $300 will have a gigaflop (a billion floating-point operations per
second) of computer power to enable the display of synthetic video images
before the personal computer on your desk does.

MISSING THE PARADIGM SHIFT. The other stark reality posed by Moore's and
Joy's laws is that the dominant makers of one generation's technology
have never been able to make the necessary changes to dominate the next
generation of computing.

IBM once believed that the total worldwide market demand for computers
would be 50. Ken Olsen, founder of Digital Equipment Corp., is legendary
for contemptuously dismissing the importance of personal computers.

The collapse of IBM stemmed from the computer giant's inability to
respond to the impact of the personal computer. In the late 1980s IBM's
highly profitable business making handmade proprietary mainframe systems
and selling them at monopoly prices began to crumble in the face of
inexpensive commodity hardware that quickly rivaled these behemoths at a
fraction of their price.

IBM's collapse has been hastened by its incapability to respond to
organizational changes now facing its best customers, the nation's
largest corporations. The information systems departments of these
companies at first resisted technological change, but since the mid-1980s
marketplace forces have driven companies to trim waves of employees. That
in turn has set off a wave of business re-engineering that has shifted
strategic emphasis toward developing new applications on networks of PCs
instead of mainframes and minicomputers. Finally, the falling cost and
rising power of microprocessor-based computers have reached a point where
it is proving possible to begin moving legacy applications off
traditional mainframes. That has created explosive growth in companies
such as Oracle Corp. and Sybase Inc., developers of relational database
products that cross mainframe, minicomputer, and workstation boundaries.

The impossibility of resisting each new wave of computing was brought
home to me several years ago when I visited an IBM assembly plant in East
Fishkill, N.Y. For several computing generations, the East Fishkill
factory has made the remarkably complex assemblies called Thermal
Conducting Modules that are at the heart of IBM's mainframes.

Making sandwich-size packages that are essentially intended to remove
heat from the custom circuits that mainframe processors are based on, the
factory seemed hopelessly outmoded to someone who was used to the way
computers were made in Silicon Valley.

I was stunned to learn that IBM's mainframe computers were possible only
because of remarkably complex miniature plumbing systems whose sole
purpose was to whisk heat away from superhot computer chips.

Years too late, the computer giant is finally reacting to its peril,
slashing its workforce and rebuilding its business around a powerful
microprocessor, the PowerPC -- something it should have done at least
five years ago.

Intel, which has been the largest beneficiary of the personal computing
explosion since having been handed its microprocessor franchise
accidentally by IBM, is also acutely aware of the dangers implicit in the
demise of the personal computer. Intel has a virtual monopoly in personal
computers. It's not clear at all that it will have the same vast
influence in the next generation of computing.

So the world's largest chip maker is now spending 10 percent of its
research and development budget each year trying to extend the life of
the IBM-compatible personal computer by developing new technologies that
it will freely license to computer makers. New data buses, video
compression technology, software-based digital signal processing for
audio applications, and computer networking for portable computers are
all technologies that Intel is hoping will restart growth in the personal
computer industry.

Yet a second technology may conspire to shorten the life of the personal
computer. Researchers are exploring optical computer networks that will
have data rates up to 25 trillion bits per second. Compared with today's
gigabit superhighways, terabit networks of the future are almost certain
to transform modern computing by fundamentally changing the relationship
between the costs of computing and communications.

No matter how fast the cost of computing falls, in the next decade the
cost of communications will drop even more quickly.

Danny Hillis, cofounder of Thinking Machines Inc., and others argue that
this trend, coupled with the advent of massively parallel supercomputers
based on tens of thousands of microprocessors, will lead to a
recentralization of computing in society -- much as today we all share
our electric power from a central power station.

EMPHASIS ON COMMUNICATIONS. Whether computing in the future is
centralized, distributed, or a combination of the two, innovation will
shift toward communications technologies during the 1990s. In both
computer networks and wireless communication technologies, new economic
forces rooted in the rivalry of the regional Bell operating companies and
the cable system operators are pushing the country rapidly toward the
construction of a national data superhighway.

The phenomenal growth of the Internet -- the international collection of
government, academic, research, and commercial networks -- is a harbinger
of a social and economic change that will be even more far reaching than
the advent of the personal computer.

In the short period between last summer and fall, more than 250,000 new
computers were attached to the Internet. More remarkably, in one month
last fall the data carried by the Internet's backbone increased by 2
terabytes -- more than the entire amount of data carried by the backbone
just a year ago.

Beyond high-speed fiber-optic networks, a range of new wireless data
technologies is emerging to carry digital data. Next year Motorola will
introduce its first personal communicator based on software now being
written by General Magic, an Apple Computer Inc. spinoff that is intent
on entirely reinventing the idea of personal computing around a hand-held
device that combines the functions of telephone and computer.

In August Apple introduced the Newton, a hand-held computer that
recognized handwriting. Three months later, Apple's AV series came out
with rudimentary speech recognition.

Both new technologies have substantial shortcomings. Newton's erratic
handwriting recognition has been chronicled in Doonesbury cartoons, and
the AV's voice recognition capabilities reportedly can be a potential
menace -- left on in a noisy room the machine is reportedly prone to
taking rash actions -- such as erasing files -- on its own.

But today's Newton, with its 10-MIPS processor and 640KB of memory, will
soon give way to hand-held machines with hundreds and then thousands of
MIPS of processing power and hundreds of megabytes of memory.

When the day arrives that we can carry the power of today's supercomputer
in our pocket, we will certainly have truly personal computers, but we
probably won't think of them as PCs at all.

Title:     Digital highway hits fork in road; legislation to rework
           Communications Act.
             (three bills proposed to update 1934 legislation)
Author:    Ubois, Jeff


Abstract:  Recently introduced legislation to supplant the obsolescent
           Federal Communications Act of 1934 may have a profound impact
           on the proposed 'information superhighway.' Three bills have
           emerged so far, and a fourth is likely to follow from the
           Clinton Administration sometime in 1994. The first bill, The
           National Communications Competition and Information
           Infrastructure Act of 1993, seeks to repeal cross-ownership
           laws passed in the Cable Act of 1984 to let Bell Companies
           into the Cable TV business, and also proposes opening local
           telephone markets to Cable TV providers. The
           Telecommunications Infrastructure Act of 1993 proposes opening
           local Cable TV and phone markets to competition, in addition
           to providing a level of universal service. The Antitrust and
           Communications Reform Act of 1993 seeks to lift restrictions
           on Bell companies that preclude them from providing
           long-distance service and building communications equipment.

Washington - Pending legislation that could rewrite the antiquated
Federal Communications Act of 1934 is generating intense interest here.
Whether Apple benefits from the bills is uncertain.

Unlike the personal computer industry, which is divided among hundreds of
companies and is intensely competitive, the telecommunications market is
dominated by a handful of players, and it is legislation and lawsuits -
rather than open competition -that typically decide the winners and
losers.

That's good and bad news for Apple, according to industry analysts.

"The recent moves to allow cable companies to carry phone service and the
[telephone companies] to carry video will be good for not only Apple but
for everyone [trying to bring] data of various types into the home," said
Pieter Hartsook, editor of The Hartsook Letter, an industry newsletter
based in Alameda, Calif. "Clearly, Apple has been interested for some
time and has shown prototypes, such as ezTV, that have a nice user
interface for surfing through 500 channels."

In addition, Hartsook said the wireless-data offerings planned by the
cable companies could be particularly useful for Newton and PowerBook
users.

But Apple will probably not gain any unique advantages from Capitol Hill
politicians, said Michael Yourshaw, a partner with Wiley, Rein and
Fielding, a communications law firm based here. "There will be a bigger
pie, and [Apple] will be fighting for their slice the way they always
have," he said.

So far, three bills have emerged as leading contenders to rework the
Communications Act, and it is likely the Clinton administration will
introduce its own measure early next year.

The key pending proposals are:

> The National Communications Competition and Information Infrastructure
Act of 1993 would open the local telephone service markets to competition
from cable TV providers and other independent phone companies. The bill,
introduced by Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., would also let Bell companies into
the cable TV business, repeal cross-ownership prohibitions in the Cable
Act of 1984 and establish a special board to develop plans for universal
service.

> The Antitrust and Communications Reform Act of 1993 would lift
restrictions on Bell companies that prohibit them from manufacturing
equipment and providing long-distance service. The bill was introduced by
Reps. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, and John Dingell, D-Mich.

> The Telecommunications Infrastructure Act of 1993 would open local
phone and cable TV markets to competition, as well as provide for some
level of universal service. Sens. John Danforth, D-Mo., and Daniel
Inouye, D-Hawaii, wrote the bill.

What the Clinton administration will offer is uncertain, but it is
expected to be similar to measures already introduced.

The Markey bill has gained strong support from several Washington,
D.C.-based public-interest groups, including the Electronic Frontier
Foundation.

"Markey's bill is the only bill that really takes steps to ensure that
people around the country have access to affordable digital service that
would connect them to this information infrastructure," said Daniel
Weitzner, EFF senior staff counsel. "These interconnection and access
rules need to really be looked at to make sure people with content and
people who want to get into the equipment market are able to do so."

Abstract:  Wave Systems Corp CEO Peter Sprague has created a possibly
           revolutionary technology for metering information usage in the
           age of the electronic information superhighway. Sprague was
           disgusted with enormous bills for usage of on-line services
           that he felt did not reflect the actual value he got from
           them, and if his company's technology is accepted by
           microcomputer manufacturers, Sprague and Wave could become the
           successful providers of an intelligent utility meter. The
           meter is based on a single-chip decryption solution with a
           microprocessor and non-volatile memory on board. The chip
           unscrambles encrypted information from a CD ROM drive or cable
           or wireless broadcast, then debits information usage against a
           prepaid account with a content provider. The company is beta
           testing the technology.

Peter Sprague was irked. As National Semiconductor's longtime chairman,
he found himself culling an on-line service for sales intelligence. And
his nine searches kept him connected long enough to ring up a hefty
$2,900 in access charges. The bill was so big that his own people hung up
on his request for a 10th search. But that wasn't all that annoyed him.
"I haven't gotten $2,900 worth of information," he remembers thinking.
"I've gotten $290 worth."

That was in late spring of 1988. Fast-forward to fall 1993. The world is
abuzz with talk of the torrent of data that will roar down the
"information highway." But nobody has figured out how to charge customers
for the information they really want, rather than making them pay for
every bit and byte that either pours out of a broadcast service or
resides on a CD ROM.

Nobody, that is, until Sprague.

He's the 54-year-old CEO and chairman of Wave Systems Corp., a 4-year-old
startup in New York now beta testing a new and possibly revolutionary PC
technology to meter information usage. Just how revolutionary? Put it
this way: If enough information providers and PC makers go along with
Sprague -- a big if -- the Wave system could become the information-age
equivalent of the ubiquitous household electric meter.

Think of it as an intelligent utility meter. At its heart is a
single-chip decryption solution with a microprocessor and non-volatile
memory on board. The chip resides in a PC, PDA, or even a PCMCIA card.
Its function? It unscrambles encrypted data from a CD ROM drive or a
cable or wireless broadcast. Even more, it debits information usage
against a prepaid account -- stored right there on the chip --
established with a content provider. Users simply replenish their
accounts by connecting through a modem t o a credit-card company. The
concept, in short, is this: Instead of metering usage at the head end, as
on-line services do, you track it at the point of consumption.

The big advantage? It frees users from mounting connect charges. But the
chip holds even more promise for providers. Assured that they'll be paid
for it, they could offer more data via CD ROM, cable, or even via
wireless broadcast.

"You could put the last five years of the Wall Street Journal and the
Financial Times in the [PC] box for nothing," Sprague claims. "Nobody is
going to put valuable information out on a cable or an RF [radio
frequency] line if they can't figure out what happened to it." Eventually
Sprague sees the Wave technology being used for everything from renting
video games to charging just for the "Doonesbury" comic strip, not the
entire electronically delivered morning paper.

Sounds futuristic. Sprague insists, however, some vertical markets are
ready for plucking. His first targets are accountants and law firms,
including several that are testing the Wave system. A lawyer might not be
willing to shell out $10,000 for a seldom-used CD ROM containing every
section and subsection of each state's legal code. "But he might pay you
on a per-use basis," says Richard Black, vice president at Personal
Library Software Inc., a Rockville, Md., provider of full-text retrieval
software tha t is co-marketing the Wave system.

Sprague hopes to do nothing less than create an all-lanes toll booth for
the information highway. Then again, grand ambitions are nothing new for
him. He's done everything from run for Congress against former New York
Mayor Ed Koch (he lost) to managing the largest cold-storage food plant
in the Middle East. By education, he's not a technologist; he studied
political science and economics. Yet he went on to obtain two technical
patents -- one for a projection television tube technology and the other
for co ming up with the concept of metering a scrambled broadcast data
stream, key to Wave's plans.

As National's chairman for the past 28 years, Sprague has kept a low
profile. But his background there gives Wave a decided advantage.
National is licensed to manufacture the chip. And its former president
and CEO, Charles Sporck, is among an impressive group of investors who
have ponied up more than $6 million since Wave's founding in 1988.
Others: Bob Laff, the co-chairman of distributor Merisel Inc., George
Conrades, a former IBM marketing executive, and George Gilder, the author
and futurist.

Wave's business plan is to break even on the encryption software and the
decryption/ metering chip. The real profits, Sprague says, will come from
royalties as customers access data. Wave wants to charge information
providers roughly 35 cents on each sales dollar. Sprague says the company
is willing to offer as much as half of its take to PC makers as an
incentive to install the chip on their machines and other computing
devices.

Even at that, though, nobody knows whether Sprague can convince PC
vendors to build in the Wave chip. Sprague says Hewlett-Packard Co. will
ship a Wave-equipped PC next summer. (HP declined comment.)

Sprague isn't just pioneering a new chip, though. He must also create an
infrastructure consisting of information providers and PC makers who will
use the Wave technology. What's more, Alan Reiter, the editor of the
Mobile Data Report, warns that Wave has yet to prove it won't make
information too hard or too expensive to retrieve.

As for content providers, Andrew Elston, the president of NewsNet Inc.,
an on-line information service in Bryn Mawr, Pa., says his company has
expressed an intent to work with Wave, but nothing more definitive than
that.

Nevertheless, he's hopeful. "It seems like a dream come true," he says of
the chip. "If Wave can pull this off -- and they seem to have the
connections to do it -- it could be a significant enhancement of the
whole environment for information retrieval."

Title:     Test run on the info superhighway.
             (Trends) (Brief Article)
Author:    Perenson, Melissa J.

Long before the information superhighway winds its way through every home
in America, a group of scientists and researchers are gearing up for a
test run to demonstrate distributed computing over a high-speed network.
In the process, the companies building the National Information
Infrastructure Testbed (NIIT) hope to turn theory into commercial reality
and work through the logistical quagmires that are bound to surface.

Slated to go on-line in November 1993, the Earth Data System testbed is
the first in a series of NIIT experiments. It brings together scientists
and policymakers from across the country who are involved in ecological
issues. The next one, scheduled for 1994, will tackle health care
administration.

Earth Data Systems connects nine sites across in the U.S. into a
high-speed network serving 800 gigabytes of video, audio, data, and text.
Ethernet or FDDI workstations use TCP/IP protocol to communicate with
other sites across the long-distance network's frame relay or
asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switches. The high-bandwidth network
runs at 45 megabits per second for fiber optic ATM and 1.5 Mbps for
frame-relay running over T1 circuits.

The network is the brainchild of a consortium, including AT&T, Department
of Energy, Digital Equipment Corp., Ellery Systems, Hewlett-Packard,
Sandia National Labs, Smithosonian Astrophysical Observatory, and Sprint.
"The purpose of NIIT is to work out a variety of issues around providing
a national information structure, ranging from the technology of
interconnection to the business issues of providing the service and the
legislative issues regulating this service," says Robert Bismuth of
Digital.

The benefits of EDS will be tremendous. Users of the multimedia workgroup
application can access information seamlessly, regardless of where that
information is geographically located. Access is limited to Unix
workstations, though universal access via the Internet is planned.
Meanwhile, the NIIT's findings from this dry run will be shared with
lawmakers now pondering policies for the future information highway.

Title:     Inside track.
Author:    Dvorak, John C.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full Text:

There's a lot of talk in the industry about IBM's new "clean room"
project to create its own version of the 486 microcode. The purported
goal is to add silicon to the PowerPC 601 chip to allow IBM's
next-generation PC the ability to run both native x86 apps and PowerPC
apps.

I've always found this project a bit peculiar, since the 601 is supposed
to be the perfect chip for emulation, and you'd think that would be a
cheaper way to go. Well, some people now believe that IBM is fashioning a
big misinformation campaign--that the company is indeed
reverse-engineering the 486, but that this project has nothing to do with
the PowerPC. Instead, IBM intends to clone the 486 and the Pentium as
well so it can produce and sell chips against Intel (and AMD, and Cyrix,
and TI). This is where the money is.

Currently, IBM has a license to make Intel chips but is restricted from
selling them, except for use in its own systems or on IBM motherboards.
It can't sell raw chips under the license. While IBM has suddenly become
a leader in motherboard manufacturing with a line of motherboards
containing IBM's 486, it wants to sell bulk processors--especially the
clock-tripled chips that Intel seems reluctant to produce. Some observers
watching the current aggressiveness of IBM are calling it the "wounded
bear syndrome." That is, IBM sees everyone as the enemy and intends to be
in all markets.

Meanwhile, Intel is still struggling internally with the Pentium. The
company needs to get the Pentium into the market, but it's essentially
losing money on each chip it makes. Intel's not making as much money as
it would make if the time and resources were instead spent on 486
production. The word in the valley is that the company loses seven 486s
when it makes one Pentium. This is a function of yield and die-size.
Since the 486DX2/66 sells for about $400 and the Pentium sells for about
$950, you can see why certain Intel managers--whose compensations are
adjusted as profits go up and down--are squawking.

Dvorak's Quick Analysis: In fact, Intel is doing the right thing by
forcing the Pentium out of the door. Intel is a technology leader, and
its leadership is paramount to continued success. It has to push the
newest stuff at the expense of a cash cow. No bull!

Trends You Can Count On: As you know, I've been following the upcoming
bloodbath in hi-res monitors. Every monitor company is jockeying for the
dominant slot by offering new features. Just as multisync, multiscan
monitors dominated the late 1980s, look for something called Continuous
Scan to dominate the rest of this decade. Sony will probably be first
with one as it tries to wrestle the number-one spot away from NEC, which
has been coasting with its FG series for a couple of years.

Internet Humor Dept.: Anyone with an Internet connection knows it's good
for three things: (1) cheap e-mail, (2) rapid propagation of bogus
rumors, (3) nerdy urban folklore (a.k.a. jokes and humorous observations
passed from person to person). Here's the latest story passed around the
net:

True story, happened yesterday. Paul Mockapetrus was at Bellcore watching
a demonstration of Tennenhouse's Vu-net connected to a Sunshine switch
and the Aurora network. The Vu-net physical hardware is roughly three
large PC boards sitting on a table with wires hanging all over the place.
The Sunshine switch was sitting next to it, with even more wires hanging
out.

Paul M (standing over Vu-net and peering at it): "Sure doesn't look like
an information superhighway to me."

Bruce Davie: "Do you want me to paint a yellow stripe down the middle?"

I guess you had to be there.

The MCI Mail Test Dept.: Although customer service denied that MCI has a
14.4-kilobit-per-second link, the company's been testing it for a few
months. Set your modem to 38,400 bits per second and call the old MCI
2,400-bps modem line at 800-456-6245 and bingo! You're connected at
V.32bis (14.4 kilobits per second) and V.42bis. Great speed for those
Zmodem downloads. I suppose MCI isn't talking about it since it seems to
run only about 20 percent faster than the 9,600-bps link. If you're into
speed, then also check CompuServe for the new 14.4-Kbps phone numbers.
Gee, just in time for V.FAST.

Genuinely Interesting Gizmo Dept.: It's called the MotorMouse, a
switchable two- or three-button mouse in the shape of a Lamborghini or
Corvette. You push down on the hood to get the button action. The mouse
comes in red, white, and yellow. The red Corvette looks great! List price
is $65.99, but there's an introductory offer at $59.95. This is a perfect
gift for the person who has everything. The company can be reached by
calling 604-681-6062, or writing MotorMouse at 126 Garden Ave., North
Vancouver, BC V7P 3H2 or P.O. Box 9754, 3873 Airport Way, Bellingham, WA
98227-9754.

THE SUPERHIGHWAY ON A BEATEN TRACK

Until now, the electronic superhighway has existed only in the ether. But
with the November debut of the Earth Data System (EDS), the National
Information Infrastructure became a beaten track.

The EDS is the first application of the National Information
Infrastructure Testbed (NIIT), a high-speed network that will link nine
sites across the United States using ATM, frame relay, and FDDI.
Representatives from U.S. industry, academia, and government lead the
NIIT consortium.

"We will run lab-tested applications in a real-world environment to see
if we meet the customer needs," says Dr. John Gibbons, assistant to the
president for Science and Technology and director of the Office of
Science and Technology policy based in Washington, D.C.

The EDS is a suite of environmental research and analysis applications.
Researchers in different locations will use these distributed
applications to share the environmental data and image files across an
ATM network. Oregon State University, University of New Hampshire, and
University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB) are working on the first
application in the EDS suite: a deforestation monitoring program.
Researchers at these sites and around the country will use the NIIT to
share gigabytes of landsat and other satellite imagery and data to
analyze the level of deforestation in a particular area, for example.

"One of the problems is how the scientists get at that information. How
do they store it? Each image can be hundreds of megabytes to a gigabyte.
Once the scientists have the information, they have different models and
analyses they want to run it through. Then how do they collaborate with
other researchers in the United States and throughout the world?" asks
Jeff Jordan, vice president at Ellery Systems (Boulder, CO). Ellery Open
Systems software provides the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE)
component of the deforestation application.

The primary NIIT sites--University of New Hampshire, Oregon State, Sandia
National Laboratories, and Hewlett-Packard--will interconnect through
Sprint's ATM network at the DS-3 speed of 45Mbps. The secondary
sites--UCSB and University of California at Berkeley--will access the EDS
through frame relay services. Unlike the lower-speed Internet, the NIIT
provides a venue to test distributed applications on a high-speed, ATM
road.

NIIT members argue that the NII is essential to the U.S. economy. "The
quality of information determines how well businesses can compete in a
global market," says Lew Platt, president and CEO of Hewlett-Packard. "We
must stimulate the development of key technologies. You can develop them
in the isolation of a research lab, or you can do it in the NIIT where
you can create a market pull."

Members of the NIIT include AT&T, Ellery Systems, Essential
Communications, Hewlett-Packard, Network Systems, Oregon State
University, Sandia National Labs, Smithsonian Atrophysical Observatory,
Sprint, SynOptics, and University of New Hampshire. A healthcare
application is planned for 1994.

Title:     America gets wired.
             (plans for National Information Infrastructure) (News
             Monitor) (Brief Article)
Author:    Ross, Randy

Full Text:

The administration's plans for a data superhighway are emerging in the
form of several pieces of legislation and a National Information
Infrastructure (NII) blueprint and task force. Developed by Vice
President Al Gore, the longtime patron saint of the Internet computer
network, the NII blueprint drew fire for favoring commercial interests.
In response, a task force was convened to plan a data superhighway that
will benefit the public interest and create jobs.

In Congress, a number of bills aim to develop aspects of the "information
society." The House recently passed and sent to the Senate the National
Information Infrastructure Act of 1993, which promotes remote teaching,
library access, health care, and online government access. The Senate is
considering a similar bill of its own-the National Competitiveness Act of
1993. Other bills seek to promote competition in telecommunications and
provide access to government databases.
