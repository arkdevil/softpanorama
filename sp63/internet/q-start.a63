As a holiday gift to Boston Globe readers who are interested in "hopping 
on the Internet and checking it out" but may not know where to start, 
the editor of the Globe's VOXBOX section asked me to put together a 
quick "how to do it, where to start, whom to call" piece that also 
suggests things to do which may also be news to existing "Internauts." 

On the one hand, this -- like many Internet-related questions -- doesn't 
have an answer that's short, simple, helpful and still short.  

Especially short.  When I tackled this question in the Internet book I 
wrote, _The Internet Guide for New Users_ (McGraw-Hill, 1993), Chapter 
2: "The Internet on a Dollar A Day: How to Get a User Account and Plug 
In" ran forty book pages, and the whole book's 600+ pages. 

On the other hand, as you'll see, it IS possible to give a short yet 
useful answer -- by narrowing the question down sufficiently, and not 
attempting to give an answer to comprehensive as to overwhelm the reader 
with more information and choices than they handle. 

This article therefore:

o Is targetted especially at people in the Boston Globe's primary 
  circulation areas -- the greater Boston area and the rest of 
  Massachusetts, and portions of New Hampshire and Rhode Island. 

o Assumes you'll get a "net buddy" to help you with the less familiar 
  parts

o Assumes you'll have access to one or more Internet "navigators" --
  in particular, Gopher -- which will make your efforts much easier.


     ------------------------------------------------------------------
Q T  Gopher, a popular Internet "navigation and browsing tool," is very 
U I  easy to use; you should be able to master its basics within 
I P  minutes.  Use UP/DOWN arrow keys to change selections; RIGHT-arrow 
C S  or <RETURN> to choose a menu item; LEFT-arrow to go back up a menu 
K !  level.  "h" will give you more information on how to use Gopher. 
     ------------------------------------------------------------------


This article talks about how to access the Internet for individuals, at 
home or the office, by obtaining an individual account, using a personal 
computer and modem, and connecting via your telephone.  (It's also 
possible to connect your office computers and networks up directly to 
the Internet, but that's outside the scope of this piece.) 

If you're serious about being an Internet user for personal or 
professional activities, you'll probably want to invest some time and 
money getting up to speed -- buy one or more Internet books (I wrote one 
-- and there are numerous others), take a course from the Boston 
Computer Society or elsewhere, etc.  

But is is possible for even a complete newcomer who's never taken 
keyboard or mouse in hand to get onto the Internet and begin exploring 
its virtual nooks and cyber-byways.  

Once on, you can send e-mail to the Boston Globe, read and follow 
topical discussions, retrieve documents and programs, play multi-user 
games, and do all sorts of other nifty stuff!  As you'll see in the 
second half of this article, there's no shortage of things you can do 
on/with the Internet that are easy yet immediately rewarding.  You don't 
have to become a heavy-duty computer expert! 


PRACTICING WHAT WE PREACH: DERN IN GOPHERSPACE 

As you may have noticed, depending on how this version of my article 
gets to you, I'm using the Internet to make this (and other) Internet 
information available, primarily through Gopher and e-mail servers run 
by The Internet Company (internet.com).  I've also arranged to have 
current copies or pointers to other key information "nearby," so that, 
once you've obtained at least some Internet access, you can obtain the 
information I'm referring to without having to hunt around for it. 

For example, I've put up Peter Kaminski's "PDIAL" list of organizations 
offering Internet accounts for individuals, Scott Yanoff's Special 
Internet Connections list of popular Internet services, and information 
on major Internet account providers for the New England area. 

As of January 1994, you can find this article, Gopher menu(s) that 
"gophermate" (automate via Gopher) many of the things in here, and other 
info by gophering to internet.com; that is, at a system prompt, by 
typing:

    gopher internet.com 

Look for a top-level menu item with my name in it; the current label as 
of January 1994 is "Dern's Internet Info, News and Views".  (Email based 
access is still in the works.)


A FEW CAUTIONARY WORDS

One quick caution: The "things to do" in this article primarily involve 
finding and retrieving information from the Internet, rather than 
interacting with other people or putting your own thoughts and 
information onto the Internet. 

As a newcomer (a.k.a. "newbie"), it is best to start by being a 
background participant -- a "lurker."  There's nothing wrong with this 
-- just because you read the Globe every day doesn't mean you have to 
write a Letter to the Editor daily. 

The Internet is used by a multitude of communities around the country 
and world -- tens of millions of people, encompassing many different 
cultures, plus the Internet and on-line world has a very strong culture 
of its own.  It's easy to waste resources or annoy lots of people 
deliberately and even by accident.  

If you plan to be a long-time resident of cyberspace, plan to learn and 
follow its rules and guidelines.  Here's the short version:

o Remember that anything you do or say in the Internet's "public places" 
  may be read by your family, friends, and boss -- don't say anything you 
  aren't "willing to see on the front page of tomorrow's Boston Globe." 

o Don't post a message to a mailing list or Usenet Newsgroup until 
  you've been reading it for AT LEAST two weeks.  This will help you
  avoid many common beginner errors (you'll get to watch other people 
  make them, and see what response they get).

OK, buckle up your virtual seat belt and let's go!  In the first half, 
let's see how to get access to the Internet, then in the second half 
we'll explore some interesting, easy-to-use parts of the Internet. 


STEP 1: Get Yourself a "Net Buddy" (The "Net Buddy System") 

For your initial forays into the Internet, your best resource is a "net 
buddy" -- someone (or several people) who's already using the Internet 
and who's willing to help you muddle through the early stages of gaining 
access and learning to "work the controls."  Ask around.  

If you can't find an Internet-familiar friend, try for someone who's 
familiar with CompuServe, MCI Mail, Prodigy or a BBS (Bulletin Board 
System) -- they should be able to help you with the "getting connected" 
parts if nothing else. 

Your "net buddy" may be a co-worker, a friend, the Boston Computer 
Society's Internet SIG (Special Interest Group)... you're looking for a 
resource that can help you with answers and tips especially during those 
first sessions when you may not be able to identify and articulate your 
real problems and questions.  

Suggestions: If possible, pick someone who's not a long-distance call 
away; even better, someone who can sit next to you for at least your 
first one or two sessions. 

The odds are good that within a startlingly short time you'll be ready 
to be someone else's "net buddy." 


STEP 2: Get Computer, Modem, and Phone.

If you don't already have the necessary equipment to "go on-line," it's 
time to buy, rent or borrow it.  (You're bound to know one or more 
people who can help you do this.)  

You don't need fancy or expensive equipment; someone's obsolete computer 
that they feel is completely worthless may be adequate, or you may find 
a used machine for $100 or less! 

You'll need a COMPUTER -- almost any personal computer will do, such as 
a PC-compatible running DOS or Windows, any Apple computer, Amiga, etc. 
-- as long as it can run a COMMUNICATIONS PROGRAM, such as ProComm, 
MicroPhone, and support a MODEM. 

In fact, you'll also need a communications program.  Look for one that 
supports "VT100 terminal emulation."  (Most do.)  Inexpensive and free 
communications programs are readily available.  You also may already 
have one --for example, Microsoft Windows and many of today's computer 
systems include this.  Most modems also include a free comm program, 
although you may decide you want a different one.  

You'll need to know how to turn this program on, set it so it talks to 
the appropriate COMMUNICATIONS PORT (e.g., COMM1, COMM2) on your 
computer, how to load in telephone numbers and a few pieces of 
information for each.  

In particular, you'll want to learn how to set SPEED (usually in bits 
per second or baud), # of DATA BITS, STOP BIT, and PARITY BIT.  For 
example: ST&D World, 617-730-WRLD, 9600 bps, 8 bits data, Stop 1, Parity 
None.  

At some point, you'll probably also want to learn how to "capture" text 
from your screen to a file on your computer's hard drive, and how to 
upload/download files between your computer and your Internet account.  
(It's not hard to do, but how to do it with your computer isn't always 
obvious.) 

You'll need a MODEM.  Even a 1,200 or 2400 baud modem can suffice; these 
are available for as little as $40 these days.  However, if you're 
serious about being online, you'll want one that can handle speeds of 
9,600 or even 14,400 bits per second (bps); otherwise things may appear 
slowwww.  You can get a modem like this for under $200. 

You'll also need a phone line you can use, and the appropriate wires to 
connect up.  (If you have Call-Waiting service, remember to first dial 
*70 before the actual phone number; this disables (turns off) Call-
Waiting until you hang up again.) 

You may find yourself instantly successful at using the Internet, 
especially if you've used a BBS or on-line service before.  If you 
haven't, be ready to spend a few hours getting the hang of simply 
connecting and learning how to enter commands to your account.  It's not 
that expensive -- not counting the cost of phone message units, 
connecting should only be costing you one to three dollars per hour.  
And, as noted elsewhere, many services give you the first hour or 
several hours free! 


STEP 3: Get an "Internet Account."

The easiest, cheapest, quickest way to gain access to the Internet is to 
get an account with an online service or BBS that offers "Internet 
access." 

As part of your account, you'll get a "net ID" includes your "user-
name," such as "john.smith" plus a "site name" like "world.std.com" -- 
these get put together like so "john.smith@world.std.com" to form your 
INTERNET E-MAIL ADDRESS.  You'll also get a password, which you should 
write down someplace safe (not under your keyboard!) and be sure to 
remember. 

The greater Boston area is blessed with many Internet account providers.  
Most charge around $1-$3/hour.  Free trial periods of one to five hours 
are common.  There are also many offering no-charge or donation access, 
and organization-based services available for free to their members -- 
one downside may be frequent busy signals or poorer support for users. 
 
The section "Get Your Starter Internet Access Here" at the end of this 
article offers contact info for some of the leading Boston-area Internet 
access providers.  (Be sure to inquire about additional modem numbers in 
your local calling area.)  If you've got Gopher access, you can also 
look for the Internet Account Providers area I've set up in the "Dern's 
Internet Info, News and Views" gopherspace at internet.com. 


Base your choice on factors such as: 

o being within your local phone calling area (to keep your phone 
  bill down) 

o User interface and local on-line help.  Don't expect a Graphic User 
  Interface like AOL or Prodigy here; you'll get simple menuing systems, 
  or perhaps just a Unix prompt (analogous to the DOS "C:>" prompt.  
  Many new users like DELPHI's enhanced menus. 

If you're already familiar with Unix, you may prefer to go straight to 
World.  In any case, standard Internet facilities like Gopher quickly 
present you with a more informative, easy to use window to the Internet. 

All full-service Internet access providers should offer comparable sets 
of service: electronic mail, access to the Usenet "bulletin board" 
Newsgroups, the ability to retrieve and download files, real-time 
Internet "Chat," navigators like Gopher and WorldWideWeb, etc. 

If you already have an account on an online service like America OnLine, 
CompuServe, GEnie, or Prodigy, you have limited access to the Internet 
via electronic mail; however, this is like seeing Star Wars with a paper 
bag over your head - far from the real experience. 

Don't worry too much about "making the right choice."  Once you're "on 
the net" you can easily locate lists and information of other providers; 
changing or getting another account is very easy.  You'll learn how in 
the second half.  (But don't make up new business cards with your "net 
address" until you're certain.)  


STEP 4: Log in and hop on.

Now that you've got the equipment and an account, it's time to 
stick a toe into cyberspace.  
    
You'll do this by typing some short commands as given below, or 
possibly using your mouse to select menu items or icons.  Here's 
a few quick tips:

o <RETURN> means the key labelled <RETURN> or <ENTER> on your keyboard.  
  <CONTROL-character>, also often given as ^char, means holding down the 
  <CONTROL> key and the indicated character simultaneously, such 
  <CONTROL-C> (a.k.a. CTRL-C or ^C), <CONTROL-D>, etc.  

o Other keys you're likely to use include "?" or "h" for on-line help, 
  <SPACE> (the 'space' bar'), and the four "arrow-keys" (up, down, right 
  and left). 

o Unlike DOS, many things in the Internet are "case sensitive" -- for 
  example, README, ReadMe, and readme would be the names of three 
  different files.  "Punctuation" counts -- pay attention to spaces 
  (don't add or leave them out), etc. 

o :-) is a "smiley-face" and means "just kidding" or "meant humorously.  
  Tilt your head to the left and look at it again -- see the "smile"? 

o "FAQ" refers to a compilation of Frequently-Asked Questions, and their 
  answers.  There's one or more FAQ documents for most major Internet 
  services and activities, and for most Usenet Newsgroups.  When in 
  doubt, before asking someone, find and read the appropriate FAQ. 

o If all else fails, hang up the phone and a) start again or b) contact 
  your Net Buddy for help. 


Start by dialing up.  (You may want your Net Buddy here for the first 
try.) 

1. Power up your computer and modem 
2. Make sure the modem is connected to the phone line 
3. Select your communications program 
4. Select the Internet entry to be dialed.  You'll hear some whistling 
   and windy sounds; after a few seconds, you should see text on your 
   screen.  (If the sound stops but no text appears, try hitting the 
   <RETURN> key a few times.) 
5. When you see something like "login:" or "user-ID:", type your 
   username followed by the <RETURN> key. 
6. When you see something like "Password:" type in your password 
   followed by the <RETURN> key.  (You won't see your password on the 
   screen when you type it.  This is a security feature.) 
7. If you see a prompt like "Terminal?" or (term=vt100)?, enter 
   <RETURN>; if you are asked for a terminal type, type 
   "vt100 <RETURN>".  Get your net buddy to help you through this stuff. 

Eventually you'll get a "system prompt," such as "world%" or simply "%" 
or "$". 
 

HEIGH HO, TO CYBERSPACE WE GO

You've now learned how to get up and running on the Internet -- find a 
"net buddy" to help you cut through the fog, set up a PC and modem, get 
an Internet user account and log in.  At this point, you are hopefully 
able to access the Internet, and can start giving commands that let you 
use and explore the Internet.  (If not, keep reading anyway to get a 
sense of what you can do "once you get there.")

Once you're on the Internet, there are a thousand and one things you can 
do -- and many of them are interesting.  Now that you're up and running 
on the Internet, here's a few easy Internet activities you can do, 
ranging from holiday-related and contacting the Boston Globe to browsing 
for books and getting an I-Ching reading.  Enjoy! 


* TRY THIS: Check Out Smileys and Other Internet Humor

Read about Smileys and other Internet humor (including one of my own 
holiday humor essays) in the "Humor" sub-section of World's "Information 
about the World" Gopher section. For more smileys, browse the O'Reilly & 
Company Gopher 

    gopher ora.com <RETURN>


* TRY THIS: Browse information from the United States Senate

Aldo Casteneda (aldo@world.std.com) reports, "As of the 15th of December 
1993, you can get direct access to the United States Senate FTP server. 
Although Senator Kennedy from the great state of Massachussetts is the 
only member to go online at this point, many more members will be doing 
so soon." 

World has also set up a Gopher link to this information, in its 
"Government Information" section, in the "FTP access to Senate.Gov" 
subtopic; if you're not starting from World, first enter 

    gopher world.std.com <RETURN>

You can also retrieve information via the Internet's FTP (File Transfer 
Program) utility, by entering 

   ftp ftp.senate.gov <RETURN>

Enter either "anonymous" or "ftp" as the login user-name and give your 
Internet ID (e.g., yourname@world.std.com) as the password; enter 
"?<ENTER>" the "?" command to get a list of FTP commands. 

A niftier, much easier to use version of FTP called NcFTP is available 
on World and some other sites; simply enter 

    ncftp<ENTER>


* TRY THIS: Browse book and magazine tables of contents and excerpts on 
  the Electronic Newsstand. 

The Electronic Newsstand, a joint project of The Internet Company 
(Cambridge MA) and The New Republic (Washington, DC) offer free access 
to information about leading magazines like the New Yorker, other media 
such as the Discovery Channel, plus my and a Mac-specific Internet book.  
Simply enter 

  gopher enews.com <RETURN>


* TRY THIS: Get an I-Ching reading and take a hypertext cruise of the 
  Internet's information resources on the WorldWideWeb. 

The WorldWideWeb (WWW) provides a subject/cross-reference way to "cruise 
the Internet."  Mosaic, the GUI-based WWW front end you may have read 
about recently, requires a direct (TCP/IP) connection to the Internet, 
and graphics capability -- but you can access the ASCII text parts of 
"webspace" from your dial-up account.  Try entering: 

    www<RETURN>

or else select "WorldWideWeb" from a Gopher or other menu of Internet 
services. 


* TRY THIS:  Send e-mail to the Boston Globe

Many various departments of the Boston Globe now accept messages 
via e-mail.  Here's a partial list of Globe e-mail contacts:

  circulation@globe.com
       circulation requests/problems, vacation stops, subscription info
  classified@globe.com
       information about placing a classified ad
  letter@globe.com
       letters to the editor (please include full name and address)
  ask@globe.com
       submissions to "Ask The Globe"
  voxbox@globe.com
       submissions to the Living section's "Voxbox" column
  ombud@globe.com
       letters to the Globe Ombudsman
  list@globe.com
       event listings for Thursday's Calendar section
  howwhy@globe.com
       Health and Science section
  ciweek@globe.com
       City Weekly section
  arts@globe.com
       arts editor

When sending e-mail to the Globe, be sure to include your full name, 
address and phone number (and whether or not it's OK to include them if 
running your message in the paper). 


* TRY THIS: Get the FAQs

FAQs -- Frequently Asked Questions and their Answers documents -- for 
most aspects of the Internet and Usenet are readily available for 
reading and retrieval from a number of Internet sources, including: 

o in the Usenet news.answers Newsgroup; also, each Newsgroup's FAQ can 
  usually be found in that Newsgroup 

o from many Gopher menus 

o by anonymous-FTP file transfer from the site  rtfm.mit.edu enter  "ftp 
  rtfm.mit.edu <RETURN>"  (or "ncftp" if it's available) 

Ask your Net Buddy for help here.



* TRY THIS: Check out the discussions of your favorite movies and TV 
  series, games, hobbies, etc. 

The Usenet is the Internet-based global "BBS" -- bulletin board system -
- of over five thousand topical discussion areas, or Newsgroups.  Many 
are serious technical and business forums, but there are also hundreds 
for hobby, social and personal interests.  Many Internet sites also 
carry popular newspaper columnists like Mike Royko, Ms. Manners and Dave 
Barry. 

You access Usenet Newsgroups via a "newsreader" program.  Popular ones 
on dial-up Internet sites include "trn" "nn" and "tin"; like Gopher, you 
can do most basic selection and reading activities with little more than 
the <SPACE>, <RETURN>, and arrow keys, plus "?" or "h" for online help. 

Like joining any new "club," it's strongly recommended you start by 
READING the postings in a given Usenet group for at least two weeks 
before attempting to pose a question or contribute an answer.  

Get your "net buddy" to identify and select five or ten Newsgroups of 
possible interest, and to help you set things up so you can read them.  
If you know the name of a Newsgroup you want to read, you can also 
access it by giving the name of your newsreader and the newsgroup, e.g. 

    trn news.announce.newusers <RETURN>


* TRY THIS: Find recipes and other information with keyword searches 

The Internet's WAIS (Wide Area Information Server) facility lets you do 
keyword searches through collections of text information such as recipe 
collections, the online file of Hacker's jargon, and hundreds of other 
serious and light-heartded sources. 

If you can't access WAIS through an entry in a Gopher or other menu 
(e.g., one like "Gopher and other Internet servers"), enter 

    telnet quake.think.com <RETURN>

and enter "swais" in response to the "login" prompt.  Try giving 
"recipes" or "jargon" as a starting keyword to select a WAIS database; 
use the <SPACE>, <ENTER>, arrow, and "?" keys to do basic navigation. 


* TRY THIS: Get Wired

Browse partial back issue text of Wired magazine -- select Wired 
magazine from World's "Periodicals, Magazines, and Journals/" Gopher 
menu; other Internet users can access the information by entering 

    gopher wired.com <RETURN>


* TRY THIS: Membership and Professional Organizations

Get information about the Boston Computer Society, Electronic Frontier 
Foundation, Online Career, the BMUG Macintosh User Group and other 
organizations.  

World users simply enter 

    gopher<RETURN> 

Other Internet users enter

    gopher world.std.com<RETURN>

and then Select the "Membership and Professional Associations/" 
entry in the World's top-level Gopher menu -- or look around your 
own site's Gopher menus.



* TRY THIS: Get More Information About the Internet

Browse and retrieve online information about the Internet in the 
Information Services area of the InterNIC (NSFnet Internet Network 
Information Center) Gopher by entering: 

  gopher internic.net <RETURN>

For a long (1,700+ lines!) list of companies offering dial-up access to 
the Internet, get a copy of Peter Kaminski's PDIAL List (Public Dial-up 
Internet Access List).  Simply send an email message to: 

  info-deli-server@netcom.com

with "send PDIAL" in the message header or body; a program at the 
other end will automatically send you back a copy by e-mail. 
This list is also periodically made available to Usenet 
Newsgroups including alt.internet.services. 


* TRY THIS:  The End -- Or the Beginning 

As you can probably see, the Internet is simultaneously a vast 
jumble of disorganized data and random stuff, an incomparable 
resource, and a marvelous source of entertainment.  The trick is 
to learn how to "work the dashboard" and to find the resources, 
services and people of interest to you!


A FEW FINAL TIPS...

Here's a few quick tips:

o Good Usenet Newsgroups for general Internet information, q&a, and 
  announcements include: 

news.announce.important  (almost no messages)
news.announce.newusers   (read this until it looks familiar)
news.newusers.questions  (see if your question has been asked and
bit.listserv.help-net       answered in one of these)
news.answers             (ALL the Usenet FAQs are here)
alt.internet.services    (user-oriented announcements, questions
biz.comp.services           and discussions)
alt.online-service       (Re AOL, GEnie, Prodigy, WELL, etc.)
alt.bbs.internet         (Internet aspects of BBSs)
wstd.general, wstd.help  (for users on World)

o For a good summary list of Internet Services, see Scott Yanoff's 
  Special Internet Connections list -- see my gopher area in 
  internet.com, check the Usenet alt.internet.services Newsgroup, or 
  Gopher to csd4.csd.uwm.edu, in the Remote Information Servers menu. 

o Ask for "good Gopher sites to start from," try using the WorldWideWeb; 
  also try other Internet navigators such as "hytelnet".

SIDEBAR: 1993 Holiday Stuff on the Internet

The Internet community periodically puts together seasonal/topical 
information and resource collections; here's some from the December 1993 
holiday season. 

[ These were at the beginning when this originally ran in the Boston 
Globe; since the holidays have passed (it's Groundhog Day as I edit this 
to be put on-line), I'm moving them down here, but leaving them in for 
general interest. - DPD ]

* TRY THIS: Why not start by checking out Holiday information?

Delphi has created a Holiday Gopher menu that gathers together holiday-
related information from Delphi and dozens of Internet sites around the 
globe.  

The Delphi Holiday Gopher includes holiday-related recipes, books, 
stories, songs, music, graphics, holiday items, and gift ideas, plus 
road condition and weather report/forecast information.  (FYI, according 
to Delphi, the information has all been checked before including it; 
everything is "G" rated and suitable for the entire family.) 

From Delphi, enter

    GO ENT HOLIDAY <RETURN>

(You'll also find some options available to Delphi users only, including 
Delphi's own "Send a Letter to Santa.") 

From World, MV, IDS or other Internet sites, enter 

    gopher delphi.com <RETURN>


* TRY THIS: SEND E-MAIL TO SANTA

You can send electronic mail to Santa Claus and his helpers, to any of 
the following addresses: 

  santa@csgi.com
  santa.claus@genie.genis.com
  elves@north.pole.org

Popular e-mail programs include "pine" and "elm"; also try "mail"; for 
example 

    pine elves@north.pole.org <RETURN>

Delphi also has a "Send a Letter to Santa" menu item in its Holiday 
section. 


* TRY THIS: CHECK ON CYGNUS' CHRISTMAS TREE

Cygnus Support in Mountain View, California has set up its Christmas 
Tree so its lights and bells can be turned on and off by using Internet 
network management tools.  While Cygnus won't let you control their tree 
(you're too far away to see it anyway :-), you can check the status of 
the lights, bubble lights and bells of Cygnus' tree with this command: 

  finger xmastree.@cygnus.com <RETURN>
