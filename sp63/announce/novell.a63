Novell to acquire Wordperfect corporation and purchase Borland's Quattro
Pro spreadsheet business

Entering Application Marketplace to Lead in Next Generation Network
Applications

Provo, UT. -- March 21, 1994 -- Novell, Inc. (NASDAQ:NOVL) and
WordPerfect Corporation today signed a definitive merger agreement that
provides for the acquisition of WordPerfect by Novell, creating one of
the largest software companies in the world.  Under the terms of the
agreement, shares of  WordPerfect common stock and stock options will be
exchanged for  approximately 59 million shares of Novell common stock
and options.  After the merger, on a fully diluted basis, the new shares
will represent approximately 15 percent of Novell's shares.  The
transaction is expected to be non-dilutive to Novell earnings.  The
boards of directors of Novell and WordPerfect have approved the
definitive agreement, but the merger is subject to regulatory approvals
and other conditions to closing.

Novell further announced today the signing of an agreement with Borland
International Inc. to purchase its Quattro Pro spreadsheet business for
approximately $145 million.  This purchase is also subject to regulatory
approvals and other conditions to closing.  It is anticipated that both
transactions will close in Novell's third fiscal quarter 1994.

"Building from what we already do as the networking company, Novell
intends to provide leadership in redefining the applications business by
helping drive the growing market transition to network applications,"
said Raymond J. Noorda president and chief executive officer of Novell.
"The era of standalone personal computing is evolving into group
collaboration that connects individuals, groups and companies.  Novell's
objective is to accelerate this market transition by offering new
generations of network applications with the flexibility and freedom of
open interfaces and published standards."

"The merger will further strengthen Novell financially.  WordPerfect
will increase Novell's revenue, add to Novell's already strong balance
sheet and expand Novell's earnings potential," added Noorda.

"This combination positions WordPerfect to be central to the next
generation of applications," said Ad Rietveld, president and chief
executive officer of WordPerfect Corporation.  "We believe that
customers will look back on the mid-90s as marking a renaissance in the
information systems industry.  We are helping Novell create a software
powerhouse to deliver standalone, software suites, groupware and network
applications that define new capabilities for information systems."

WordPerfect will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Novell and form the
core of a new application software product group within Novell.  The new
business unit will be headed by Ad Rietveld who also joins Novell's
office of the president.  As part of the merger agreement, Novell will
expand its board of directors by adding two new members appointed by the
shareholders of WordPerfect.

Philippe Kahn, chairman president and chief executive officer of
Borland, said "This transaction solidifies the steps we have already
taken to bring our products together as the market's only best-of-breed
suite offering.  It also sharpens Borland's focus to the strategic core
of our business as the leading provider of application development and
PC database software.  Our growing relationship with Novell and
WordPerfect provides opportunities for Borland to ensure we maintain
that leadership."

Borland International Inc. provides database management, programming
languages, development tools, spreadsheets and applications software.
Its products include dBase, Paradox, InterBase, Borland C++, Borland
Pascal with Objects and Quattro Pro.
