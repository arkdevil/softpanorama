             INTRODUCTION: AN OVERVIEW OF THE 1995 BUDGET

  The 1995 budget proposes outlays of $1,518.3 billion, receipts of
$1,342.2 billion, and a deficit of $176.1 billion (Table I-1).  If
this outcome is realized, and the deficit for  1994 (already four
months old) is as expected, it will mark the third consecutive year
the deficit will have decreased (1992, $290.4 billion; 1993, $254.7
billion; 1994, an estimated $234.8 billion)--the first such sequence
since the Administration of President Harry S Truman.  If the
President's health care reform bill is enacted, the 1995 deficit will
be even lower: $165.1 billion.  (Furthermore, these estimates were
made on the basis of economic assumptions as of December 1993.  If
subsequent developments could have been incorporated into the economic
assumptions, the projected deficits over the forecast period--with or
without health reform--would have been about $5 billion to $6 billion
per year lower.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The deficit is cut more than 40 percent from the level projected one
year ago. As a percentage of GDP, it is projected to be cut in
half--from the 5.2 percent that was projected one year ago for 1993
under the policies of the previous Administration, to 2.5 percent in
1995.  It is projected to fall to 2.3 percent and remain there for
1996-99, unless the President's health care reform is enacted.  With
health reform, the deficit is projected to fall to 2.1 percent of GDP
in 1999.  As the President made clear last year, the difference
between a deficit that is falling as a percentage of GDP and one that
is merely stable is fundamental health reform.

  This budget achieves sustained deficit reduction by breaking the bad
fiscal habits of the 1980s.

 o After years of budgets based on  borrow and spend  economics, this
   budget maintains fiscal discipline--the discipline established in
   the President's economic program last year.  The tight
   discretionary spending caps negotiated by the Administration and
   the Congress--which impose a five-year freeze at about the fiscal
   year 1993 level, with no allowance for inflation--are obeyed.
   There are no deficit-increasing changes in entitlement spending or
   revenues.  This budget discipline has already paid enormous
   dividends:  interest rates have declined; business investment in
   equipment, and household investment in new homes, automobiles, and
   other consumer durables have increased; and employment growth has
   returned to the United States.  The economy produced almost twice
   as many jobs in the last year than under the entire preceding
   Administration.

 o Where past budgets have practiced  trickle-down economics,  in the
   vain hope that tax relief for the most well-off would cause
   economic growth for the rest, this budget maintains tax fairness.
   The economic record of the past year demonstrates that growth and
   fairness need not conflict.  The Administration's increases in the
   Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to reward work--a first step toward
   welfare reform--provide sorely needed tax relief for low-income
   working families with children.  At the same time, the necessary
   additional taxes to reduce the deficit are being borne by those
   most able to pay: households with incomes over $200,000 will pay 80
   percent of the tax increases enacted in the President's budget
   package last year. Only the best-off 1.2 percent of households face
   higher income tax rates.

 o Where past budgets lacked a long-term view, this budget invests for
   the future--in the physical infrastructure, scientific and
   technological knowledge, and worker skills that the private sector
   needs to be an engine of job creation and productivity growth.  The
   budget also encourages private business investment--through
   continued deficit reduction and the resulting low interest rates,
   and through the investment incentives (especially for small
   business) enacted in the President's economic program last year.
   These incentives help business to play its role as the ultimate
   source of long-term prosperity.

 o In contrast to past budgets, which lacked credibility and were
   routinely characterized as  dead on arrival,  this budget dispenses
   with smoke and mirrors.  Its economic assumptions are prudent, and
   its budget projections are solid.  It will be a sound basis for the
   Congressional budget process and the public debate as well.

  This introduction identifies and describes the major components of
the 1995 budget.  It identifies the ways in which budget discipline is
attained, and the initiatives that are proposed.  The remainder of the
budget describes in more detail the economic backdrop for the
President's economic plan, the success that the plan has met thus far,
and the President's agenda for the future.

                         ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS

  A year ago, the recovery from the 1990-91 recession was still very
fragile; now it is more secure.  This transformation was the result of
corrective actions taken by the private and public sectors.
Households and businesses improved their balance sheets by reducing
debt.  But most importantly, the Federal Government seriously
addressed its own deficit problem.  Congress enacted the
Administration's deficit reduction plan and refocused spending
priorities on productivity-enhancing investment.

  The return to fiscal responsibility contributed to a fall of one
percentage point in long-term interest rates between the election in
November 1992 and the end of 1993.  Falling rates stimulated key
interest-sensitive sectors, pushed the stock market to record highs
and reduced the debt servicing costs of governments, households and
businesses.  By the second half of 1993, households and businesses
were willing and able to undertake the investment spending that
produces self-sustaining growth. Business and consumer confidence
improved as sales picked up, orders increased, payrolls expanded and
incomes rose.  And even though the economy accelerated during 1993 and
the unemployment rate declined, inflation remained well under control.
Thus, as 1994 begins, the essential elements for sustained,
noninflationary growth are in place.

  The Administration's economic assumptions through 1999 project a
continuation of the trends evident in 1993: real economic growth
sufficiently strong to lower unemployment gradually without reigniting
inflation (Table I-2).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 o Between the fourth quarter of 1993 and the fourth quarter of 1994,
   real GDP is projected to increase 3.0 percent.  From 1995 through
   1999, the growth rate slows progressively to 2.5 percent.

 o The unemployment rate is projected to decline 0.3 percentage point
   in 1994.  (The current employment outlook is even more favorable
   than when these economic assumptions were finalized in December of
   1993.)  Further decreases of about this magnitude are projected
   each year through 1998.

 o Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, is projected to
   be 3.0 percent during 1994, compared with 2.8 percent during 1993.
   As the economy grows further, the inflation rate is assumed to edge
   up slightly, leveling off at 3.4 percent per year during 1997-1999.

 o Short-term interest rates are projected to rise moderately from
   their exceptionally low current levels as the economy expands,
   while long-term rates are projected to remain unchanged at their
   levels at the end of 1993--in keeping with sustained low inflation
   and continued budget discipline.

  The economic assumptions presume enactment of the Administration's
budget proposals.

                               OUTLAYS

  1995 outlays are projected at $1,518.3 billion without the
Administration's health reform proposal, an increase of $34.3 billion,
or 2.3 percent, from 1994 estimates.  Later years show continued slow
outlay growth.  Between 1993 and 1999, total outlays are projected to
grow by an average of only 4.5 percent per year, or about one percent
in real terms.  In contrast, between 1981 and 1993, total outlays grew
by an average of 6.3 percent per year.  In 1999, projected outlays
equal 20.9 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP); in 1993,
outlays equaled 22.4 percent of GDP.  The Administration's health
reform would add a projected $0.6 billion to 1995 outlays.

Discretionary Spending

  Total discretionary outlays decline in 1995, from $550.1 billion in
1994 to $542.4 billion.  Defense discretionary outlays decline from an
estimated $280.6 billion in 1994 to $271.1 billion in 1995.
Non-defense discretionary outlays decrease by almost three percent in
real terms--increasing slightly in nominal terms, from an estimated
$269.5 billion to $271.3 billion, a rise of $1.8 billion, or 0.7
percent.

  The reduction in discretionary spending is not a mindless
across-the-board cut.  Every department and agency was examined to
find potential savings that would have the least possible adverse
effect on the economy and on delivery of public services.  In
addition, the President maintained his commitment to investment in
physical capital, ideas, and people to strengthen the economy,
increase living standards, and create jobs.

  As a result, although total discretionary spending declines from
1994 to 1995, the change varies from department to department.  Seven
of the 14 major departments face a budget cut in nominal terms (ten in
real terms); and the increases in the others, which implement most of
the President's investment, still leave total outlays on the decline
in 1995 (Table I-3).

  Spending cuts. Not surprisingly, given that total discretionary
spending is cut, the 1995 budget reduces budget authority in dollar
terms--without any increase for inflation--in at least 300 programs,
including at least 115 terminations (some listed in Table I-4), and in
228 of 636 programmatic budget accounts. Another 51 of the 636 budget
accounts are frozen at the 1994 level, with no increase for inflation;
and another 100 receive dollar increases that are less than would be
needed to keep up with inflation.  Thus, 379 of 636 budget accounts
are cut in real terms.

  The reductions are spread throughout the Government. Low-priority
and less-efficient programs are cut or eliminated, to reduce the
deficit and to finance investments that strengthen the economy,
safeguard the environment, and fight crime.  However, even some
programs in the President's general investment areas are cut--to free
funds for more-efficient programs that pursue the same high-priority
objectives better.  These include 33 separate program terminations in
the Department of Education; some low-income housing reductions in the
Department of Housing and Urban Development; the youth training grants
under the Job Training Partnership Act in the Department of Labor;
mass transit operating subsidies; and three program terminations and
numerous reductions in the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.

  Budget savings are also obtained through the President's Executive
Order requiring Federal personnel reductions of 100,000 by 1995, and
the National Performance Review recommendation for an additional
152,000 reduction by 1999; and the President's Executive Order
requiring administrative expense reductions of 3 percent in 1994,
increasing to 14 percent in 1997.

  Investments. While total discretionary spending declines, budget
discipline and spending cuts in every department and agency make room
for targeted increases in programs important to the economy and the
society.  The President requests a total increase of $13.7 billion in
budgetary resources, or 18 percent ($7.7 billion in outlays, or 11
percent), in the discretionary spending that embodies much of his
investment program (Table I-5).  Over the past two budget years, these
programs have been increased by a total of $23.0 billion in budgetary
resources,  or 35 percent ($15.3 billion of outlays, or 23 percent),
while total discretionary outlays have decreased by $0.1 billion.

  These figures demonstrate clearly that this Administration has been
making tough choices--maintaining budget discipline and reducing
spending, but shifting the limited budget dollars into investment
programs that invest in people and contribute to a strong economy.

  The discretionary investment programs in the 1995 budget include:

 o Economic growth: investing in people. Substantial investments are
   proposed in education, ranging from Head Start through title I for
   disadvantaged elementary students and GOALS 2000 for elementary and
   secondary school reform, through school-to-work transition
   assistance for non-college-bound secondary-school students.
   Training investments include the Workforce Security initiative to
   provide a new reemployment system, and a significant expansion of
   the Job Corps.  The national service program is expanded, allowing
   more young people to serve their communities and earn money towards
   college.  Other investments for people include WIC, to nourish
   pregnant and post-partum women, infants, and children; new
   resources for dealing with the backlog of Social Security
   Disability Insurance claims; increases in grants for assistance to
   the homeless; and food safety inspections and research. Overall
   investments increase by over 8 percent next year and 23 percent
   over the next five years. Investments for children increase 10
   percent in 1995 and 25 percent in the next five years.

 o Economic growth: investing in science and technology. The budget
   strengthens programs that promote growth, job creation, and
   environmental quality in U.S. businesses through cost-shared,
   applied research.  It provides major increases for the Advanced
   Technology Program in the National Institute of Standards and
   Technology of the Department of Commerce; the Technology
   Reinvestment Project and other dual-use programs in the Department
   of Defense; and development of the National Information
   Infrastructure.  Support for fundamental science is bolstered
   through increases in funding for the National Science Foundation
   and the National Institutes of Health.

 o Economic growth: investing in infrastructure. The largest
   investments include full funding of the Intermodal Surface
   Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) core highways program; a
   substantial increase of the mass transit formula capital grants;
   and the Department of Agriculture's rural development initiative.

 o Economic growth: investing in the environment. Natural resource and
   environment initiatives in the Departments of Agriculture,
   Commerce, Energy, Interior, the Corps of Engineers, and the
   Environmental Protection Agency focus on international issues, such
   as global climate change; particular U.S. ecosystems, such as the
   Pacific Northwest Forest; cleanup of Defense, Energy, and Superfund
   sites; energy conservation; stewardship for safe and clean water
   and land management; and enforcement of the nation's environmental
   protection laws. Overall, these investments increase by 4 percent
   in 1995--and 7 percent over the next five years from spending
   levels in the previous Administration.

 o Health investments. Substantial funding increases are provided to
   the National Institutes of Health, Ryan White Act AIDS treatment
   program, the President's immunization program, and for drug
   treatment.  Still further investments are included in the
   President's comprehensive health reform. The increases come to 40
   percent over the next five years.

 o Crime and drug abuse. The Crime Bill currently in the Congress
   provides a substantial increase for a broad range of activities
   within the Department of Justice.  The President's initiative to
   put an additional 100,000 police on the streets is one part of the
   budget plan. Drug treatment--especially for hard-core users--is
   another important part of the Administration's new strategy. It
   concentrates resources at the local level and shifts international
   resources from transit interdiction to in-country efforts against
   drug production. The increases reach 18 percent in 1995, and 45
   percent over the next five years.

 o National security. The Administration funds--and the President
   supports as an irreducible minimum--a military that is ready,
   technologically superior, and oriented to the new threats in our
   changing world, in keeping with the Bottom-Up Review undertaken
   last year by the Department of Defense.

  All of these investments are undertaken within a declining overall
level of discretionary spending--made possible through the President's
Executive Orders reducing Federal personnel and overhead expenses, and
through hard choices among competing priorities.

Mandatory Spending

  Mandatory, or entitlement, spending is projected to increase from
$730.4 billion in 1994 to $762.9 billion in 1995, an increase of $32.5
billion, or 4.4 percent, in the absence of the President's health
reform.

  Though projected mandatory outlays grow more rapidly in 1995 than
discretionary spending (outlays other than debt service grow by 4.4
percent from 1994, and debt service costs grow by 4.8 percent),
mandatory spending growth is significantly below its recent pace.  For
example, from 1981 to 1993, mandatory outlays other than debt service
and deposit insurance grew by 7.2 percent per year; debt service grew
by 9.2 percent per year.  The slower projected growth for this budget
year is due in part to the improving economy, which reduces the
Federal Government's unemployment and income-support costs, as well as
the costs of deposit insurance; and in part to strict compliance with
the pay-as-you-go restrictions on mandatory spending increases in the
Budget Enforcement Act.

  Projected outlay growth in 1995 is distributed unevenly across
entitlement categories.  Medicare and Medicaid grow 8.9 and 10.6
percent, respectively--much faster than any other category of spending
(Table I-6).  Other entitlements--Social Security, the other non-means
tested entitlements (including Federal employee civilian and military
retirement programs, veterans programs, unemployment compensation, and
other programs), and the other means-tested entitlements for
low-income persons (food stamps, family support assistance, and other
programs)--all grow at below or very little more than the average rate
of growth of spending, and below the rate of growth of revenues.

  This pattern demonstrates again the crucial role of health care
costs in the Federal budget.  Of all the categories of spending,
discretionary or mandatory, health care is far and away the fastest
growing.  As the President has pointed out on numerous occasions, we
will not control our deficit until we achieve fundamental health
reform.  The President's proposal would reach both of these
objectives--as the alternative deficit paths in this budget, with and
without health care reform, illustrate.

  Initiatives. The Administration contemplates several major
initiatives in the mandatory spending arena:

 o Health reform, as discussed above, is essential to long-term
   control of the Federal budget deficit--and to the health security
   of all Americans.  The President's proposal, presented last year,
   will provide guaranteed private insurance with a comprehensive
   package of benefits, and enhance competition among providers and
   insurers to keep costs down.

 o Welfare reform will fundamentally revamp a system that encourages
   dependency rather than independence, and fails to reward work.  It
   will provide the training and services that parents need to support
   their families--including health coverage--but require
   responsibility in return.  It will simplify what is now an
   excessively complex system, and give States greater flexibility.

 o Workforce security--a reemployment system, rather than our outmoded
   unemployment system--will focus resources on workers who must make
   the inevitable adjustments in a changing economy.  It will screen
   new job-losers to provide the needed combination of counseling,
   training, and job-search assistance, in a more accessible, unified
   system to replace the current patchwork of categorical programs.

 o The recently negotiated Uruguay Round agreements under the General
   Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) will open foreign markets to
   a broader range of competitive U.S. producers of goods and services
   than ever before, and thereby increase U.S. incomes and contribute
   to long-term deficit control.

  All of these initiatives will be deficit-neutral, in keeping with
the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Budget Enforcement Act.

                               RECEIPTS

  1995 receipts are projected at $1,342.2 billion, an increase of
$93.0 billion, or 7.4 percent, in the absence of the proposed health
reform. All new receipts raised by OBRA-93 are deposited in the
Deficit Reduction Fund created by an Executive Order of the President.
The health reform proposal would add $11.6 billion in receipts, all to
pay for health care.

  Receipts increases in 1995--as did those in 1994--reflect the
President's deficit-reduction plan of last year, and the affected
receipts sources grow the most rapidly as a result (Table I-7).  The
budget contains no tax increase proposals.

                               DEFICIT

  As a result of this budget discipline, the deficit is projected to
decline in 1995 to $176.1 billion, from the 1994 level of $234.8
billion.  If this projection is realized, it will be the first
sub-$200 billion deficit since 1989.

  More reflective of the impact of the deficit, however, is its size
relative to the economy.  The 1995 deficit is a projected 2.5 percent
of the GDP, down from an estimated 3.5 percent for 1994, and an actual
4.9 percent for 1992.  At 2.5 percent of GDP, the 1995 deficit is the
lowest since 1979.  Thus end the economic policies of the 1980s.

  Without health reform, the deficit is projected to fall to 2.3
percent of GDP for the remainder of the decade.  With health reform,
the deficit as a percentage of GDP fluctuates in a narrow range as
costs and savings from the plan phase in; but by 1999, the deficit
falls to 2.1 percent of GDP.

  This much-improved deficit outlook is confirmed by the projections
of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). On average over the history
of five-year budget projections under the two preceding
Administrations, CBO projected deficits that were higher by $47
billion per year. In this budget, CBO projects deficits that are lower
by an average of $3 billion per year.

  These figures reflect the major impacts of the President's economic
plan--both the first installment enacted last year, and the agenda
remaining.  The economic plan thus far has contained the deficit, and
thereby restored the economy to healthy growth--with rising
investment, productivity, and employment.  The next stage of the
economic plan--centered around health reform, continued budget
discipline, and the President's investment program--will put the
deficit on a continuing downward path, provide health security to all
Americans, and remove further barriers to competitiveness and economic
growth.  The President is committed to this program of continued
deficit reduction and higher investment to achieve long-term economic
growth and prosperity for all Americans.

  This budget begins the second stage of President Clinton's program
of economic renewal.
