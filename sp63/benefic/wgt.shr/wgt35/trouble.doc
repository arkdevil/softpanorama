Troubleshooting:
----------------

Most of the problems from experience, are tring to load files from
the wrong directory. This can cause a lot of mess on the screen and
perhaps a few lock ups. Look for this problem right away.
If everything seems to be alright, read on...


Problem:  When I set the palette with wsetpalette, all the colours remain
	  black...
Solution: You should have set the palette beforehand, with wsetrgb,
	  wloadpalette, or wloadsprites. If you have set the palette,
	  make sure the palette file was found if you are loading it in.



Problem:  When using the multidirectional scrolling, my objects do not show up
	  on top of the background.

Solution: First, make sure the variable numsprites contains the highest
	  object number you are using.  Second, make sure you compile
	  your program with word alignment OFF. To do this, set
	  the option under Options/Compiler/Code Generation, or
	  use the appropriate switch from the command line compiler.
	  Also make sure your object sprite file was loaded alright.	 



Problem:  My program compiles fine, but it gives me a stack overflow error
	  when I run it.

Solution: Make sure you compile your program using the large memory model.
	  If you are using the region fill routine, type
  	   _stklen=64000;
 	  at the beginning of your program to make sure the fill works fine.



Problem:  My program gives me an out of memory or out of heap space error.

Solution: Set the heap size under the Options/Debugger menu to a large
	  number. This will change how much memory Turbo C gives it
	  when it runs. For the maximum amount, set it to 640. This will
	  make sure you can run very large programs.  If that doesn't
	  work, try running it from DOS, or cut down the memory
	  needed temporarily.


Problem:  Some of the example files do not seem to work right, and I
	  must use a control break to end.

Solution: Many of the example programs require a mouse to operate.
	  If you do not have a mouse, you will not be able to use
	  that particular program. Browse through the program to see
	  what exactly it is looking for to continue.  Sometimes
	  it is waiting for a keypress which you did not hit.


Problem:  When I use the fade_in, fade_out, or wsetpalette functions,
	  the screen flickers and "snow" appears. What is happening?

Solution: This screen disturbance occurs when you set the palette entries.
	  There is no way to get rid of the snow completely, however
	  there are a few things you can do. Try setting fewer palette
	  entries at once, and use a larger delay if you are fading the
	  colours in or out.


Problem:  When I display a sprite or a block on the screen, a mess
	  appears.

Solution: The block file or sprite file you loaded in was not found.
	  When you attempt to display the block or sprite, the data
	  in memory is undefined and it displays whatever was in
	  memory at that address before you ran your program.
	  Check to see the paths are correct in your load statements.
	  This error is common when you have first installed WGT
	  on your hard drive since it will depend on where you
	  copied the files.  You need to change the pathnames in
	  any operations which load a file.
