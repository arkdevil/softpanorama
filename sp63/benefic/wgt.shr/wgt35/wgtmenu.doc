				WGT Menus

WGT Menus provides a quick and easy method of selecting options
available to the end user. If you have a mouse, you can simply
move to the item you want, and click the mouse button. If do
not have a mouse, use the arrow keys to move around in the
drop down menus.


Creating a drop down menu:

First you need to define what the names of the drop down menus will be.
This is done be entering them into an array at the beginning of your
program:

char *menubar[10]={" QUIT  "," FILES "," Menu 1 "," Menu 2 ",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL};

These names will appear on the 'menu bar' at the top of the screen.
Notice how some are 'NULL'. These will not show anything on the menu bar.
I suggest you put spaces on either side of the names, to keep the choices
apart. When a user moves the mouse over these names (or presses F10 when
there is no mouse installed), a sub-menu will appear.

To define the sub-menus, you must enter each choice as follows:

dropdown[0].choice[0]=" Help ";
dropdown[0].choice[1]=" Quit ";
dropdown[1].choice[0]=" Load ";
dropdown[1].choice[1]=" Save ";
	 ^         ^
Menu # --|         |--Choice #


This would make sub-menus under the first and second drop-down choices.
It would look like this:

   Quit    Files    Menu 1    Menu 2
 | Help || Load |
 | Quit || Save |
 |------||------|

The format for sub-menus is:
dropdown[n].choice[n]="Your choice"

with n ranging from 0 to 9.

This means you can have up to 10 drop down menus, with up to 10
choices in each, for a total of 100 choices available to the user
at a click of the mouse button!


Available functions:

void initdropdowns();

Initializes drop-down menus and sub-menus.
You must call this after you have defined the drop down menus and
sub-menus.
If you change the text in the menus, (such as toggling choices) you
may need to call this again, to get the correct sizes for the sub-menus.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
void showmenubar();

Shows the drop-down menu bar at the top of the screen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
int checkmenu();

Loops until the user selects a choice from the menu bar or clicks
the mouse button outside of the menu bar.
If a selection is made, it returns the number of the menu choice.

If you selected this choice, it would return the number 11.
dropdown[1].choice[1]=" Save ";

result= menu*10   + choice
      = 1*10      + 1
      = 11

If the mouse is clicked outside the menu, it returns -1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
void removemenubar();

Removes the menu bar from the screen.

Available variables:

Each drop down menu can have different colours.
To set them, set the following variables:

dropdown[0].color=?
dropdown[0].bordercolor=?
dropdown[0].textcolor=?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The menu bar can have different colours as well by setting:

menubarcolor=254;
menubartextcolor=1;
bordercolor=255;
highlightcolor=144;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To see if the mouse is installed, check the variable:

int mouseinstalled;    =1 if installed, 0 if not installed

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At default, the hotkey which brings the drop down menus from the keyboard
is F10. You can change this key by changing the value in

char menuhotkey;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With WGT Menus, you can create menus with any font you like.
To change the font, load a new one in with wloadfont and set

wgtfont menufont;

eg. myfont=wloadfont("the_font.fnt");
    menufont=myfont;
