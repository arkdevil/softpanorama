	What Is This System For ?
	-------------------------
	
	The library system was designed to allow programmers to combine
	all of their data files into one large password-protected file.
	This file is then accessed by your programs using a unit included
	with the package. It can drastically reduce the number of files
	sitting around in a directory, and reduces the chances that one
	of the necessary files is stored in an improper directory.

	Our original use of this system was for the WGT programming kits
	for designing 320*200*256 graphics programs. Our system saves
	palette files, bit-blocks, compressed images, sprite files,
	maps for games, etc. This built up into a huge number of data
	files when we designed a game or utility. To relieve the pressure
	of finding the files, WGTLIB.EXE was created.




	WGTLIB.EXE
	----------

	WGTLIB.EXE is the basis of the entire system. It is a DOS parameter
	based program which combines the given files into a LIBRARY. You
	begin by specifying a library filename, password (if desired), and
	then specify individual filenames. To understand how it works, I
	will show several examples of legal commands.

	Options:
		+          Add file to library
		-          Remove file from library
		*          Extract file without removing it
		-* or *-   Extract file and remove it from library
		+$	   Add password to library
		-$	   Remove password from library
		*$	   Modify existing password
		@	   Execute commands in listfile

	Examples:
	---------
	
	To update a library file called TEST.LIB and add LIBFILE.DOC,
TYPE	WGTLIB TEST.LIB +LIBFILE.DOC (enter)

	To update TEST.LIB and add two files and a password,
TYPE	WGTLIB TEST.LIB +WGTLIB.EXE +$MYPASSWORD +LIBFILE.TPU

	To view the contents of TEST.LIB (with password),
TYPE    WGTLIB TEST.LIB #MYPASSWORD

	To remove WGTLIB.EXE from TEST.LIB,
TYPE	WGTLIB TEST.LIB #MYPASSWORD -WGTLIB.EXE

	To remove the password from TEST.LIB,
TYPE	WGTLIB TEST.LIB #MYPASSWORD -$

	To execute all commands within a listfile,
TYPE	WGTLIB TEST.LIB @MAKEFILE.DAT
	Where MAKEFILE.DAT contains +,-,*,-* or *-,+$,-$,*$ commands
	(one per line)


	NOTES:
		-any time you specify a library filename which does not
		 exist, WGTLIB creates a new file
		-once a password is added, you must specify what it is
		 using # and the password as the second parameter for
		 all subsequent commands
		-removing a password only requires a -$, no other parameters
		-full pathnames are accepted anywhere a filename is used
		-passwords are a maximum of 15 characters



	Commands which use the library files created with this program
are contained within the documentation of WGT version 3.0. 
Using a library file is very simple:

Initialize the library file by calling
	setlib("libfile.wlb");
If you set a password on the file, call
	setpassword("secret");
All other commands in WGT which load something off the disk will look
in the library file. To test it, make a new directory and copy your
program and the library file. Do not copy the separate files you put
inside the library file. Try running the program. It should work with
no problems unless you forgot to put a file in the library, or you
have pathnames in your load commands.
Note: FLI files cannot be run from a WGT library file.



	Suggestions for files to store in a library:
	--------------------------------------------

	1) Anything which you would like to remain hidden from the user.
	2) Graphics images to be used in a program.
	3) Sound files (VOC,CMF,MOD)
	4) EXE'S and COM's that you rarely use (ZIP the library and store
	   on a floppy). This prevents separation of related files when
	   backing up information.
	5) Drivers, etc. which a program requires to run. A neat trick is
	   to store multiple drivers within the library. If you use different
	   video, sound, or printer drivers according to the user's setup,
	   you can store all the posibilities in one file. Then when the
	   program runs, it loads the appropriate driver into a buffer and
	   outputs it to disk. Now the user has only the necessary files in
	   the directory. (can be done in memory instead of disk obviously)
	6) Programmers can store all files to deal with a particular
	   project in one file. I use it to store my source code for each
	   version of a shareware release that I create.
	7) Anything else that I haven't thought of.
