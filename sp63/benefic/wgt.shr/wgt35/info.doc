The WordUp Graphics Toolkit is shareware.  Shareware is a great concept of 
'try before you buy'.  Try out the library for as long as you want. 
I say this because your programming skills may vary from other people,
and it may take you longer to get used to graphics programming. If you
decide you want to write a program with the library, register it by
filling out the order form included with this package. More details
about benefits from registering are later...
Please spread this package to everyone you know, and upload it to any BBS
you call.  Doing so will help our product be more valuable to you if we get
some suggestions. 

Software Vendors may distribute this package, as long as the sprite creator,
and map editor are included as well. No files should be modified or left out
of the package. If you have a catalog of your titles, please send us a copy
which contains a listing of this package.


	We wish to thank several of our registered users for their help in
bringing success to our business. Thanks to Steven Salter (INDIANA), for his
continuous onslaught of code and suggestions, without which we'd get very
bored. Thanks to Vu Truong (CALIFORNIA) for the creation of the first full-
fledged game, STELCON 2469, made with WGT systems. Thanks to Felix Wu (ONTARIO),
for the FLI playing documentation which allowed us to provide support in
version 3. Thanks to Steven Racki (ONTARIO) for being the FIRST registered
user of our products. And thanks to Michael Prunner (AUSTRIA) for being our
first overseas registered user.

Here are some of the facts about WGT v3.5:

Map Maker	- Create game worlds with 16*16 pixel bitmaps (tiles)
   ($20)	- Map dimensions up to 320*200 tiles (higher in future!)
		- Allows placement of sprites over background to set initial
		  positions in game
		- 'Paint' your map in EDIT mode like a drawing program
		- Assign each of (up to) 200 tiles a unique type value
		  (each value can represent a physical property in a program)
		- Allows up to 1000 sprites on each map!

Sprite Creator  - Easily create sprites with superb editor
   ($20)	- Added capability to copy block of sprites to another location
		- PCX and CEL support improved
		- GIF and PCX saving support added
		- Store 1000 sprites in one file!

Turbo C++ system- Over 110 unique functions
   ($40)	- Operates in 320x200x256 VGA standard mode
		- Most of the difficult programming has already been done for 
		  you! Don't worry about how to make moving & animating
		  sprites, or multidirectional scrolling. It's already built in!
		- custom fonts may be loaded and displayed
   		- custom drop down menu system
		- flip, warp, and FAST resize block
		- FLI playing routines (flexible, can resize while playing,
		  can animate sprites over FLI, etc.)
		- Multidirectional scrolling of game worlds in window on screen
		  (window from 2*2 tiles to 17*10, frame rate varies with size)
		- WGTLIB executable packs any given files into one large file
		  with password protection, your program will automatically
		  load from this file with the addition of only two lines of
		  source code!
		- SoundBlaster CMF and VOC routines
		- Joystick and mouse routines
		- Timing control	


In the future   - Extended control over maps (transparent maps with picture
		  in background, can play FLI in background while map scrolls
		  in front!)
		- we are considering creation of two-player mode for maps
		  which puts two small windows on the screen and allows two
		  players to play in same game (independent map control will
		  allow players to be in different areas at same time)
		- EMS/XMS support

	  *********** PROGRAMMING CONTEST ANNOUNCEMENT ***********


	We are now running a programming contest open to all registered
	users of WGT systems. The idea of the contest is to create a quality
	program of any sort (game, utility, etc) using WGT. We are doing
	this to generate further interest in our product, as well as
	offer a reward to those who produce with it. All submissions should
	be sent to our mailing address on, or before December 31, 1993.
	Judging will take place until February. The winner will be announced
	on February 1, 1994. They will be notified by mail, as well as a
	public message broadcast through E-mail on PC-networks and
	Internet.

	Submissions will be judged based on concept, design, effectiveness,
	completeness, documentation, bugs, and overall rating. We are not
	going to judge based on the type of program, but rather the
	professional result.

	The first prize is $80.00 in cash. This would be a full refund of
	money invested in WGT if you registered everything for version 3 or
	later.
	
	The second prize is a lifetime of free upgrades for all WGT products.

	All programs must, in some screen during execution, mention the
	WordUp Graphics Toolkit by WordUp Software Productions,
	and our mailing address. We ask also, that we be given the right to
	promote our systems by distribution of your product (if it is not
	commercial) with our future releases. We will fully support your efforts
	by helping to advertise your final product. When a potential customer
	asks about WGT, we want to refer them to your software.

	As far as code goes, we don't want source. We will judge only the
	final product. You may combine our system with other libraries
	(eg. sound, memory, disk storage, screen output, etc).

	Write to us if you have any further questions.
