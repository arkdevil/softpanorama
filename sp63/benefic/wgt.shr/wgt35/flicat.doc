			    Overview of Algorithm
			    ---------------------

	This program is not intended to be the most efficient, or most complex
form of a concatenation program for FLI files (copyright Autodesk I believe).
It will assume that all files will be the same resolution and speed, and uses
the values given in the first file to store. There will be a slight flicker
(or flash) between sequences because the palettes are different.

	The basic idea for the program is as follows:

a)	Will create a file with the name given by the user
b)	Will add up to 10 FLI files into that one file, splicing them together
c)	Source is Turbo Pascal
d)	The presence of any corrupt FLI files will terminate the program before
	creation of the new file


Step 1 - Parameters
-------------------
	The parameters will be passed at the command line for simplicity. A
typical session would be FLICAT NEWFLI.FLI C:\FLIS\NEAT.FLI C:\FLIS\WOW.FLI

This would take the initial settings of the file NEAT.FLI and use the speed
and resolution values as standard for the entire sequence. The program will
start by analyzing the files to determine the portions to include and the
total number of frames and new file size. An end product of this example would
be a file called NEWFLI.FLI which consists of the other two combined.

Step 2 - Analysis
-----------------
	The program checks each specified file to make sure it is an FLI,
stores the number of bytes to copy from within the file during concatenation,
and increases the total number of frames in the end product. FLI files always
contain one more frame than the header specifies, and this frame is used to
bring the screen back to resemble the first frame in the file. For our
purposes, I decided it would be simpler just to copy the first frame over again
instead of calculating the difference between the first and last frames.

Step 3 - Creation
-----------------
	The program will notify you of the final file size, and then begin
concatenating the files together. The reason we had to analyze each first was
to calculate the number of bytes to copy minus the main FLI header and the
extra frame. Now we copy those segments into the new file, and then create our
extra frame by duplicating the first frame of file 1.

	The included source code is free to be distributed, modified, or
used as is. I would appreciate the mention of my contributions to this idea
in any future upgrades or releases. Please give credit where credit is due.
