			WGT FLI Playing Library
 		     Copyright 1993 Chris Egerter

	This library allows you to play FLI files from AutoDesk's Animator.
While it is playing, you can have sprites moving overtop, resize the
whole FLI as it is playing, perform special effects, and much more.
The FLI player is very versatile, and allows you to do anything with
the flick as it runs. This version reads the FLI file from disk. When
you register, you will receive a version of the library which holds the
fli in memory. This speeds up the animation, at the expense of memory, but
the disk drive won't be going constantly when you play a flick. This means
you could have sprites moving around the screen while an animated FLI
background plays.

Using the FLI player is simple. Here are the basic commands:

	openfli(char *filename);
	   Initializes and verifies FLI file.
	   Example: openfli("C:\\tc\\bin\\myfli.fli");

	nextframe();
	   Loads in the next frame of the FLI onto the virtual screen
	   fliscreen. To show the FLI, you must copy the fliscreen to
	   the visual screen in some way. (See copyfli).
	   Example: nextframe();

	copyfli();
	   Copies fliscreen to the visual screen. You can also use other
	   techniques of showing the FLI. Fliscreen is just a full screen
	   block. You can set this to any of your previously allocated
	   full screen blocks. You can manipulate the block like any
	   other, for special effects. The usual way of showing the FLI
	   is copyfli(), but you could also use wresize,wwipe,wfade,
	   wwarp, wskew, etc etc.
	   Example: copyfli(); // shows FLI

	   Or try this: wresize(0,0,160,100,fliscreen); // resizes flick

 	closefli();
	   Shuts down the FLI, and closes the file.
	   Example: closefli();

Variables available to you:
  flickdly: The delay of the current FLI playng.
              It is up to you to make a delay if you wish.

  framenumber: The current frame shown.
   	       NOTE: The first frame is only shown once, and the FLI
	       plays one more frame than AA says there is. Once the
	       last frame is played, framenumber loops back to frame 2
	       even though it looks like frame 1 is being played. This
	       is because AA stores an extra frame at the end showing
 	       the differences between the first and last frames.

   flicp1,flicp2,flicp3,flicp4: Defines the last rectangular region which
		changed, and must be copied to the visual screen.	       

   Maxframe:  The number of frames in the current FLI file.

That's all there is to it. It is very simple, yet you can manipulate the
FLI in many ways as it is playing!

Note: FLI files have been tested from AutoDesk's Animator, not the Pro
version.
