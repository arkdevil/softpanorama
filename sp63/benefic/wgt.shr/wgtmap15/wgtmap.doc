			     WGT Map Maker  v1.5
                             Crippleware Release
			     -------------------

	This program is a crippleware version of the WGT Map Maker version 1.5
and is designed specifically for use with the WGT library systems. It is
designed as a utility to create game worlds (using tile maps) and has
several limitations:

        ****** Fully functional except for SAVE feature ******
                You MUST register this product to save.
	a) You must create all bitmap images with the WGT Sprite Creator.
	b) All sprites in a tile file must be 16*16 pixels with no
	   substitutions.
	c) Version 1.5 file selector only displays files from the drive which
	   it was started on.
	d) All tile/object files are expected to use the same palette if they
	   are to be displayed simultaneously. Keep this in mind when designing
	   the bitmaps (don't make tiles with one palette, objects with another)




***** Software Agreement *****

The Crippleware version is intended to be passed around to as many users
as possible. It may be copied freely, and uploaded to any location you
wish to send it. Users should be notified that the SAVE feature does not
work, to prevent the loss of a few hours work. We have been forced to produce
our utilities in crippleware format after discovering that many shareware
copies were being used commercially. If you believe that this product is
worth $20.00, you are encouraged to register. This entitles you to full
technical and theoretical support, as well as upgrades when available.




Release 1.5 Notes:

	It was discovered that on some faster processors the PLOT mode locked
because it was polling the mouse too fast. This version allows you to enter
a delay time at the command line to adjust to meet your needs. If the system
locks in PLOT mode, or the mouse behaves strangely, try this at the command
line:
	C:\ WGTMAP 20         (Sets a delay of 20 in the PLOT loop)
Trial and error will determine the correct speed for your system.

Basic Information about Maps
----------------------------

Game worlds are often difficult to store on a computer system without using
large amounts of memory. The best approach to designing a complex environment
for graphical characters is by using tiles. Each tile contains a 'piece' of the
background screen. Frequently used images can then be described by indicating
a number for a particular tile. This saves space in memory and on disk. Some
important figures to remember about this system are as follows:

* Each map is made up of a maximum of 320*200 tiles, a minimum of 20*10 (w*h)
* Each tile is expected to be 16*16 pixels in mode 13h for the VGA card
* A single tile file (created with Sprite Creator) contains up to 200 tiles
* Each map uses only 1 tile file at a time
* Objects are the characters and creatures you want to superimpose over the
  background map, and they are created with the Sprite Creator as well
* Each tile may be assigned a special value to be used to indicate the TYPE
  of tile it is. This value is in the range 0..255 and may be interpreted
  by the users program in whatever manner is desired
* Object files may have up to 1000 bitmaps (Sprites)

Starting Out
------------
	Begin your session with the Sprite Creator (version 2.0 or greater).
You should set the image size (upper right hand corner of the screen) to
reflect 16 pixels in width and 16 pixels tall. Create your sprites and store
each one in a different location. We recommend that you store all tiles with
similar properties in groups. For example, if you are creating a wall, or some
ground tiles, place all of these in sequential sprite locations. You may then
store all objects that your characters may pass over in another sequential
group. The reason for this may not be evident, but it will become apparent
when you start your program code.

	Save your images to a file, and exit the program. You are now ready
to start with the Map Maker. You should have a batch file set up to switch to
the Map Maker's directory and run the program. The program will not be able
to find its data files if you are not in the correct directory.

	Once the Map Maker passes its opening screen, you will be presented
with the following screen layout:
*******************************************************************************
*SIZE                                                 EDIT   PICK   PLOT   MAP*

WGTMAP Keyboard Summary
-----------------------
     F1          -  Displays this summary
     ESC         -  Aborts file selection process
     F5          -  Enter PICK mode
     F6          -  Enter PLOT mode
     F7          -  Enter MAP mode
     F10         -  Ends program (be sure to save first)
     S           -  Displays status menu (not in EDIT mode)
     O           -  Enters object menu (only in OBJECT mode)
     Cursor keys -  Move highlighted cursor in file selection
     + and -     -  Advance to next/previous object in memory (OBJECT mode)
     N           -  Toggles numerical display of objects (OBJECT mode)
     G           -  Toggles 16 pixel grid lock (OBJECT mode)




LOAD Options
------------

NONE  -  Select this if you don't want to load anything

TILES -  A Map Maker session always begins with this selection. This brings up
	 a file selection screen and prompts for the user to select a tile file
	 to load. See FILE SELECTION.

MAP     -  Loads a previously stored map file for editing. This loads in the
           map data, the object location data, and the tile type data for that
	   particular map.

OBJECTS -  Loads the creatures and characters you will superimpose on the map
	   so that you may see what they will look like. Map Maker also allows
	   you to set the initial locations of these objects as well as their
	   display state (on/off). This prevents the programmer from trying
	   to calculate starting positions when doing their code.

TYPES   -  Loads a 200 byte file containing the tile types for each of the
           200 tiles. Each has a value 0-255.



SAVE Options
------------

NONE    -  This aborts the SAVE menu if you have changed your mind

MAP     -  Saves the current map, object information, and type values into
           a map file. You must specify the filename for the system, as it
           does not assume you want to use the same name as when you loaded
           the data.

TYPES   -  Creates a 200 byte file with the type values for the current tile
           set. Use this feature if you wish to use similar values for many
           different maps.



FILE SELECTION                                                        Page 5
--------------
        The file selection screen is a generic system for loading and saving
specified files. WGTMAP will only load 132 files of any given extension into
memory at one time. If your directory contains more than 132 files of a given
type, they will not all be accessible. This figure should be sufficient for
MAP and SPRITE file listings.
        The current map filename is displayed in the upper left-hand corner,
the current directory and extension mask on the upper right. Options are
displayed along the bottom line, along with a reminder of what you are doing.
Pressing ESCAPE will abort file selection, F1 will allow you to type in a
filename manually, F2 will change the file extension to be used for that
particular file type (TILE, MAP, OBJECT).
        You may use the mouse to select a file or directory as well as the
cursor keys. Pressing the left button while positioning the cursor over a
file will highlight that file. Pressing the right button will select that file
or directory. On the keyboard, ENTER has this effect. If you selected a
subdirectory, the file manager will redisplay files within that area.



PICK Mode
---------
	Selecting PICK will enter the tile selection screen. All loaded tiles
will be displayed in the work area and the two active tile boxes (lower left-
hand corner) show the current work tiles. This screen allows you to assign
a tile to each mouse button (2 button mouse). Place the mouse over the desired
tile and click either the left or right button. The active tile box for that
button should now display that tile. After you have selected your working
tiles, select PLOT.



PLOT Mode
---------
	This option places the map into the work area. You may place a tile
on the map by pressing either the left or the right button when the desired
location is highlited. World co-ordinates are displayed on the bottom panel to
help you in map design. These values are between 1 and 320 (x direction) and
1 and 200 for the y direction. You may scroll any direction by clicking on the
SCROLL PAD. A faster method involves the MAP option.


SCROLL PAD
----------
	The nine boxes on the lower right-hand corner of the display allow the
user to scroll around their map in the appropriate direction. The left mouse
button will scroll 1 tile at a time, the right button will scroll 2 at a time,
and users with a three button mouse may scroll 4 at a time with the middle
button. Higher speeds may be achieved by holding combinations of buttons.


MAP Mode
----------
	Selecting MAP from the top menu bar will bring up a condensed version
of your entire map (centered on the screen). Your cursor will become a 20*10
pixel rectangle (to select the next PLOT location). Click with either button
when the cursor is over the desired location. The system will go into PLOT mode
and display the new map section.






                                                                     Page 6
EDIT Mode ( Only available if XMS is being used )
---------
	This option puts the user into a paint-style drawing mode. Left and
right buttons still apply for all functions. Two screen areas are used in this
mode, one being the function selection panel, the other is a condensed map.
Pressing ENTER swaps the cursor between areas. An important note, this feature
requires an extra 64k of memory, and may cause problems if you are short of
memory. Do not use this feature unless you have about 100k or more of free
memory (main). If XMS is being used, some of the extra buffers are allocated
there.


DRAW (Pencil)
-------------
In this mode, single tiles are placed on the map while the user presses
either button. Generally not a desired function due to difficult accuracy
control on the user's part.

LINE
----
Click and hold the mouse button to draw a line with an active tile.
The line begins where the button was pressed, and ends where it was released.

BAR
---
Controls are similar to LINE, except result is a solid bar between co-ordinates.

RECTANGLE
---------
Same as bar, but hollow image.

REGION FILL
-----------
Fills a region bounded by any other tile than the one on which the button
is clicked. Very good for filling ground and sky regions, for example.

GET SECTION
-----------
Controls are similar to bar, except result is the capture of that portion of
the map to be used as a PASTE section. User automatically enters PUT mode
after capture.

PUT SECTION
-----------
Once a map section has been captured with GET SECTION, you may paste copies
of it anywhere on the map.

QUIT
----
Exits EDIT mode.



                                                                      Page 7
SIZE Menu
---------
	This brings up a menu which allows you to set the height and width
of your map. Map data is not lost when you set it to a smaller size. If you
decide to increase the size later, you will see the previous data on the
condensed map. Remember this if you load a map and increase its size.


OBJECT Mode
-----------
	This option allows placement of objects in their initial positions.
The screen will flash while in object placement mode. You cannot enter this
mode unless an object file (sprites) has been loaded with the LOAD menu.
Once the screen starts flashing, you're ready to place your sprites.
        Move the mouse cursor into the map area, and you should see the first
object which was in the file. You start at object #1 and storage location #1.
Pressing the + or - keys will cycle through the loaded objects. This mode
begins with a grid lock on, locking the cursor into locations which match the
16*16 tiles. Pressing G will toggle this grid on and off, allowing placement
with finer detail. To place the object, click a mouse button. The next time
you click, you will place the second sprite, and so on.
	Pressing N will toggle the numerical display mode. If NUMBERS are on,
each object is displayed with its storage location superimposed. This lets
the user know which object is which when deleting. Click on OBJECTS again to
exit this mode.



OBJECT Menu
-----------
	Pressing O will enter the object menu. This displays information for
each of the 1000 objects possible for storage in each map file. The storage
location number you are looking at when you leave this menu will become the
current slot in which to fill. Clicking on NEXT or PREVIOUS will move to a
different storage location. The right mouse button will advance by 5.
Find will search forward or backwards for the first empty storage location
(dependent on left or right FIND button). You may enter values for the various
components manually by clicking on the value you wish to change.
Valid entries are as follows:
      On/Off       -    0 or 1
      World X      -    0 to 5120
      World Y      -    0 to 3200
      Image Number -    1 to 1000

Delete will reset all values for the current storage location to 0.



STATUS WINDOW
-------------
	Pressing S will bring up a status window which shows available memory
and loaded files. Any key or mouse button press will exit this display. XMS
is used in version 1.5 if you have at least 192k available. The program will
crash if you use all available memory, so please keep aware of the amount you
have in use.

                                 CONCLUSION
                                 ----------

    We believe this is the most comprehensive, easy to use, world designer
available for the IBM PC in this graphics mode. Our WGT programming library
follows the same idea. If you wish to use this product, please register.
If you do not have Turbo C++, and wish to know the file formats, we ask that
you register the product, and send us a note asking for the information.

    Sample files are included for you to experiment with, although the SAVE
feature is non-functional. They are to be used as follows:

Traditional arcade:
TILES:  pacman.spr       MAP:  pacman.wmp       OBJECTS:  pac.spr

Side-view scrolling:
TILES:  munchmap.spr     MAP:  munch.wmp        OBJECTS:  munchkin.spr

Overhead-view scrolling:
TILES:  castle.spr       MAP:  castle.wmp       OBJECTS:  guy.spr


You will probably find that we are not artists, but even these simple files
can produce impressive results. Look for our programming kit for Turbo C++
and Sprite Creator with filenames matching WGT*.ZIP.

The order form is included for those who wish to purchase any of our software.
