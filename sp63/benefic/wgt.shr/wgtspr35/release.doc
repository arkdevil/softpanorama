This version is shareware.  This means you can give it to anyone else.
Shareware is not free. If you decide to use this program for your own use,
you must register by filling in the order form and buy a license to use it.
You will receive a registered version with the shareware reminder removed,
and the rights to use it for creating any of your own programs.

 
	This is the third release version of our 256 color sprite editor.
We encourage you to try it out and make any suggestions or criticisms. This
program was created to fill the need for a proper set of tools with which the
'gaming' or graphics programmer can work. This library works ONLY in VGA mode
19 (or 320*200*256). The third version is a slight improvement over the second
version, as it can now load and save CEL files from within the editor.
Version 3.5 allows for loading and saving PCX pics, and loading
GIF pics. It also has a maximum sprite capacity of 1000.


I hope that any ideas you have for the project will be forwarded to me.
I can be reached in the Turbo Pascal or C conferences of NANET,
or on SoftNet BBS in London, Ontario. Full revisions, bug fixes, and comments
or criticisms can be dealt with on SoftNet.
