Executable Program (VCOPY.EXE):

	VCOPY is packaged with a VALIDATE program that will
authenticate the integrity of VCOPY.EXE.  Refer to the
VALIDATE.DOC instructions for the use of the validation program.
     The validation results for 67 should be:
                   SIZE: 37,829
                   DATE: 10-05-1990
    FILE AUTHENTICATION:
        Check Method 1 - E517
        Check Method 2 - 0540

     You may also call the McAfee Associates bulletin board at 408
988 4004 to obtain on-line VCOPY.EXE verification data.  The
VALIDATE program distributed with SCAN may be used to authenticate
all future versions of VCOPY.


Introduction:

	VCOPY is a replacement program for the DOS copy command that
checks for viruses as it copies.  It prevents infected programs
from entering your system and it identifies infected diskettes
during the copy process.  
	VCOPY implements all functions of the DOS 3.3 COPY command,
and uses the identical switches.  Please refer to your DOS users
manual for a full description of the use of the COPY command.
	VCOPY copy will detect all of the viruses detected by the
current version of VIRUSCAN.  It identifies each infected program
or diskette, and names the virus that has infected.  It will also
scan inside programs that have been compressed with LZEXE.
	Please refer to the accompanying VIRLIST.TXT file for an
outline of all of the viruses detected by VCOPY.

NOTE:  VCOPY will perform, on the average, about 10% slower than
the DOS copy command, depending on the mix of files being copied. 
This is because the program must check for viruses while performing
the copy function.  

Operation:
	VCOPY should be placed in your DOS directory or any directory
on the hard disk that is referenced through the PATH command.  If
no path command is specified for your system, then place VCOPY in
your DOS sub-directory and place the following command in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

                   PATH = C:\NAME

	 Where NAME is the name of the DOS subdirectory.


	To run VCOPY type:

        VCOPY [drive:]path1 [drive:][path2] [/E]

        Examples:

        VCOPY A:*.* C:\TEMP

        VCOPY TEST.COM B:

        VCOPY A:*.COM D:\PROG\TEST /E

	The /E option tells VCOPY to check all files that are being
copied, whether or not they are executable.  The default is to
check only executable files, program overlays and the boot
sectors.  These are the only files that viruses can normally attach
themselves to.  
	If VCOPY detects a virus during the copy process, a message
will be displayed indicating the name of the infected file and the
name of the virus that has infected it.  The user will then be
given the option of skipping over the file, or of continuing the
copy process.  If a virus is discovered inside of a self extracting
LZEXE file, VCOPY will tell you that it is an infected self-
extracting program.  It will also tell you whether an infection is
internal or external to such a file.  
	If a virus is discovered, the infected diskette and your hard
disk should be scanned with VIRUSCAN to determine the extent of
infection, if any.  The virus may be removed using the McAfee
Associates CLEAN program.  SCAN and CLEAN are available on most BBS
systems, or they may be obtained from HomeBase at 408 988 3832.

      VCOPY also allows lets you append files, identical to the DOS
copy command.  To do this simply list any number of files, each
separated by a plus sign (+) and then specify a target file to send
the combined files to.  For example:

       VCOPY   FILE1+FILE2+FILE3 SUMFILE

	The standard copy options /A, /V and /B are also supported by
VCOPY.  Please refer to your DOS users manual for a description of
these options.
 
Registration:
	VCOPY is distributed through shareware channels and requires
a $15 registration fee for home or domestic use.  Please reference
the REGISTER.DOC file for registration information.  A site license
is required for corporate or organizational use.  For licensing
information, please contact McAfee Associates at the address or
phone number at the beginning of this document.
