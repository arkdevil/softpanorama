     Beginning with Version 67, there are two executable programs
packaged with VSHIELD.  Either one may be used, but not
simultaneously.
 
     VSHIELD1.EXE (Version 0.1) provides a first level of
protection by checking program validation codes that have been
attached by SCAN.  It will not allow any program to execute if the
validation codes have changed.
     
     VSHIELD.EXE (Version 2.3V67) will scan for specific virus
signatures and identify the virus if one exists in addition to
providing validation code checking.
 

Executable Programs  (VSHIELD.EXE and VSHIELD1.EXE):

     VSHIELD is packaged with a VALIDATE program that will
authenticate the integrity of the executable programs.  Refer to
the VALIDATE.DOC instructions for the use of the validation
program.

The validation results for V67-B should be:

       PROGRAM NAME:     VSHIELD.EXE          VSHIELD1.EXE
               SIZE:     25,971               10,743
               DATE:     10-12-1990           10-04-1990
File Authentication
     CHECK METHOD 1:     8443                 B887
     CHECK METHOD 2:     1A0A                 006C

     You may also call the McAfee Associates bulletin board system
at (408) 988-4004 to obtain on-line VSHIELD.EXE verification data. 
The VALIDATE program distributed with VSHIELD may be used to
authenticate all future versions of VSHIELD.

IMPORTANT:  First place VSHIELD1.EXE and VSHIELD.EXE on a write-
protected diskette prior to installing it.  This will give the user
a valid backup copy in the event that the programs become infected.

Notes on Version 67-B:
	Version 67-B fixes a bug that caused VSHIELD to incorrectly
perform the CRC check on the boot sector and partition table under
some circumstances.

INTRODUCTION and INSTALLATION:

     VSHIELD is a memory resident system that prevents viruses from
infecting your computer.  It provides three levels of protection
that are user-selectable:
  
     I.   Checks CRC validation codes that have been attached by
          the McAfee Associate's SCAN program.  Programs that have
          been altered will not be allowed to execute.

     II.  Checks for virus signatures in memory, the boot sector,
          partition table and and all programs before they are
          executed.  Infected programs will not be allowed to
          execute and VSHIELD will not allow booting from a
          diskette infected with any boot sector or partition table
          virus.

     III. Checks both for viruses signatures and for CRC codes.


Level I:

     Level I protection is provided by the VSHIELD1.EXE program. 
It is a minimal memory resident module that requires 6K of memory. 
VSHIELD1 requires the least amount of system overhead and is the
most non-intrusive approach to protection.
     VSHIELD1 will check the operating system and the CRC values
of all programs before they are allowed to execute.  VSHIELD1 will
optionally check the boot sector and partition table CRC values. 
Any program which no longer matches its CRC value will not be
allowed to execute.
     To implement Level I protection, place VSHIELD1.EXE as the
LAST entry in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  The syntax for the program
is:

          VSHIELD1 /NB  

               /NB is an optional parameter that tells VSHIELD1 not
               to check the boot sector or partition table


Levels II and III:

     Levels II and III are provided by the VSHIELD.EXE program. 
To install VSHIELD.EXE, place the following line as the LAST entry
in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

          VSHIELD /CV /SWAP "pathname" /F "pathname" /NB /NOMEM /X
               
               /CV tells VSHIELD to check CRC values as well as  
                specific virus signatures.  If this option is not 
                selected, VSHIELD will default to level II       
                protection.

               /SWAP is an optional parameter that tells VSHIELD
               to install only its kernel as memory resident.  The
               remaining functions will be swapped in and out of
               memory as needed, from a hard disk or RAM disk.  The
               SWAP paramater may also use an optional pathname to
               specify where the swap file should be kept.  The
               default path is the VSHIELD home directory.
                
               NOTE:  Only use the SWAP parameter if your system
                    has limited free memory space available for  
                    memory-resident programs.  VSHIELD requires 34K
                    in non-swap mode.  With the SWAP parameter set,
                    VSHIELD requires less than 3K of resident
                    memory.

               /F is a required parameter if the SWAP function is
               used on a system running DOS 2.0 or earlier.  The
               /F parameter tell VSHIELD where it has been loaded
               from.  
   
               /NB is an optional parameter that tells VSHIELD not
               to check the boot sector of floppies for viruses on
               reboot.  This option should ONLY be used if the
               reboot check conflicts with other memory resident
               programs or the system BIOS.

               /NOMEM is an optional parameter that tells VSHIELD
               not to perform a memory scan as it loads.

               /X tells VSHIELD to check for extinct viruses.

     Examples:

               VSHIELD /NB
                     To disable boot sector and partition table
                     checking.

               VSHIELD /SWAP  /CV
                     To swap VSHIELD in memory and check validation
                     codes.

               VSHIELD /SWAP D:\PROGRAMS
                     To swap VSHIELD from D:\PROGRAMS subdirectory.

               VSHIELD /SWAP /F C:\
                     To swap VSHIELD on a machine running DOS 2.0.

               VSHIELD /NB /NOMEM /X
                     To disable boot sector and memory checking,
                     and check for extinct viruses.


NOTE:  Do not run VSHIELD.EXE and VSHIELD1.EXE at the same time. 
Select the level of protection you wish to use and install one of
the programs only.


OPERATION:

     When VSHIELD is placed in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, it will
become active each time the system is powered-on or re-booted.  It
will check the critical areas of the system for viruses and then
monitor all program loads.  As programs are loaded, VSHIELD will
scan the programs looking for viruses.  If a virus is found,
VSHIELD will display a warning message for Level I protection
and will name the infection if running Level II or III protection. 
Execution of the infected program will be halted, preventing viral
infection.

     Levels I, II and II will scan specific areas of the system: 
the boot sector, partition table, hidden and system files, command
interpreter, and the VSHIELD executable when VSHIELD is first
executed.  Thus, if the power is turned off and then the system is
booted from an infected floppy (while VSHIELD is not running),
VSHIELD will detect any infection the next time VSHIELD is loaded. 
VSHIELD levels II and III will also prevent boot sector and
partition viruses from entering the system by trapping each
warm-boot request (Ctrl-Alt-Del), and preventing re-boots from
infected diskettes.
  
     VSHIELD version 67 can identify and prevent infection from
141 major virus strains and 220 sub-strains.  The 220 viruses
include the ten most common viruses which account for over 95% of
all reported PC infections.  The complete list (in order of most
recent appearance) is outlined in the accompanying file:
VIRLIST.TXT.  
     In addition, when running VSHIELD in CRC checking mode, it
will prevent unknown viruses from entering the system, provided
that the system files have had the CRC checks added to them by
VIRUSCAN.

     When an infection is identified, the VIRUSCAN non-resident
system scanner should be used to scan the entire system and
determine the extent of the infection.  If you do not have the
VIRUSCAN non-resident program, it may be downloaded from the
HomeBase BBS at 408 988 4004. 


**************************************
MEMORY RESIDENT and NETWORK CONFLICTS:
**************************************

     VSHIELD.EXE or VSHIELD1.EXE should be loaded as the last
entry in the AUTOEXEC file.   It is recommended that VSHIELD.EXE
be used in non-swap mode if memory permits.  Use of the swap option
may increase the chances of conflicts with other memory resident
programs.  If conflicts occur while using the /SWAP option of
VSHIELD, then remove the option and re-boot the system.  If
insufficient memory is available for use of VSHIELD.EXE in non-swap
mode, then it is recommended that Level I protection be implemented
by loading VSHIELD1.
     When running local area networks, be sure that VSHIELD is
loaded AFTER the network drivers on each workstation.  Otherwise,
the program will not properly protect the network.


ERROR LEVELS:
     VSHIELD sets the DOS error level after it becomes resident. 
If it finds a virus in the boot sector, operating system, or itself
prior to going resident, it sets the error level thus:

        No viruses found  - 0
        One or more found - 1
        System Error      - 2


REMOVING VSHIELD:
     VSHIELD.EXE may be removed from memory by issuing the
following command:

               VSHIELD  /REMOVE

     This will de-install the program and remove it from memory. 
If there are other memory resident programs that have hooked the
same interrupts as VSHIELD and which have been loaded after
VSHIELD, it may not be safe to remove the program and VSHIELD will
not de-install.  An error message will be displayed in this
instance.

     VSHIELD1.EXE may not be removed from memory.


SYSTEM OVERHEAD:
     VSHIELD.EXE requires 3K of system memory when used in swap
mode. It requires 34K if used in non-swap mode.  It will add an
average of 4 seconds to each program load, and 6 seconds to each
re-boot.  Swap mode will add an additional 600 milliseconds to each
program load.  After a program has loaded and begun execution,
however, VSHIELD will not degrade the performance or speed of the
system in any way.
     It is recommended that VSHIELD.EXE be used in the non-swap
mode where memory availability permits.
     VSHIELD1.EXE requires 6K of system memory.  It adds an average
of 1 second to each program load.

Virus Removal:

     What do you do if a virus is found?  Well, if you are a
registered VIRUSCAN or VSHIELD user, you may contact McAfee
Associates for free assistance in manually removing the virus.  We
strongly recommend that you get experienced help in dealing with
many of the viruses, particularly partition table and boot sector
infections.  If you are not a registered user, the following steps
should be followed:

     Boot sector infections:
     Power down the system.  Power up and boot from an uninfected,
     write protected floppy.  Execute the DOS SYS command to
     attempt an overwrite of the boot sector.  This works in many
     cases.  If this does not work, backup all data files and
     perform a low level format of the disk.

     Executable file infections:
     Remove all infected files.  Replace from the original
     distribution diskettes.

     Partition table infections:
     Without a removal utility, the only option is to low level
     format the media.

     Disinfecting utilities are available from McAfee Associates
     for the majority of the common viruses.  If you are not a
     registered user of VIRUSCAN, you may purchase these utilities
     from:

                    Version Notes

Version 66:
     Version 66 now prevents infection from 31 new viruses
discovered since version 64.  Please refer to VIRLIST.TXT for a
schematic description of the new viruses.

Version 64:
     Version 64 has been completely re-designed to reduce required
memory and to speed the virus checking process.  VSHIELD now uses
an overlay structure that requires less than 3K of resident memory
space, using the /SWAP parameter, and the processing time has been
reduced by 20%.  All anti-virus functions, including boot virus
protection, have been retained.     

Version 63:
     Version 63 has been one of the most painful versions we have
put together.  There have been 17 new viruses and virus sub-strains
discovered in the 35 days since the release of version 62-B.     
 
     In addition, we've been struggling with the issue of how to
count viruses in a meaningful way that does not place us in a
seemingly disadvantageous competitive position.  For example:
Numerous anti-virus programs advertise the number of viruses that
they are able to block, and these numbers range from less than 50
to over 100.  On analysis, these numbers included all of the known
sub-strains of the viruses, and their virus count by our
classification was always substantially less.  We group viruses by
major type, where possible, to make it easier to manage, both from
an identification and removal basis.  But on a sheer numbers
comparison, VSHIELD appears in a weaker light.  After careful
thought, we decided to stick with our classification scheme, but
in the VIRLIST.TXT we will list the known variants detected in
parentheses.  By the competition's counting scheme, we now block
167 viruses.  By our count, we block 97.   
     The 17 new viruses and new sub-strains added for version 63
have come from a variety of sources.  Vesselin Bontchev from
Bulgaria submitted three new variants of the 512, one new variant
of the W-13 virus and two entirely new viruses that have surfaced
in Eastern Europe.  Dave Chess from IBM provided me with three new
viruses collected through the various IBM contacts.  Patricia
Hoffamn provided one new virus and two new variants submitted from
users of the FidoNet network.  The Icelandic virus researcher
Fridrik Skulason provided one new virus.  The remaining four were
submitted directly by Homebase users.  The VIRLIST.TXT document
describes the main operating characteristics of the new viruses. 
To avoid duplication of effort, I am referring users to Patricia
Hoffman's most current VSUM document for a detailed description of
the new viruses.  This document may be obtained from most bulletin
boards.
