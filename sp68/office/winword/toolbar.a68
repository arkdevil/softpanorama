
PROBLEM: Every time you change the settings in menus or add icons to the
toolbar, you have to select Tools, Options.

SOLUTION: Double-click on any space in the Toolbar to bring up the
Options dialog box. This defaults to the Toolbar category, but you can
simply scroll to other categories to set their options.
