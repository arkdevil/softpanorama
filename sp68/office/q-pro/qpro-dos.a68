Quattro Pro for DOS

PROBLEM: You've worked your way down into a sticky maze of submenus and
you need to back out quickly.

SOLUTION: Instead of repeatedly pressing Esc, or Q for Quit, just hit
Ctrl-Break. This undocumented feature works as an industrial-strength Esc
key, instantly shooting you back to the main menu.
