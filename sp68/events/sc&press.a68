                   ***************************


On 26 November at the end of the second European Week for Scientific 
Culture, journalists and researchers will meet at CERN to discuss 
the coverage of science in the Media. This conference will be 
addressed by top editors, journalists, scientists and politicians.

To avoid polite but fruitless theorizing, we would like to have the 
points of view of as many scientists as possible. Can you help us by
answering some questions?
Your first reaction being the most valuable, use Dylan's constant 
(Don't think twice, it's all right). If you have colleagues with 
strong feelings on the subject, kindly forward them the 
questionnaire, to be e-mailed back by November 10 to 
Science.Press@cern.ch .

For more info contact Neil_Calder@macmail.cern.ch

To answer, just write an X before your choice (multiple answers
allowed); on open questions, start writing on the line of the open 
selection. Then, send back the edited text to Science.Press@cern.ch .
