V1.01e Change Log

Fixes 

1.	ZipStream: Close handle bug, traps, hangs and redirection errors.
2.	ZSPack,ZSUnpack,ZipStream: Preserve file date time attibutes
3.  Force case of directories to be upper case, compatible with other
	file systems.
4.  Correct search instance memory reallocation problem.
5.  Stopped switching from name to position search instances. Instances
	are now always position based.
6.  Correct negative seek calc problem.
7.  Correct potential race condition on close of compressed file.
8.  Differenciate seek limits for DOS and OS2 programs.
9.  Correct DIR listing problem with 4OS2

Improvements:

1. Delay background compression thread wakeup when very busy.
2. Reduce file lock time on delayed compression thread.
3. Improvements to cache logic on file searches.

V1.01i Change Log

Fixes :

1.  Correct problem with access to files on a HPFS partition from a DOS
    session.
	Map filenames to upper case under controlled conditions.

2.  Some users have reported hangs at system startup. We believe this 
    may be due to an internal race in OS/2 on access to the system .INI
    files. Our beta testers, and other users have not reported this 
    problem, but to be on the safe side, we have dropped usage of the 
    OS/2 .INI files.
