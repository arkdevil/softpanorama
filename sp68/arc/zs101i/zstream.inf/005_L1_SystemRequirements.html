If you are capable of running OS/2 2.1 or higher, you can take advantage
of ZipStream.

In case you're still unsure, ZipStream has the following requirements: <!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<B>Recommendations</B>
<P>
ZipStream excels on 486's with 16 MB of RAM, and for that matter, so does
OS/2 2.1.
<P>
ZipStream has been designed to take advantage of 486 (and better) CPU's,
and ZipStreams large sparse virtual memory management system performs best
when there is plenty of RAM.
<P>
The benefit of these recommendations is that ZipStream gives access performance
to compressed files as if they were not compressed.  For example, after
a small initial access delay to game files, games will play with no noticeable
degradation in performance.
<P>

<P>
<B>Swap File Requirements</B>
<P>
ZipStream is designed to give fast access to files by trying to keep as
many of the current set of files decompressed in memory as possible (Note:
ZipStream's behaviour is highly configurable in this area).
<P>
On systems with low amounts of RAM, ZipStream will utilise Swap Space to
keep uncompressed information available for ready access. More memory means
less Swap requirements and faster access. More files being concurrently
accessed, means more Memory requirements.
<P>
Of course, the Swap Space requirements are easily reclaimed MANY times over
by keeping your files compressed with ZipStream.
