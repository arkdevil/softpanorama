<P>
In most cases ZipStream is completely compatible with all games that can
be run by OS/2.
<P>
Normally there will be a small delay as the games are started, but then
as the game files are virtualised, performance should return to normal or
may actually improve.
<P>
If a game is very slow to load or is suffering performance problems then
try recompressing the files with the Warp 7 option e.g.
<P>
  zsunpack *.*
<P>
  zspack -w7 *.*
<P>
This option will in most cases remove any performance problems, but will
tend to increase the Swapper file space requirements.
