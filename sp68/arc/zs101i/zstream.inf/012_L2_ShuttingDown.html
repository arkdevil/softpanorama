<P>
<B>NEVER JUST TURN YOUR SYSTEM OFF</B> 
<P>
Always shut your system down from the Desktop.
<P>
By shutting down from the Desktop you will ensure that:<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> Any new or altered files that were being compressed
in the background will be compressed and saved before the system is stopped.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> ZipStream is shutdown correctly
which in turn will ensure that any changed configuration information is
preserved.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL> ZipStream is
idle at shutdown, ensuring the most reliable operation of your system.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
During the shutdown process, ZipStream will display an Information Window
informing you that it is shutting down.
<P>
If there are remaining compression jobs outstanding, the window will show
a count of the jobs and will update this counter until all jobs have been
completed.
<P>

<P>
<B>Using Ctrl-Alt-Del</B>
<P>
We recommend strongly that this method of shutdown is used only when OS/2
fails to shutdown in the normal manner, or for some reason the Desktop is
no longer accessible.
<P>
ZipStream will sense this event and close all open files and abort any operations
that may have been in progress, before allowing the system to stop.
<P>
This ensures the safe and reliable operation of your system.
<P>

<P>
<B>Note: </B> Using Ctrl-Alt-Del may cause files that were queued to be
compressed to remain uncompressed, however no damage to the files should
occur.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
