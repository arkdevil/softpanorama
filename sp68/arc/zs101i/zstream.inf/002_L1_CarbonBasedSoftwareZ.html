<B>What is ZipStream ?</B> 
<P>

<P>
ZipStream is a new concept in automatic file compression, that harnesses
the power and features of OS/2 2.X.
<P>

<P>
ZipStream is an OS/2 2.X Installable File System (IFS) that mirrors access
to existing OS/2 File Systems, and simultaneously provides automatic transparent
file compression and decompression. 
<P>
To further understand the ZipStream concept, consider the following scenario.
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>

<P>
You have an existing OS/2 system with the file<I> letter.doc</I> in the
root directory of the C:\ drive.  ZipStream is installed and drive C:\ is
mirrored as compressed drive X:\ (this is achieved using the <A HREF="015_L2_ZSAttach.html">ZSAttach
</A>utility as follows:-<B> zsattach x: c:\</B>).
<P>
Access to all files on drive C:\ is now possible simultaneously via drive
X:\.
<P>
i.e. The commands<I> type C:\letter.doc.</I> and<I> type X:\letter.doc</I> will
achieve the same results.
<P>

<P>
Now<I> letter.doc</I> is compressed with the ZipStream file compression
utility ZSPack as follows:-<B> zspack c:\letter.doc</B>.  Typically, a text
file like<I> letter.doc</I> will be reduced in size by at least 50 percent.
 Compression ratios of around 80 percent can generally be expected on large
text files.
<P>
Access via<I> C:\letter.doc</I> will reveal its compressed contents, but
access via<I> X:\letter.doc</I> will allow access as if the file is uncompressed.
 That is, ZipStream recognises that the file is compressed and transparently
decompresses it. <!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
