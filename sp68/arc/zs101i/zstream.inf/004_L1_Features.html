<UL>
<P>
<B>High Performance Multi Threaded Design</B><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
ZipStream exploits OS/2's pre-emptive multi threaded processing capabilities,
to give you outstanding performance in automatic file compression.
<P>
ZipStream utilises OS/2's multi thread features for read-ahead, write-behind,
and priority based compression processing.
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL><B>Advanced and Reliable Object
Orientated 32 bit Implementation</B><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
ZipStream uses state of the art Object Orientated design techniques to ensure
safe and reliable operation.
<P>
Its 32 bit implementation allows for complex processing to be carried out
in the most optimum manner, while coexisting harmoniously with OS/2 2.X
as a native 32 bit application.
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL><B>Compatible with, and Exploitation
of OS/2s' HPFS and Advanced FAT File Systems</B><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
ZipStream uses existing OS/2 File Systems, and has been specially optimised
to operate these file systems in the most efficient manner (e.g. ZipStream
is aware of, and takes advantage of the HPFS caching strategy).
<P>
By utilising existing OS/2 File Systems, no container files are necessary,
thus giving you very high confidence in the File Systems integrity.
<P>
Additionally, compressed files can be easily transported to other systems
in compressed format by simply referencing them via the host drive letter.

<P>

</UL><B>File</B><I> Name</I><B> and
</B><I>Size</I><B> Sensitive Compression Algorithm Selection</B><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
ZipStream, being a file system, has intimate knowledge of a files' parameters,
and as such, can apply optimum algorithms on a per file basis. e.g. ZipStream
applies different caching strategies depending on the file size, and may
also apply different compression algorithms depending on the file name and
contents.
<P>
Additionally, ZipStream treats each file on an individual file basis. Therefore,
every file may be processed with different compression options and parameters
as specified by the user. This allows great flexibility in the management
of your system. e.g. Infrequently accessed files may have maximum compression
applied at a slightly greater cost in access time, while frequently accessed
files may have less compression applied, thus increasing access performance.

<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL><B>Large Sparse Virtual Memory
Utilisation</B><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
ZipStream utilises OS/2's powerful 32 bit Flat Memory System to<!-- entering slot 5 --> keep
entire files uncompressed in memory.
<P>
This Virtual Memory File capability allows performance sensitive applications
such as games etc, near instant access to uncompressed data.
<P>
Note: Some small initial access delays will occur as the game (application
etc) is started (while the uncompressed file is virtualised).
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL><B>In-situ Compression (No Container
Files)</B><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
ZipStream uses in-situ compression. That is, the file being compressed is
replaced in the standard file system with a compressed version. It can then
be referenced via a ZipStream drive as uncompressed data again, or it can
be inter-actively uncompressed again with a ZipStream utility.
<P>
This means that compressed files may be easily transported in compressed
format, and additionally, you don't have the usual worries of container
files suddenly becoming corrupt.
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL><B>Configuration and Compression
Options that Cater for the Most Demanding Environments</B><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
ZipStream provides a variety of compression options and configuration settings,
so it can be tailored to your particular needs and expectations.
<P>
Compression options are configurable on a per file basis, allowing you the
greatest possible flexibility.
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 --> <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL><B>Network Capable with ZERO
File Server Overhead</B><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
ZipStream is fully capable of providing compression operations on network
paths.
<P>
This is achieved on the work-station side of the network. This means that
files can be stored compressed on a File Server and then accessed as uncompressed
at the work-station.
<P>
The real bonus is that there is ZERO Server overhead (the Server does not
have to do the compression or decompression), and since the Server will
be processing less data (as it is compressed), the server performance may
actually increase.
<P>
Note: A licensed copy of ZipStream must be on all work-stations that wish
to access compressed data.
<P>
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->  <!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL><B>Zero Write and Create Overhead.
</B><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>
<P>
ZipStream imparts ZERO overhead on file create and write operations, as
the compression operation is relegated to a write behind thread running
at low background priority.
<P>
Apart from the immediate benefit of completely removing any compression
overhead, is the fact that ZipStream can now spend longer on the actual
compression operation. As a result, the big payoff is higher compression
ratios than can be obtained by other systems because their synchronous operation
must sacrifice compression in order to maintain performance.
