Once you have installed ZipStream, you can begin to take advantage of it
at your own pace.
<P>
One of the best ways to start is to compress files that you use infrequently,
as this will more than likely free up a lot of space quickly. Most of us
tend to horde old applications (and big games) etc just in case, and that's
why you are now using an automatic compression program.
<P>
To begin with, use the ZSAttach utility to provide mirrored access to your
C drive as say the H drive. You enter at the command prompt:
<P>
  zsattach h: c:\
<P>
Now all the files that you can access via the C drive are accessible via
the H drive.
<P>
You could have specified a more specific path to ZSAttach, such as
<P>
  zsattach h: c:\games
<P>
but, to begin with, we recommend complete drive mirroring to keep things
straight forward and simple.
<P>
As a quick experiment, execute the following command (now that you have
C mirrored as H).
<P>
  zspack c:\readme
<P>
Now the OS/2 readme file is compressed. You can view it again by executing
the command
<P>
  type h:\readme
<P>

<P>
At your own pace start compressing more files and in the future reference
them again via drive h:
<P>
Any new applications etc you load or any new files you create on drive h:
will be automatically compressed.
