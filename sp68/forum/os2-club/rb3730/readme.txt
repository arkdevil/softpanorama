Notes on Control Program Redbook Examples
=========================================

MEMLAB1:

  Demonstrates the use of the new
  DosAllocMem API, and the handling
  of General Protection Exceptions.

MEMLAB2:

  Demonstrates the different types
  of memory allocation.

MEMLAB3:

  Demonstrates multiple DOS sessions
  started from a OS/2 program, and
  to show how the size of the swap
  file varies as the sessions are
  started and what happens to the swap
  file after the sessions are stopped.

MEMLAB4:

  Demonstrates the new system
  limit for the number of threads
  per process in OS/2 2.0 and the
  effect of thread creation on the
  growth of SWAPPER.DAT.

SWAPSIZE:

  To be used with the Lab Session
  Examples given in Appendix C of the
  OS/2 Version 2.0 Volume 1: Control
  Program Document no GG24-3730.
  This program interrogates and
  displays the size of the
  SWAPPER.DAT at regular intervals
  in a PM window. The interval is
  initially set to 10 seconds. This
  may be changed to 30 seconds or
  60 seconds by selecting the
  Interval action bar.
