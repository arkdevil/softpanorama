Results of various machines, as mailed to me through Internet.
I'd like to thank all who sent me their experiences. I'm not publishing 
the addresses because:

1. Didn't ask permission, some may be "private" since they are from businesses.
2. Space concerns. 

The details of the machines are as detailed as the information provided to me!
