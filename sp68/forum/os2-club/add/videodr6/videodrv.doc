          DOCUMENTATION FOR VIDEO DRIVER INSTALL v6.00
          ---------------------------------------------
          (c)1994, Dr. A. Olowofoyeku


INTRODUCTION
------------

Please read the "LIMITATIONS" and "DISCLAIMER" sections at the end of this
file BEFORE using VIDEODRV.

While it is possible for OS/2 users to use different video display drivers
for their seamless and full screen Win-OS/2 sessions, the OS/2 installation
and DSPINSTL programs always identical drivers for both sessions. While this
may be fine for some people, many OS/2 users have optimized Windows drivers
that they would like to use for their full screen Win-OS/2 sessions. The
process of changing the video display drivers for full screen Win-OS/2
sessions has normally been tedious, involving fiddling around with INI
files.

VideoDrv is a program that greatly simplifies this process - just type in
the name of your new full screen driver, or select one from a listbox, then
click on a button, and the rest is done automatically. The whole process
takes no more than 5 seconds. In short, VIDEODRV works as a Win-OS/2
replacement for the SETUP program that comes with Windows 3.1.


********
FEATURES
********

1. VIDEODRV will optionally install your display driver directly
   from your driver/distribution disk, unpacking and decompressing them (if
   necessary) in the process. In this respect, it simulates the SETUP
   program that comes with Windows 3.1. To use this feature, select the menu
   option "INSTALL NEW DRIVER FROM DISK". You will then be prompted for the
   directory in which your driver files are to be found (this will normally
   be a floppy disk drive into which your driver disk has been inserted, or
   if you have copied the files to the hard disk, then the subdirectory on
   the hard disk where the files may be found).

   VIDEODRV will then read the OEMSETUP.INF file that comes with your driver
   disk and decompress the drivers to your Win-OS/2 system directory. Some
   OEMSETUP.INF files may not be readily readable (and I only have access to 
   a finite number of OEMSETUP files). If there is any problem with your
   manufacturer's version of the file, do please mail me a copy.

   NOTE that if you downloaded your drivers from a bulletin board or from an
   ftp site, you need to unzip the files first. VIDEODRV will NOT unzip files
   that have been archived in the ZIP format.


2. When you have installed your drivers from a driver disk, VIDEODRV will
   create a file in your DRIVER DIRECTORY (see below) called VIDEODRV.DBF.
   This file will hold information on all the drivers that you have
   installed through VIDEODRV from a driver disk. Thus, if you want to
   change the drivers, you will be presented with a list of the descriptions
   of the drivers (not just the file names as in early versions of
   VIDEODRV). When you select from the list, the appropriate driver will be
   installed.

   Please NEVER delete VIDEODRV.DBF, otherwise, VIDEODRV will just assume
   that you have not installed any driver from a driver disk as described
   above, and will only present you with a list of driver filenames.

3. VIDEODRV will put a copy of each installed driver into your DRIVER
   DIRECTORY. This is to facilitate future driver changes.


4. There is a menu option which you can select to RESTART the Win-OS/2
   session. Also, when you have just changed your display driver or
   installed a new one, VIDEODRV can optionally restart the Win-OS/2
   session. You should use this option only if you are already running in a
   full screen session.


***************************
** NEW WITH VERSION 5.00 **
***************************

5. Well, there is yet a new file format for VIDEODRV.DBF. Actually, it is
   just the same old file format, but I have added yet more information to
   the file, as I add new features internally. Thus, there is a new 
   CONVERT.EXE which converts VIDEODRV.DBF from the version 4.00 format
   to the version 5.00 format. Please note that you should only use the
   CONVERT.EXE that is supplied with version 5.00 if you are using version
   4.00. If you are using an earlier version (assuming you have not been
   using it for more than the 30 day evaluation period) then you basically
   need to delete your VIDEODRV.DBF file, and reinstall your drivers files
   again for the purpose of building a new VIDEODRV.DBF.

   CONVERT.EXE is text mode OS/2 program that should be run from a command prompt
   (after changing to the directory in which your VIDEODRV.DBF file is located).

   CONVERT.EXE is really a half-way solution, because the information in the
   old DBF file is less than that in the new file. All that CONVERT.EXE does
   is to put that information into the new file format. By using it, you
   will not get the benefits of the extra information in the new file format
   (this basically concerns updating references to fonts in the Win-OS/2 INI
   files). Please note this point.

   CONVERT.EXE converts the data in VIDEODRV.DBF and puts it into a file
   called CONVERT.DBF. After conversion, you need to back up your old
   VIDEODRV.DBF, delete the copy on your hard disk, and then rename
   CONVERT.DBF to VIDEODRV.DBF.


***************************
** NEW WITH VERSION 6.00 **
***************************

6. The program now tries to detect whether the installed version of OS/2 is
   the full version, or OS/2 for Windows, and re-arranges things accordingly.
   This is only a minor update, and does not deserve a full numerical increment
   in the version number. However, there is no other way of ensuring that the
   ZIP file is named appropriately.


INSTALLATION
------------

There is no special installation procedures. Just copy the following files;
1. VIDEODRV.EXE     (the executable)
2. VIDEODRV.INI     (the initialization file)
3. VIDEODRV.DOC     (this file)
4. LZEXPAND.DLL     (library file for decompressing driver files)
                    - you may already have LZEXPAND.DLL in your Win-OS/2
                      system directory. If so, then you do not need to copy
                      the version supplied with this program.

into any sub-directory. Then create a WPS object for VIDEODRV.EXE, or add it
to one of your Program Manager groups.


USE
---

Please read the DISCLAIMER at the end of this file BEFORE any attempt to use
VideoDrv.

As indicated above, VIDEODRV will now unpack driver files directly from a
manufacturer's driver distribution diskette, or from any directory into
which the driver files have been copied.

In order to run VIDEODRV properly, I recommend strongly, that;

  [a] you should create a special DRIVER DIRECTORY into which your full
      screen Win-OS/2 drivers will always be installed.

        e.g., C:\DRIVERS

  [b] the name of that directory should be placed on the line
      "DRIVER-DIRECTORY=" in the file VIDEODRV.INI. This is actually the
      only entry in this INI file, and should be used.

       e.g., DRIVER-DIRECTORY=C:\DRIVERS

  [c] all the drivers that may be used for full screen Win-OS/2 sessions
      should be copied into the driver directory. This is done automatically
      when you use VIDEODRV to install drivers.

  [d] click on the button labelled "Browse", or the button labelled
      "List .DRV files, to get a list of the driver files in this directory,
      from which one can be selected.

  If there is no entry on the "DRIVER-DIRECTORY=" line (in VIDEODRV.INI), or
  if a non-existent directory is specified, then VideoDrv will always
  default to your Win-OS/2's SYSTEM directory. The problem with this
  approach is that there are *many* files in the Win-OS/2 SYSTEM directory
  that have the extension ".DRV". Most of them are NOT video display drivers
  at all, and some of the ones which are video display drivers are not
  suitable for full screen Win-OS/2 sessions (typically, the ones used for
  seamless Win-OS/2). Thus, selecting any of these will lead to
  unpredictable results.

  This is why it is *highly recommended* that all your special Windows
  screen drivers should be placed or copied into a separate directory. When
  any of them is selected from the list, VideoDrv will copy it from this
  directory into your Win-OS/2 SYSTEM directory, so that Win-OS/2 can find
  it when loading.


CHANGING VIDEO DISPLAY DRIVERS
------------------------------
To change your full screen driver, select "New display driver" from the
"File" menu. This leads to a dialog box which asks for the details of the
new video display driver. This dialog box displays the NAME of the CURRENT
full screen display driver, and any DESCRIPTION for it that exists in the
INI files. The cursor is placed in an edit field into which you type the
name of the new driver.

NOTE:
-----
1. If you are sure that the driver already exists in the Win-OS/2 SYSTEM
   directory, you can just type its name into this field. NOTE that only the
   name of the file is to be typed in here. There should be no directory
   path, or anything else.

   For example, "ET4000.DRV" is acceptable, if that file exists in the
   Win-OS/2 SYSTEM directory. However, "C:\OS2\MDOS\WINOS2\WIN31\ET4000.DRV"
   is NOT acceptable. In any case, VideoDrv will not allow more than 12
   characters in this field.

   After typing the name of the driver, if you want to type in a description
   for that driver, click on the next edit field, and type your description
   there. This description is optional. However, if you do type in a 
   description here, then VIDEODRV will add this to the entries in the file
   VIDEODRV.DBF in your driver directory. If no description is typed in,
   no entry will be made for the driver in VIDEODRV.DBF.


2. If you are not sure whether the driver is in the Win-OS/2 SYSTEM
   directory or not, or if you wish to select a driver from a list, then
   click on the "List .DRV Files" button. Then select the required driver
   from the list of DRV files. The name of the driver you selected will
   appear in the edit field, and the cursor will be moved to the next field,
   into which you can type in a description for the new driver. This is
   optional.

   If you have used VIDEODRV to install driver files from your driver
   disk, then you can click on the "Browse" button. This will show you
   a list of drivers that you have installed in this way (a full decription
   of the drivers), and then you can select one of them.


3. When everything is complete, click on the button labelled "Write the
   changes", and the new driver is installed for you full screen Win-OS/2.
   It will take effect when you next run a full screen Win-OS/2 session.
   At this point you will be asked if you want VIDEODRV to RESTART Win-OS/2
   to see the results of your new driver. If you are running a full screen
   Win-OS/2 session, you should click on the "YES" button. If you are running
   a seamless session, then you should click on "NO", and start a full screen
   session manually.



DESCRIPTION OF MENU OPTIONS
---------------------------

1. CHANGE DISPLAY DRIVER
   ---------------------
   Choose this option to replace your current full screen driver with another
   one to be selected from the driver files in your DRIVER-DIRECTORY. When
   this option is selected, a dialog box appears. You can either type in the
   name of the driver file you want, or click on one of the buttons for
   assistance. The buttons on this dialog box are;
       [a] BROWSE - this will open the file VIDEODRV.DBF and present you with
                    a list of the drivers that you have installed from a
                    driver disk. What you get here is a full description of
                    the drivers. There are appropriate error messages if the
                    file is not found, etc.

                    When you double click on one of the drivers in the list,
                    the approprate driver file name is transferred into the
                    edit field, and then you have to click on the button
                    labelled "Write the changes".

       [b] LIST .DRV FILES - this presents you with just a list of the files
                    with a .DRV extension. You can then select a file from
                    the list. When this is done, the filename gets
                    transferred to the edit field, and then you have to
                    click on the button labelled "Write the changes".


       [c] ABANDON - abandon the installation process.

       [d] WRITE THE CHANGES - writes whatever is in the edit fields into the
                    appropriate INI files. If the field for the driver name
                    is empty, then you will get an error message.


2. INSTALL NEW DRIVER FROM DISK
   ----------------------------
   Select this option when you want to unpack your drivers from your driver
   disk. You will be prompted for the directory in which the files from the
   distribution disk can be found. Then the file OEMSETUP.INF will be read
   for the installation information. After this, there will appear a list
   box containing descriptions of the drivers found on the disk. You can then
   double click on any of them to unpack and install them in one go.


3. SHELL TO DOS
   ------------
   This option opens a DOS box. It is useful for the purpose of maybe
   unzipping files, etc. Type "exit" to close the DOS box.


4. RESTART WIN-OS/2 SESSION
   ------------------------
   This option closes down the current Win-OS/2 session, and RESTARTS the
   session again. You will be prompted for confirmation. You should use this
   option only if you are already running in a full screen session.


5. QUIT WIN-OS/2 SESSION
   ---------------------
   This option closes down the current Win-OS/2 session. You will be
   prompted for confirmation.


LIMITATIONS
-----------
VIDEODRV has developed the proverbial "middle-age spread" since version
1.00. As I have added features to it, the more the program has grown in
size. I do not wish it to grow any further, and there are many things I have
decided not to implement.

1. The first is installing from multiple floppy disks. If all the files
  relating to your driver are on one floppy disk, then that is fine. If they
  span a number of floppy disks, then you need to copy all the files into a
  directory on your hard disk and install from there.

2. Some OEMSETUP.INF files prefer certain fonts to be copied from the
   Microsoft Windows 3.1 distribution disks. VIDEODRV will not copy these
   font files, since my main purpose in writing it is to enable OS/2 users
   to install their video drivers WITHOUT using MS-Windows at all. If people
   have MS-Windows 3.1, then they can run its SETUP program instead.

   Usually, these fonts would have been copied to your MS-Windows 3.1 system
   anyway, if you have actually installed MS-Windows 3.1. They are mainly
   fixed monospaced fonts.

   If you want to be doubly sure, you can;

   [a] copy all the files with a .FON extension from your MS-Windows 3.1
       distribution disks into a directory on your hard disk, and then
   [b] copy the files from your manufacturer's driver distribution disk into
       the same directory AFTERWARDS (this way you won't overwrite your
       manufacturer's fonts with MS ones that have the same name), and then
   [c] install your drivers from this directory.

   This method will work because VIDEODRV will try to install all the fonts
   that your OEMSETUP.INF file tells it to. It will ONLY look for these
   fonts in the directory from which you are installing, and if it doesn't
   find any font, it simply goes on with the rest.
