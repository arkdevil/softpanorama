UPDATE NOTICE
-------------
This is an updated version of SEAMWIN v2.00. Some people have
reported errors with certain types of video card. I hope that
this version can cure some of those problems. It is still
basically the same program as seamwin2.exe, but there are minor
changes which are designed hopefully to solve some of the problems
some people are having.
