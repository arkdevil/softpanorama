          DOCUMENTATION FOR SEAMWIN v1.00
          --------------------------------
          By Dr. A. Olowofoyeku


INTRODUCTION
------------
OS/2 users who run seamless Windows program will have noticed that
when one seamless program is already running, others which are run
in the same VDM (this is the default for seamless Windows) load
extremely quickly. What some users have done is to keep one of their
favourite Windows programs loaded all the time. This is fine, but
with OS/2, memory should always be conserved. Enter SEAMWIN, a full
Windows program that does absolutely nothing. It is simply a shell
to be used to speed up seamless Windows, by leaving it running all
the time.

USE
---
To use SEAMWIN, copy the file SEAMWIN.EXE into a directory on your
hard disk, then create a WPS object for it, and then place this
object in your STARTUP folder. This means that it will be loaded when
OS/2 is booted. This adds a few seconds to your bootup process, but
then you can just forget it. Try loading seamless Windows programs,
and see how fast they load. That's all, folks.

Note that when seamless Windows programs are run in the same VDM, the
settings for the first one to be loaded seem to apply to all the rest as
well. So, whatever settings you want to have for the Windows programs
in the VDM created by loading SEAMWIN at startup should be in the
notebook settings in the WPS object created for SEAMWIN.EXE.
