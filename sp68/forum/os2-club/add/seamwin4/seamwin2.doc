          DOCUMENTATION FOR SEAMWIN v2.00
          --------------------------------
          By Dr. A. Olowofoyeku


UPDATE NOTICE
-------------
This is an "optimized" version of SEAMWIN v1.00. All the Windows
resources;
      [a] the menu
      [b] the dialog box
      [c] the icon

have been stripped out of this version, and the program also becomes
INACTIVE once loaded, meaning that the memory space used by it not
only becomes free, but the system also knows that this program will not
become active again, and so it can be ignored completely. This results
in ZERO cpu cycles, and better performance. I have stripped out every
thing that can possibly be stripped out of this program.
