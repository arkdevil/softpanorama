OS/2 New User Introduction
==========================

[Revised: August 20, 1994]

Welcome to the world of OS/2!  IBM OS/2 2.11 is an inexpensive, full-
featured, DOS- and Windows-compatible operating system for 386SX (or
better) PC compatibles.  It is quite powerful (supporting long
filenames, REXX programs, Adobe Type Manager and TrueType, a 32-bit
flat memory model, preemptive multitasking, multithreading, advanced
multimedia including software motion video, and robust communications,
for example), yet its Workplace Shell user interface makes it
remarkably easy to use (and amazingly flexible).

This brief document is intended to help you get started using the
Internet's OS/2 newsgroups and to help you obtain more information on
OS/2.  Read it carefully to get started with this exciting operating
system.  It will be posted regularly to the OS/2 newsgroups which new
users are most likely to visit.


Where Can I Get OS/2?
---------------------

In the United States, IBM OS/2 Version 2.11 is available from almost
any software dealer, including Egghead, Software Etc., CompUSA,
Babbage's, and many others.  (Below Zero, Indelible Blue, and other
vendors listed in the OS/2 FAQ List -- see below -- will handle both
U.S. and international mail orders for the U.S. English version.)  It
is also available directly from IBM through the OS/2 Hotline at (800)
3-IBM-OS2.  You may also call the OS/2 Hotline if you would like OS/2
product literature, videotapes, books, t-shirts, and special discounts
on popular OS/2 applications.

There are three OS/2 packages available.  Choose OS/2 2.11 full version
if you do not have either DOS or a previous version of OS/2.  Choose
OS/2 2.11 Upgrade Edition (under $100 from most software dealers) if
you are upgrading from DOS or a previous version of OS/2, you do not
have Windows 3.1, and you want Windows application compatibility.
Choose OS/2 for Windows (under $50 from most dealers) if you already
have Windows 3.1 (or if you don't have Windows but do not need Windows
application compatibility).

All three packages are available in your choice of 3.5 inch, 5.25
inch, or CD-ROM media.  If you purchase the diskette version of OS/2,
be sure to buy the diskette size that corresponds to your Drive A.
(Like DOS, you must boot OS/2 to install it.)  Before purchasing the
CD-ROM version, check with the OS/2 FAQ List (see below) to make sure
your CD-ROM drive and adapter combination are supported by OS/2 (the
vast majority now are).  (The FAQ List also includes purchase
suggestions if you do not yet own a CD-ROM drive.)

Note that OS/2 2.11 (at least when purchased directly from IBM in the
United States) has a 30 day, no questions asked, money back guarantee.
You can try OS/2 risk free and return it for a full refund if not
completely satisfied.

Please see the OS/2 Frequently Asked Questions List for further
information on OS/2 pricing, availability, and hardware requirements.

Note  
----

Although the latest version of OS/2 is 2.11, 2.11 is just a bug fix (a set of
Corrective Service Disks) above 2.1.  The CSD can be obtained either from IBM
or by ftping it from software.watson.ibm.com.  
Also, version 3.0 of OS/2 is due to be released in mid-October, it may be
worth waiting for it before purchasing OS/2.


OS/2 Frequently Asked Questions List
------------------------------------

The OS/2 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) List is a compendium of
useful OS/2 information.  It should be your first stop whenever you
have an OS/2 question.  Before you post a question to any OS/2
newsgroup, please check the FAQ List to see if it is already answered.
The first few sections of the OS/2 FAQ List are particularly helpful to
those who have never seen or used OS/2 before.

To obtain the OS/2 Frequently Asked Questions List, you may use "ftp."
The ftp command (available on most systems connected to the Internet)
allows you to retrieve files from other systems on the network.  The
exact procedure may be different on your system, but you should try
the following command:

ftp ftp-os2.cdrom.com

(Press ENTER or RETURN after each command.)  When asked for a
username, type:

anonymous

and when asked for a password, simply type your Internet mail address.
Then, type the command:

cd /pub/os2/all/info/faq

to change the directory.  To get a list of files in that directory,
type:

dir

Identify the file with the "highest" number.  (As of this writing, the
latest OS/2 FAQ List is Release 2.1E, filename faq21e.zip.)  To
retrieve this file, type the following commands:

binary
get faq21e.zip

The FAQ List package will then be placed in your home directory on
your home system.  You can then download the file to your DOS or OS/2
machine.  This file is "zipped," as many OS/2 program files are.  You
need an UnZip utility to decode the file (and extract the files
contained in the package).  Versions of UnZip are available for many
systems, including DOS, Unix, and OS/2.  (The OS/2 version of UnZip is
located in directory /pub/os2/all/archivers on that same ftp system.  
Multiplatform source code is also located there.)

The ftp-os2.cdrom.com site is one of the Internet's largest
repositories for OS/2 software and information.  For more information
on ftp-os2.cdrom.com, consult the ASCII (text) file /pub/os2/0readme
at that site.  For a directory of OS/2 files available at
ftp-os2.cdrom.com, retrieve the ASCII file /pub/os2/00index.txt.

If you need more help in either retrieving a file using ftp or in
UnZipping the file, ask your system administrator.

To end your ftp session, type:

quit

and you will be disconnected.

If you cannot use ftp, you may retrieve the FAQ List by mail from an
ftp mail server.  Ask your system administrator (or consult the
newsgroup news.answers) for advice.  The OS/2 FAQ List is also
available from several online services, including CompuServe, and many
bulletin board systems (BBSes).  The OS/2 Shareware BBS
(+1-703-385-4325) and Greater Chicago Online (+1-708-895-4042) always
carry the latest version.

The List is now also available through Gopher.  Your host may have the
Gopher client software installed.  Try entering the command:

gopher

to see if it works.  If it does, you should navigate through the menus
to connect to the IBM Almaden Research Center experimental Gopher
server in California (or connect directly to index.almaden.ibm.com).
Once you have located that server, select "OS/2 Information," "Non-IBM
Originated Files," then download the OS/2 FAQ List.

Also, the FAQ is avalible via World Wide Web (WWW).  If you have a WWW Client
(such as Mosaic or Lynx) installed, you should be able to get it at:
http://www.mit.edu:8001/activities/os2/os2world.html

The newsgroup news.answers contains several help files, posted
periodically, which can assist you in using ftp, mail, Gopher, and
LISTSERV systems.  You may wish to consult these information files
before asking your system administrator for assistance.


OS/2 Newsgroups

After reading the OS/2 FAQ List you may have some unanswered
questions.  If so, you may post a message to one of the OS/2

just one newsgroup.

Free Real Time Technical Support and OS/2 Discussion
----------------------------------------------------

If your host has an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client installed, it is
poosible to get free help with installing, or any other problems by joining
the OS/2 channel.  Although the people in the channel are not IBM technical
support, they can be very helpful.  To see if you have an IRC client, try
typing:

irc

at the command line, and see if it works.  To join the OS/2 channel, type:

/join #os/2

Aside from Techincal Support, IRC is also a good place to get information,
rumours, and tips about OS/2.  


Reporting Problems to IBM
-------------------------

If you have an OS/2 problem you may contact IBM directly.  Consult the
OS/2 FAQ List for details on OS/2 technical support (through
CompuServe, to CompuServe from the Internet, or by telephone).
