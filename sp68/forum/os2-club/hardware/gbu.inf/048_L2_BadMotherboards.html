<UL>Very unstable from day one.  Manufacturer support
was poor (they refused to call me back, said it was OS/2 and not their board,
would not provide RMA for return of Board for them to test; even after I
offered to pay for the testing and shipping to and from, etc).  Continous
Trap 000D, 000E, and 0002 when I was able to even get it to load.  Used
built-in controllers, even worse.  Used 3 different video boards, 2 different
HDD/FDD boards, 8 differnt HDD, 4 different FDD, 3 different CPUs, 8 different
SIMMs (56Meg, same manufacturer, one of their reccomeded ones and Part #),
etc.  The only thing I didn't change was the MB itself (even changed the
cache).  Spent 4 months on this board, over 225 reloads before giving up
(PC mag gave this board a #1 reccomendation).  Fair Docs
<P>
P.S.  ALL of the hardware used works fine on another MB and my current MB!
 Some of the problems I am sure are also attributable to the BIOS and not
the MB.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<UL> When,
for the short time periods, it was running it ran like a champ (Better than
the AIR I currently use). Fast, clean, crisp.  REALLY wish this board worked.
