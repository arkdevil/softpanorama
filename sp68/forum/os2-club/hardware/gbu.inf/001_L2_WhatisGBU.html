What is GBU?

<P>
It is no secret that many people have had less than wonderful experiences
getting OS/2 to work with sub-standard computer hardware.  This document
is an attempt to minimize these problems in the future.  It can be used
as a shopping list, or to compare against your machine to find if other
people using the same hardware have had similar problems.
<P>
As is the case with any document of this type, it can only be helpful if
it is supported by the potential users.  This means that enough people must
send in enough messages that a representative sample of the available hardware
gets listed.  Please email <A HREF="082_L0_.html">me</A> new submissions.
 New versions will be posted as additions are made to the list.
<P>
Feel free to upload this document to any ftp site, BBS, or online service
that does not already have it, or that has an older version of it.
