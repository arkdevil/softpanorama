<UL> OS/2
recognizes it's there, but thinks it's a 2.88MB floppy drive.  I've been
unable to get it to work better, but haven't tried too hard, either.
<P>
[Rumor has it that drivers do exist on ftp-os2.cdrom.com in /pub/os2/2_1/patches
as 21optcl.zip.  Could someone who has this drive please investigate and
send <A HREF="082_L0_.html">me</A> email? - ed.]<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
