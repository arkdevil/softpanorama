Usenet Announcement
<P>
----
<P>
Since many of the problems people have had with OS/2 stem from semi-compatible
PC hardware, I will maintain a live document of computer hardware with respect
to its performance with OS/2.  I will make this document available by uploading
it to BBSs and ftp-os2.cdrom.com.  It will be distributed both as a viewable
INF file and as clear text.
<P>
The working name of the file is "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly". "GBU"
for short.
<P>
Please send me messages about any hardware experiences you want to share.
 In particular I am looking for information on motherboards, video cards,
multi-I/O cards, SCSI controllers, floppy drives, hard drives, CD-ROM drives,
printers, modems, mice, track balls, graphics tablets, multi-serial port
cards, and any other hardware you have had good, bad, or ugly experiences
with.
<P>
The definitions I am using are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>GOOD</B><!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL> hardware that caused no known problems,
software drivers were available in shrink wrap either with OS/2 or with
the hardware, or drivers were freely available on BBSs.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> BAD
</B><!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL>hardware that has proved to be incompatible
with OS/2 due to excessive numbers of trap messages, or OS/2 drivers do
not exist.  The hardware might still work in DOS or Windows sessions with
appropriate drivers.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> UGLY</B><!-- lm: 0x11 3 -->
<UL> hardware
that has had problems which could be corrected only after some serious work
(changing jumpers doesn't qualify as serious), the available drivers take
advantage of only some of the features of the hardware, only beta level
(or worse) drivers exist, or the hardware works only in a "compatibility
mode".  If there are several messages with conflicting votes for a piece
of hardware, it will automatically be placed in this category.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
The specific information I need includes:  type of hardware (mother board,
video card, etc.), the manufacturer, model number, chip set, serial number
range (if it matters), and a vote on Good, Bad, or Ugly, with a specific
problem report or glowing recommendation, and any caveats regarding the
GBU vote.
<P>
I may change the GBU designation based on the comments or caveats if they
point to a different designation using the guidelines above.
<P>
If you wish to refute a previous category for a piece of hardware, please
provide adequate documentation that the hardware should change from one
category to another.  It is almost impossible to promote something from
Bad to Good directly without said hardware spending at least one release
of GBU in Ugly.  Likewise for the opposite (less likely) demotion.
<P>
Please send messages directly to me via Internet or the networked IBM BBS
based in Canada.  On the (Canada) IBM BBS, send messages to<B> John<!-- entering slot 3 --> Altstadt</B>.
 Private messages may be sent via the<B> Ibm.Bbsmsg</B> forum or uploaded
as files with a note to the sysop to forward the file to me.  On Internet,
send messages to<B> altstadt@mprgate.mpr.ca</B>.
<P>
To reduce the time required to generate a new edition of GBU, I prefer that
messages are sent to me in <A DEPENDENT GROUP=3 HREF="003_L2_IPFSourceFormatExamp.html"><!-- extra bytes: 00 06 03 00 -->IPF
format</A>, as I can just cut &amp; paste them into the source files, and
then bang out a new version quickly.  If this is a problem for you, then
send them in <A DEPENDENT GROUP=3 HREF="004_L2_ASCIISourceFormatExa.html"><!-- extra bytes: 00 06 03 00 -->ASCII
format</A> and I will do the appropriate conversion.  These panels show
example text that you would be replacing highlighted this way.
<P>
Not all fields will make sense for all hardware categories.
<P>
The examples given are for hardware that does not exist.
<P>
