The San Diego OS/2 User Group has participated in the San Diego Computer
Fair in which over 18,000 people attended over a three day weekend last
September.  This group has started an OS/2 newsletter with the goal of providing
information to not only OS/2 users but also to others who are interested
in learning more.  Our aim is to also develop the newsletter so that it
becomes a community effort among the OS/2 user groups and SIGs.
<P>
Past meeting topics have included presentations by IBM's Ultimedia for OS/2;
Lotus demonstrating beta versions of 1-2-3 and Freelance Graphics for OS/2;
an introduction to REXX, demo of the December OS/2 2.1 beta along with Visual
REXX; Eddie Miller, one of the authors of "OS/2 2.1 Unleashed" sharing insights
into the OS/2 mini-applets; and, local OS/2 developer Jeannine Wolf discussing
the OS/2 Config.SYS file and providing tips.
