<P>
One of the most useful features of IPF is it's text manipulation capabilities.
Without these abilities, we'd only be able to present nice windows of drab
looking text. How boring! Fortunately, with the following information and
a little creativity, you can make your text jump out to the reader.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
<UL>
<P>
Highlighted phrases<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
These are the quickest and simplest tags to use to change the way your text
looks. The tags are in the form :hp<I>n</I>.<B>highlighted text</B>:hp<I>n
</I>, where<I> n</I>  is a number between 1 and 9.
<P>
For example, the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL> :hp1.Highlighted phrase
1 is italic:ehp1.
<BR>
:hp2.Highlighted phrase 2 is bold:ehp2.
<BR>
:hp3.Highlighted phrase 3 is bold-italic:ehp3.
<BR>
:hp4.Highlighted phrase 4 is blue:ehp4.
<BR>
:hp5.Highlighted phrase 5 is underlined:ehp5.
<BR>
:hp6.Highlighted phrase 6 is underlined-talic:ehp6.
<BR>
:hp7.Highlighted phrase 7 is underlined-bold:ehp7.
<BR>
:hp8.Highlighted phrase 8 is red:ehp8.
<BR>
:hp9.Highlighted phrase 9 is magenta:ehp9.
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL>produces text that looks like this:
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL><I>Highlighted phrase 1 is italic</I>
<BR>
<B>Highlighted phrase 2 is bold</B>
<BR>
<B><I>Highlighted phrase 3 is bold-italic</B></I>
<BR>
Highlighted phrase 4 is blue
<BR>
Highlighted phrase 5 is underlined
<BR>
<U>Highlighted phrase 6 is underlined-talic</U>
<BR>
<U><I>Highlighted phrase 7 is underlined-bold</I></U>
<BR>
Highlighted phrase 8 is red
<BR>
Highlighted phrase 9 is magenta
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL>You cannot nest highlighted phrase<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Color
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
While highlighted phrase let you change the color of the text to one of
3 colors, the color tag let's you change the foreground and backgound colors
of your text. the tag has the form :color.  and must include one or both
of the following attributes:<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<P>
fc=<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> changes the foreground color.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
</UL>bc=<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> changes the background color.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL>The choices for both foreground and background
colors are: blue, cyan, green, neutral, red, default, and yellow. 
<P>
Some example tags:<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL> :color fc=cyan.Here's some lovely
cyan text.: colorfc = redbc = green . Here ' ssomeredongreen .
<BR>
:color fc=yellow bc=blue.Here's some yellow on blue.
<BR>
:color fc=default bc=red.Here's the default foreground on red.
<BR>
:color bc=default.And now both foreground and background are back to defaults.
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL>and their output:
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL>Here's some lovely cyan text.
<BR>
Here's some red on green.
<BR>
Here's some yellow on blue.
<BR>
Here's the default foreground on red.
<BR>
And now both foreground and background are back to defaults.
<BR>
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL>There is no end tag for a color tag. The colors
assigned remain in effect until the end of the current window they are assigned
in. To change everything back to normal, simply use :color fc=default bc=default.
 <!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Fonts<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
The :font. tag allows you to change the font that your text is displayed
in. It has two attributes:<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<P>
facename=<!-- lm: 0x2 27 -->
<UL> changes the font to the name specified.
There are four possible fonts to choose from: Courier, Helv, 'Tms Rmn',
and default (spelling and punctuation for each must be as shown). Facename
is<I> always</I> a required attribute.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
</UL>size=<I>h</I> x<I> w</I><!-- lm: 0x2 27 -->
<UL> changes the height
and width (in<B> points</B>) of the font. If size given is invalid for the
font, IPF will choose the nearest match. Size is a required attribute when
<B>facename</B> is anything other than default.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL>There are four possible fonts that may be used,
as this example shows: :font facename=Courier size=12x12.Courier:font facename=default.:
fontfacename = Helvsize = 12x12 . Helv : fontfacename = default .
<BR>
:font facename='Tms Rmn' size=12x12.'Tms Rmn':font facename=default.
<BR>
:font facename=default size=12x12.default:font facename=default.
<BR>
 <!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>Margins<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
Margins are helpful in organinzing various sections of text, as this very
window shows. There are two margin tags: :lm margin=<I>n</I> and :rm margin=<I>n</I>,
which control left and right margins, respectively.<I> N</I> is the value
of the margin to be assigned. Assigned margins don't take effect until a
tag is used that enters a line feed.<B> :p.</B> is used most often. The
assigned margins remain in effect until either changed or the end of the
current window is<!-- entering slot 12 --> reached.
<P>
For example, the following:
<P>
:lm margin=25.:rm margin=10.
<BR>
:p.
<BR>
This text has the left margin set at 25 and the right margin set at 10.
As you can see, the text is automatically justified between the two margins.

<BR>
:lm margin=10.:rm margin=25.
<BR>
:p.
<BR>
This text has been set exactly opposite, with the left margin set at 10
and the right margin set at 25. Once again everything's justified to fit
the margins.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
looks something like this:<!-- lm: 0x2 25 -->
<UL>
<P>
This text has the left margin set at 25 and the right margin set at 10.
As you can see, the text is automatically justified between the two margins.
<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
</UL>This text has been set exactly opposite, with the
left margin set at 10 and the right margin set at 25. Once again everything's
justified to fit the margins.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Lines
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
Normally the text in an IPF window is dynamically justified. Rather than
having the text scroll of the side of the window, IPF makes sure it all
fits. Try making this window narrower and you'll see what I mean.
<P>
Sometimes, however, you have some text that only makes sense if the appears
as it is formatted in the source file. The :lines. tag allows you to display
lines in IPF just as they appear in your source file. There is only one
attribute:<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<P>
align=<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> allows you to select the alignment of the
text. May be left, right, or center. If not specified, text is aligned to
the left.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL>The end tag is :elines.
<P>
For example: :lines align=left.This text is aligned to the left.:elines.
<P>
:lines align=center.This text is centered.:elines.
<BR>

<P>
:lines align=right.This text is aligned to the right.:elines.
<BR>

<P>
ouputs: This text is aligned to the left.
<P>
This text is centered.
<P>
This text is aligned to the right.
