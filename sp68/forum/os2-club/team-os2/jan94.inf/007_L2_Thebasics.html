<!-- entering slot 7 -->Tags<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
A tag begins with a colon (:) immediately followed by the tag name and ends
with a period (.). For example, the tag for a new paragraph is:
<P>
:p.
<P>
Some tags have one or more<B> attributes</B>, additional fields inside the
tag (after the tag name but before the period) that give more information
about the tag's operation. For example, to set the foreground color to red
using the<B> color</B> tag, you would enter:
<P>
:color fc=red.
<P>
Some tags have only one possible attribute, others have several attributes.
Also, sometimes an attribute is optional. For instance, the tag to start
a simple list has only one possible attribute,<I> compact</I>. If not specified,
there will be a blank line between each item in the list. If specified,
each item will be on it's own line with no blank lines between it and any
of the other items.
<P>
Some tags also require an<B> end tag</B>. An end tag starts with an<B> e
</B>followed by the original tag name. For example, a simple list requires
an end tag to tell the compiler when it's reached the end of the list:
<P>
:esl.
<P>
Some tags are known as<B> nested tags</B>. These tags appear in between
other tags. An example of this the list item, or<B> :li.</B>, tag. it is
used with the various list tags to specify a new item in the list. An example
using<B> attributes, nested tags,</B> and<B> end tags</B> looks something
like this: :sl compact.
<BR>
:li. first nested tag
<BR>
:li. second nested tag
<BR>
:li. third nested tag
<BR>
:esl.

</UL>Symbols<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
There are also specialized tags called<I> symbols</I> that begin with an
ampersand (&amp;) and end with a period (.). Symbols let you display most
of the extended ASCII character set, such as the box drawing characters.

<P>
Symbols also let you display some normal ASCII punctuation characters. For
instance, since all tags begin with a colon, how do you put a colon in some
text so it doesn't trick the IPF compiler into thinking it's another tag?
Use the<B> &amp;colon.</B> symbol! OK, since all symbols start with an ampersand,
how do you keep that compiler from confusing single ampersands with symbols?
Use the<B> &amp;amp.</B> symbol!
<P>
There are around 140 symbols available in IPF, which is too many to list
here. The only two that I've found absolutely necessary are the colon and
ampersand symbols for the reasons mentioned above.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
You can create the IPF source file with any text editing tool, so long as
you save it as ASCII text.
<P>
Each line of the source file may be no longer than 255 characters. If any
line is longer, the compiler will give an error message.
<P>
You may have more than one IPF source file as well. Using the<B> .im</B> directive
allows you to imbed additional IPF files at compile time. The<B> .im</B> directive
must appear on it's own line in the first column of the source file. For
example, you can include the file SOMEFILE.IPF in your document by putting
the following line in:
<P>
.im SOMEFILE.IPF
<P>
This allows you to break a large document into smaller more manageable files,
then compile them into one document by imbedding them in a single master
file.
<P>
According to the IPF manual, each file is also limited to a 64K file size
as well, but I've had no problem compiling files &gt;100K.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Using
the IPF compiler<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
The IPF compiler, IPFC.EXE, is a relatively<!-- entering slot 8 --> straight-forward
affair. Simply enter IPFC.EXE, the name of your source file, and the /INF
parameter. The /INF parameter tells the compiler you want a stand alone
.INF file since the compiler produces .HLP files by default. For example:

<P>
IPFC Example.IPF /INF
<P>
This will produce the file Example.INF.
