Happy New Year!
<P>
From all indications the OS/2 market is catching fire.  I hope it is getting
warm out there where you are.  It certainly is here in our neck of the woods.
 Intuit (Quicken) is taking suggestions for a native OS/2 version (I hope
they make one).  I would like to thank the OS/2 User Group Support team.
 Our members have benefited from the information that is provided about
OS/2 vendors and authors. Our Xmas party was a lot of fun.  Even though
Santa had some costume problems. &lt;RBG&gt;  Next year we will be holding
our Xmas party in Jefferson City.  We have some really good speakers lined
up for the first quarter.  I have also been working with the OS/2 Users
Group in K.C. to try and syncronize our guest speakers to give more incentive
for our guest speakers in terms of hitting two user group in the same area
within two days.  Hopefully this will show up in the second quarter of '94.
 Oh, I almost forgot.  For those of you who are thinking of doing your own
taxes.  Check out Tax Dollars '93.  This is an OS/2 Tax preparation software
package.  The planning version is on the OS/2 Woodmeister (TDPLAN.ZIP).
 The package lists for $19.95 and User Group members get a $5.00 discount.

<P>
May all of your programs pre-emptively multitask.

Peace.
