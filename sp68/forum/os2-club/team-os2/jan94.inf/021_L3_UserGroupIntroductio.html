<P>
We try to list known OS/2 User Groups whenever we get the information. Of
course, we can't be responsible if the information proves to be unreliable
-- you, the reader are our best source of this information.
<P>
And we're learning of more and more OS/2 user groups across the country
and even around the world every week.  It's been slow, but we have made
some contacts and we may be able to exchange information and articles in
the future.  If you're travelling and have some free time, stop in on one
these meetings.  If you know of another OS/2 user group, drop us a line
and we'll mention them.  Remember, we'll list them all in the INF file each
time.  And thanks!
