PCX has released version 1.07 of OS/2 BakupWiz. This is a minor bug fix
and enhancement release. See the list of changes/fixes at the end of this
message.
<P>
Our customers may obtain the release in one of several ways. The complete
replacement for the release code is available on PCX's BBS now. You must
be a registered user on the BBS in order to gain access to the private area
where the archive is located. If you are not setup on the BBS already, please
call us and we will take care of that for you. The file name is BWS5-107.ZIP.

<P>
A quicker and easier way is for you to download a patch file that will update
your existing product to the 1.07 level. You gain by having a smaller download
to perform and having the patch available on both our BBS and Compuserve.
The patch is only useful to customers with the 1.06 code! If you are running
older code, you must first bring it up to the 1.06 level. In addition, since
it is safe for us to post the patch in a public forum, you do not need to
be validated on our BBS before you are able to download it. The file name
for the patch on Compuserve is BWP6-7.ZIP and is found in the OS2BVEN forum
LIB 2. On our BBS, the filename is the same.
<P>
The patch is easy to apply. Unzip the patch into the directory where you
have OS/2 BakupWiz installed. Then just go into that directory and type
PATCH.
<P>
Please call us if you have any problems.
