<UL>
<P>
It is necessary to tell the IPF compiler the the file it is processing is
in fact an IPF document. The :userdoc. tag does just this. You must also
end your document with the :euserdoc. tag to tell the compiler when it's
reached the end of the document.
<P>
Next you can give the title of the document with the :title. tag. Simply
follow the tag with the name of the document, and it will appear at the
top of the main window when VIEWing the document. For example:
<P>
:title.An example IPF file<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL> Headings (aka windows)
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<UL>
<P>
An IPF document may have up to six levels of headings. Headings are the
lines of text that appear in the Table of Contents window when you first
VIEW a document. The ones initially displayed are<B> first level</B> headings.
If a first level tag has a plus next to it, then there is a<B> second level
</B>heading "under" the first level heading, and so forth.<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="008_L2_Startingout_1.gif" WIDTH=0 HEIGHT=0 ALIGN=center>
<P>
As you probably know, double-clicking on a heading in the Table of Contents
opens another window, so it's easy to think of defining headings as defining
new windows for the reader of your document.
<P>
Headings are defined using the :h1.  thru :h6.  tags. The heading tags have
quite a few possible attributes. For simplicity here, we will only be discussing
a few important ones.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<UL><!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
<P>
res=xxx<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> where xxx is a number between 1 and 64000,
and each window must have a unique number. The number is reference to the
window defined by the heading tag. This number is used by link tags in order
to select other windows. <!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
</UL> group=xxx<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> where
xxx is a number between 1 and 64000. The number assigns the window to a
particular group. When you select a window with a group number to display,
IPF searches all open windows for a window with the same group number. If
no match is found, the new window is opened. If the group number is matched
with an open window with the same group number, the current window is<I> replaced
</I>with the new window. Group numbers are useful in keeping the clutter
of open windows to a minimum. <!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
</UL> x=<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> x
may be assigned one of the following values: center | left | right. This
attribute defines what the window's postition will be in regard to the parent
(main IPF) window. It will only be noticable to use this attribute with
the height/width attributes below. <!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
</UL> y=<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> y
may be assigned one of the following values: center | top | bottom. This
attribute defines what the window's postition will be in regard to the parent
window. It will only be noticable to use this attribute with the height/width
attributes below. <!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
</UL> width=xx%<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> where
xx is percentage up to 100. Defines the windows width relative to the parent
window. <!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
</UL> height=xx%<!-- lm: 0x2 26 -->
<UL> where
xx is percentage up to 100. Defines the windows height relative to the parent
window.<!-- lm: 0x2 10 -->
</UL> <!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="008_L2_Startingout_2.gif" WIDTH=0 HEIGHT=0 ALIGN=center>Figure
taken from IPF manual.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL> While these attributes are
helpful, none are necessary to create a simple window. For example:
<P>
:h1.A very simple window
<P>
This creates a first level heading in the Table of Contents window. For
something more interesting, you could try chenging it to:
<P>
:h1 x=left y=top width=75% height=75%.A slightly more interesting window

<P>
This creates a window in a position of our choosing. Now let's try making
a second level heading. It's quite simple:
<P>
:h2 x=right y=bottom width=75% height=75%.Another slightly more interesting
window
<P>
This creates a second level heading in the Table of Contents beneath the
previous first level heading. Since we haven't been putting group numbers
in these headings, we can only see one window at a time. Let's add some
group numbers to the last two example headings so we can see both at the
same time:
<P>
:h1 group=1 x=left y=top width=75% height=75%.Another window
<P>
:h2 group=2 x=right y=bottom width=75% height=75%.A window you can see at
the same time
<P>
Now, when the<I> Another window</I> is displayed, selecting<I> A window
you can see at the same time</I> will display it at the same time.
<P>
So far I haven't discussed what to do with<B> res=</B>. It's<!-- entering slot 10 --> rather
unnecessary at this point. Later, when we discuss<B> links</B>, we'll see
just how important<B> res</B> numbers can be.
