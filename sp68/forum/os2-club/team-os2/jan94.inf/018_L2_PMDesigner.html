PM Designer version 1.0 -&gt; VacNat Software Announces &lt;-
<BR>
PM Designer version 1.0
<BR>
A Visual C++ application design tool for
<BR>
OS/2 Presentation Manager
<BR>

<P>
PM Designer(PMD) is a visual programming tool for OS/2 PM and C++ that takes
the drudgery out of writing Presentation Manager applications. It can reduce
the time it takes to write a functional PM application from days to hours
or minutes. The idea behind PMD is to allow the fastest possible transition
from "Hey, what if i had an app that..." to "Okay, that's what it looks
like.", without having to actually write a program, compile it, and run
it first.
<P>
PMD integrates your other tools, acting as kind of a bridge between the
resource-creation and coding stages of your application's development.
<P>
Building a PM application complete with a status bar, toolbar, dialog boxes,
a menu, etc., is a simple "point and click" process. First, use your resource
editor to create the dialog, bitmap, and menu resources that will appear
in your application. Now start PMD. Press the "Design" button, RMB click
on the design window, press a few  buttons, and you're on your way. Specify
the files your resources are in, and their names, and they appear on the
window as they would in a "live" application. Select items on these resources,
for example an item on a menu, and PMD allows you to "link" that item to
another resource or action, such as opening a specific dialog box, running
another application, opening a system-defined dialog box, or simply inserting
a section of  your own source code.
<P>
PMD supports the generation of singlethread as well as multithreaded applications,
applications with dialog boxes as their main windows, and generates makefiles,
support code in header files, .RC files, and attractively formatted, highly
organized C++ source code. The resultant programs are compact and fast.
Unlike most other visual programming environments, no massive runtime DLLs
are required, and of course, there is no runtime royalty fee.
<P>
The layout of the source files facilitates easy modification and maintenance,
because instead of the traditional giant switch statement in the window
procedure, PMD's standard code generator creates a tiny "event procedure"
for each message you want the application's window to receive, and one for
each menu item, toolbar button, or pushbutton in your application. The global
data in your application  is stored in the window words for each window,
and a single source module is generated to support each window or dialog
box in your application.
<P>
PMD also has a "test" mode that allows you to view the application as it
would look and behave after it's built and compiled.
<P>
After you finish the design phase of your application, you enter "Build"
mode, and press "Go" to generate the source files. seconds later, the files
appear in a listbox, and from there, you can<!-- entering slot 23 --> load
them into your favorite editor, or press the "Procedures" button to see
a  list of the procedures in the file, and edit them, one by one, with the
integrated procedure editor. This editor, designed especially for this  purpose,
features a toolbar, and context-sensitive online help on any of the  PMDAPI
functions(explained later in this document), and, if you have the OS/2 Toolkit,
help on any of the OS/2 API functions. (This editor is a subset of the standalone
text editor that ships with the full version of PMD.)
<P>
The resultant source files can be regenerated after you edit them without
destroying the work you've already done.
<P>
<U><I>PMDAPI functions and macros</I></U>
<BR>
PMD includes a large set of helpful functions and macros to help reduce
 the "noise level" in your code. These APIs are documented in an online
reference.
<P>
<U><I>Skeleton Files</I></U>
<BR>
PMD uses a set of template, or "skeleton" files to control how it generates
source code. These files are essentially source files that contain special
variables and flags to tell the code generator what to do, so it's a simple
matter to customize PMD to suit your own needs.
<P>
<U><I>Alternate code generators</I></U>
<BR>
PMD makes use of "plug-in" DLLs to generate source code. This allows the
use of any number of different code generators, for any purpose. Suppose
you want PMD to generate Pascal code. The standard code generator doesn't
work for that, but one could be built that does. IBM's class library? not
a problem. zApp? doable. Your own class library? just ask. Windows code?
If you must. More code generators are under development, and will be available
shortly.  If we don't have one that you need, the API for writing your own
DLLs is  available. Contact us at one of the addresses below for more information.

<P>
<U><I>Pricing and Availability</I></U>
<BR>
PMD is available via mail order at a price of $45, which includes shipping
and handling. This includes PMD's design environment, the code generator,
 the PMDAPI header file set, the online reference information, the  text
editor, the skeleton files, example programs, an icon and bitmap library,
the necessary .LIB files, and technical support through CompuServe, and
VacNat's own BBS. See the address below for details on where to send your
order.
<P>
<U><I>System Requirements</I></U>
<BR>
PMD does not include a compiler, .RC editor, or the OS/2 header files. You
will have to supply these. a package such as Borland C++ for OS/2 will work
nicely, as will any other package that includes a C++ compiler, and the
OS/2 Toolkit. PMD requires approx. 2 MB of disk space, and a  minimum of
8MB of ram is recommended. A mouse is also highly recommended.
<P>
<U><I>How to see a Demo</I></U>
<BR>
To see a demonstration of PMD and what it does, how it works, etc., a demo
can be downloaded from CompuServe in the OS2DF1,<!-- entering slot 24 --> BCPPWIN,
or OS2USER forums. It is also available on the OS/2 Shareware BBS(703-385-4325),
 Silver Lake BBS(206-743-3489), or VacNat's own BBS, at 913-764-5958.  More
BBSes as they are discovered and uploaded to. This is a smaller version
of PMD so that you can download it with less expense(in case the BBS is
long-distance) but it includes example programs, a  fully functional copy
of PMD's design environment, and the documentation. It also includes an
order form.
<P>
It is also available for FREQ at 1:280/304.
