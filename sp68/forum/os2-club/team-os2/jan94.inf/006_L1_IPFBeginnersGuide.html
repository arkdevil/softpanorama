A lot of people have asked how I create monthly MMOUG newsletters, so this
month I've put together the first of two articles detailing what I do. This
month I'll talk about the OS/2 tools I use to create the .INF file you read
and next month I'll detail the steps I take in creating the newsletter,
from scanning the internet and Fidonet, to "pasting" it up, and finally
compiling it to get the finished product.
<P>
At the heart of creating the MMOUG newsletter is the Information Presentation
Facility, or IPF. IPF is a tagged format language that allows you to format
text and graphics, and define how a reader may see and access that information.

<P>
All that's needed to create an IPF document is the IBM IPF Compiler (IPFC.EXE)
and a text editor (I use E.EXE). You can find the compiler in the Developer's
Toolkit, as well as other third party development tools such as Borland
C++ for OS/2.
<P>
The hardest part about using IPF is learning all the various tags to format
your text and define where and how your text appears. So, I've broken things
down into 6 sections that describe some of the more frequently encountered
IPF tags, starting with what exactly a tag is, and leading up to links and
graphics. <A DEPENDENT HREF="007_L2_Thebasics.html"><!-- extra bytes: 00 02 -->The

I've included the IPF file for this guide to help understand what's covered:
IPFguide.IPF  which contains the IPF code used to create this guide. I've
also included the IPF file for the newsletter itself, however I haven't
included the additional bitmap and IPF files used to create the newsletter,
so it can't be compiled.
