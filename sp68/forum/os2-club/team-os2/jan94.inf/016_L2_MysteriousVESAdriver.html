Subj: OS/2's VESA is a blessing...
<P>
In the OS/2 2.1 base there is an MSDOS program; /OS2/MDOS/VESA.EXE. This
program lacks documentation, both in the online documentation and hardcopy
manuals.  But what VESA does is when run, fiddles with the standard 256k
VGA card to deliver 640x400x256 resolution!  Yup, on bog standard VGA!  Basically,
OS/2's VESA.EXE means some of us can delay buying an SVGA card just a little
longer.
<P>
Strange this is VESA.EXE doesn't particularly care what OS it is run under.
 I run it under raw DOS for the same results.  A buddy tried to run it on
his PC and it bombed.  Weird.  I have a PS/2, but an old one with boring
VGA (from the old pre-IBM PC Corporation spin-off days).
<P>
Does anyone know what this puppy is?
