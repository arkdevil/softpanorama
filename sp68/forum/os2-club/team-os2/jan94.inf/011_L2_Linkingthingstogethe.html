<P>
Links allow the reader of an IPF document much quicker access to information.
With a simple point and click, the reader is able to call up other windows
contained in the document.
<P>
The link tag is used do this: :link.. There are quite a few attributes for
the link tag, though some are too advanced for us to worry about right now.
The tags I think are most relevant:<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
<P>
reftype=<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> can be assigned one of four values:<B> hd,
fn, launch,</B> and<B> inform</B>.<B> hd</B> tells the compiler that we're
creating a link to a heading, and this is only value you'll need to worry
about until you've become a more advanced IPF writer (I still haven't used
any of the other values).<B> fn</B> specifies a link to a footnote, and
<B>launch</B> and<B> inform</B> are used to launch PM programs and send
messages to PM programs. Please refer to the IPF manual for more info on
how to use these attributes.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL> res=<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> when
<B>reftype=hd</B>, you must use this attribute to give the res number assigned
to the heading you are going to link to. Remember how I said res numbers
weren't impostant yet when I was talking about headings? Well now they are
<I>very</I> important. In order to point to a heading you must assign that
heading a res number.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL> auto<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> a
link tag with this attribute is automatically opened everytime the window
the link is in is opened.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL> dependent<!-- lm: 0x2 20 -->
<UL> when
this attribute is specified the window opened by the link is dependent on
the window the link appears in. That is, if a window is opened by a dependent
link, and the window where the link appears is closed, the window created
by the link is closed also.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL>
<P>
Link tags usually have an end tag (:elink.), but when the<B> auto</B> attribute
is specified it becomes unneeded.
<P>
Without the<B> auto</B> attribute, the text that the reader will actually
click on come between the<B> link</B> and<B> elink</B> tags. When the<B> auto
</B>is specified, there is no text for the link since the link will always
be opened automatically.
<P>
Simple link:
<P>
:link reftype=hd res=123.Click here for more info:elink.
<P>
An automatic link:
<P>
:link reftype=hd res=123 auto.
<P>
A dependent link:
<P>
:link reftype=hd res=123 dependent.Click here for more info:elink.
<P>
An auto and dependent link:
<P>
:link reftype=hd res=123 auto dependent.
