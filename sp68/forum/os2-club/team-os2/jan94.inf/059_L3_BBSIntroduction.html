Well, I am trying to update this file in an expedient way so it doesn't
become too stale when I include it in the INF version.  But I'm trying to
catch up on a backlog.  I've got the list in an Rbase for OS/2 database
file right now, so all I need to do is figure out a way to create a report
that does much of my INF coding for me.
<P>
Next month, I'd look for a few more additions. And by all means keep Dave
Fisher posted on your BBS's if he's still keeping his list up and current.
Without him, we wouldn't be able to include as much as we do.
<P>
This listing is for the BBS junkie in you who needs to have a phone bill
treat once in a while &lt;G&gt;.  Or bored to death while you're travelling.

<P>
Our listing is based on a rather extensive listing put together by Dave
Fisher of OS/2 type Bulletin Boards.  Space limits this month prevent us
from listing all the details he has for each BBS, but we've tried to include
a couple from every state in the US (Notice and hint to you sysops...not
all states are represented.) and a few foreign countries, too.
<P>
Dave Fisher's list is a compilation of OS/2 BBS's across the world.  If
you wish to make an addition or correction to his list, he's asked that
you please netmail your BBS information to Dave Fisher at LiveNet, 1:170/110@fidonet.org.

<P>
For the newsletter, I've sorted the in alphabetical order by Country for
the international ones and by state for those in the USA to make it easier
to find one close to you.  His file has other details related to these BBS's
but we didn't have room, okay?  The file we're using showed that the last
update was September 7, 1992.
<P>
Does anyone know if this list of his is being kept up to date?  I hope to
expand it more next month; ran out of time.  But I've got his list in a
database right now and I'll be able to code that list a lot easier next
month.
<P>
Hope you find this inclusion useful.  Large phone bills are not my fault...!!!
