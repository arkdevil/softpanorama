Here's a bit of humor on Microsoft and it's habit of getting it's hands
into all parts of the industry. For the humor impaired, this is a very fictitious
press release. :).

Subj: Microsoft Climbs into the Driver's Seat

Microsoft Climbs into the Driver's seat
<P>

November 26th, Redmond WA - Marketing representatives from Microsoft Corporation
 today announced  the Company's  new line of  high-value sedans signaling
the Corporation's move into automobiles.  Said Bill Gates,  Microsoft  CEO,
 "We feel that consumers are confused by the great variety of  vehicles
out there.  Every  company offers its own proprietary  version of your  basic
sedan,  but there's no standard, and we intend to change that."
<P>
Microsoft aims to  define that  standard with their new  Redmond(TM) sedan.
 The company claims that given the  advanced set of state-of- the-art  features
in the new model,  the Redmond  sedan could be the best  vehicle  available
 in a  short period  of time.  The  Redmond features include:<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->

o<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>Room for  up to six  passengers,  although the  current
version only allows one occupant while the car is in motion.  Microsoft
claims  that  this  will  provide  greater  security  for  the passenger
and  vows to  introduce a true  multi-passenger model in Q3.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>Integrated
car phone.  The "Redmond" includes  a Sony(TM) model TCP-93. This model
only allows dialing out, so another phone is required if you wish to receive
calls or communicate with other satisfied "Redmond" owners.  Microsoft expects
that many third- party vendors will be glad to provide this added value.
<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>Revolutionary  cache strategy
 allowed  Microsoft to design  the "Redmond" with just 3 wheels instead
of four. Microsoft predicts tremendous savings in tire replacement.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>No
speedometer, odometer, or gas gause. Microsoft stated that it can deliver
a higher-quality product by leaving off these frills in the  initial offering.
 Industry analists  suggest this could also provide jobs for an enterprising
third party marked.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>An early
 prototype of the "Redmond"  (code-named "Pong") had an obvious  disadvantage
 of  only  supporting  left  turns.   The production-ready "Redmond" instead
offers  revolutionary control preserving but control-insensitive steering.
The steering column and  directional<!-- entering slot 18 --> signals  allow
you to turn in either direction, and  while  the car  "remembers"  the direction
 you turned,  it translates this  into a left turn  automatically. "This
is great news for people who always confuse left and right, and Microsoft
provides  a complementary map  of your  own town  to aid  you in finding
paths that only include left turns." explained Gates.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->
<UL>For
the more conservative driver,  Microsoft has dazzled industry critics  by
 providing  an AmeriDrive(TM) console.  This  console currently supports
the only available  standards document (1.7b), and  some minor  features
 such as  acceleration,  steering,  and brakes  are not  fully supported.
 Microsoft  fully stands behind the AmeriDrive  and maintains  that it is
 "not just a check-box" item for compatibility's sake.<!-- lm: 0x2 5 -->
</UL><!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>The "Redmond" will go into a wide public beta
program next month,  "to make  sure  that we've  got the safest,  most tested
car  ever  to hit the marked.",  according to  Microsoft officials.  The
product will be available to the general public in Q2.
