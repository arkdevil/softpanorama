Party!
<P>
We held our first annual Christmas party at the Columbia Holiday Inn Executive
Center. There was plenty of food and drinks, Phillip decked out as the jolly
old elf, and<B> LOADS</B> of giveaways. OS/2 for Windows, Backmaster, VX-REXX,
Simply Money, Stacker for OS/2, WordPerfect Office, and even handmade Christmas
ornaments were all given away. Thanks to IBM, MSR Development, Watcom, Computer
Associates, Stac, Harvey Summers, and Penny Sheperd (respectfully) for donating
the items given away!
<P>
We also had a tape of the now famous OS/2 vs. Windows NT shootout held by
the Houston Area League of PC users last June. Uncut and unedited, it showed
OS/2 blowing NT away in a head to head shootout. Well, almost head to head:
NT pretty much only ran a slide show of what it "would" do, while OS/2 actually
did it's thing.
