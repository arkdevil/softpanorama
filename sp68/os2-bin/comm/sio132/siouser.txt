                                     INTRODUCTION

          SIO.SYS and VSIO.SYS are companion device drivers for Version 2
          (and up) of the OS/2 operating system.

          Both drivers (SIO/VSIO) have been coded with performance in mind,
          possibly sacrificing some compatibility.  For this reason, SIO
          and VSIO are not exact replacements for the OS/2 drivers COM and
          VCOM.  However, all serial communications programs tested by the
          author work correctly using SIO/VSIO.

          This manual is intended for the SIO user.  A separate SIO
          Technical Reference Manual is included in the distribution zip. 
          The Technical Reference Manual also documents some advanced
          options and features that are not documented here.

          This manual and the software distributed with it is provided with
          no guarantees.  Use it at your own risk.

                                     WHAT IS SIO

          SIO is a Serial Input/Output (SIO) communications driver.  It
          provides an interface between application programs and the serial
          communications hardware.

          SIO had been designed as a high performance replacement for the
          OS/2 device driver COM.SYS.  See the Technical Reference Manual
          for information about the known differences between COM.SYS and
          SIO.SYS.

          SIO works with 8250 (type) serial I/O devices.  Such devices
          include, but are not limited to the 8250A, 16450, 16550, 16550A
          and the 82510.  If you have a PC that is an IBM or near
          compatible which has a serial communication port, it is likely
          that it contains one of these devices.  In addition, SIO supports
          some intelligent serial I/O cards.  See "Intelligent Cards
          Supported" for additional information.  SIO will identify the
          type of serial devices that it finds and display them at load
          time.

          Like other Device Drivers, SIO will do very little standing
          alone.  There must be an application(s) program that makes use of
          SIO's functions before one will benefit from SIO.







                                                                          2

                                     WHAT IS VSIO

          VSIO is a Virtual Device Driver (VDD).  Virtual device drivers
          provide services for DOS programs executing under OS/2.  Most
          Virtual Device Drivers emulate a specific hardware device and/or
          BIOS service.  The primary job of a Virtual Device Driver is to
          convert misbehaved DOS input/output into well behaved
          input/output that can be accepted by the OS/2 driver SIO.SYS.

          Using the protection mechanism of the 386 (and up) processor, a
          Virtual Device Driver can instruct OS/2 to trap all input/output
          for given hardware ports.  Once trapped, the Virtual Device
          Driver (VDD) appropriately routes information to/from the
          Physical Device Driver (PDD) and to/from the DOS program.

          VSIO creates a virtual (imaginary) 16550A or 16450 (UART) in
          software.  Additionally VSIO emulates the BIOS INT 14h services. 
          All of the hardware registers of the virtual UART are simulated
          by VSIO.  VSIO does not attempt to simulate the timing of the
          real UARTs.  DOS programs that depend on the timing of real
          hardware UARTs may have problems executing under VSIO.

          All DOS programs that execute under VSIO should have RTS/CTS
          handshaking enabled (in the application) even if SIO proper is
          not using RTS/CTS handshake.  

          The virtualization (simulation) provided by VSIO is not (and can
          not be) exact.  However, most well written DOS programs should
          not have problems.

          VSIO will only work with SIO installed and the versions of
          SIO/VSIO must match.  If VSIO refuses to install, you most likely
          have a version mismatch or COM.SYS is still installed.  VSIO will
          not work with any other device driver like COM.SYS.

                               DISTRIBUTION AND SUPPORT

          Distribution and Ordering
          The entire package collectively known as SIO is ShareWare.  It is
          not free software or freeware.  See LICENSE.TXT and ORDER.TXT for
          additional information.  The ShareWare version of SIO is
          distributed electronically and supports only 4 ports (registered
          versions can be ordered supporting up to 16 ports).  One may
          check their favorite electronic hangout for the latest version of
          SIO.  The latest copy of the ShareWare version is always posted
          for downloading from the BBS at 1-703-494-0098.

          Registered versions of SIO are distributed by US Mail,
          electronically mail and from the SIO Distribution and Support
          BBS.  Users desiring to register electronically, may call the BBS
          and register on line (1-703-494-0098) and immediately download
          their registered version of SIO.  Use the ORDER command at the
          main BBS prompt.

          Registrations/Orders can also be placed by phone, mail, FAX, and
          email.  See the front cover of this manual for the phone numbers
          and addresses.  Also see ORDER.TXT for and order form that may be
          used.

          Support
          Extensive testing has been done to insure that this product works
          on the widest possible range of OS/2 V2 (and up) systems.  In
          most cases, problems can be resolved by reading this manual
          carefully.

          Registered users of SIO can update to the latest version using
          the BBS and its UPDATE command.  All variations (number of ports)
          of SIO are available for immediate download from the BBS by
          registered users.

          Support is provided in section 4 of the OS/2 Vendor Forum on
          CompuServe (GO OS2BVEN).  Section 4 of the OS2BVEN Forum is
          dedicated to the support of SIO.

          In addition, support is provided by BBS, Email and FAX.  Voice
          support would overwhelm the author and is not available.  If,
          after reading the manual carefully, you are unable to resolve a

          files from the distribution file you need the program PKUNZIP or
          an equivalent.  PKUNZIP is a product of PKWARE and can be
          downloaded from almost any bulletin board system (BBS).  You
          probably already have PKUNZIP and know how to use it, otherwise I
          doubt that you would be reading this.  When PKUNZIP is used to
          extract the various files, -AV should appear after each file name
          as it is extracted.  In addition, the message:

               Authentic files Verified!

          should appear after the extraction process.  If this message does
          not appear, or appears with a name other than Raymond L. Gwinn,
          the file is not an original SIO distribution file.

          The only file that the basic user actually needs is SIO.SYS. 
          Virtual DOS machine (VDM) users will also want VSIO.SYS.  Copy
          one or both of these files to a convenient directory or
          subdirectory on your system.  An installation program
          (INSTALL.EXE) is provided to install the SIO files and modify
          your CONFIG.SYS

          Quick Start

          Create a temporary directory, change into that directory and
          unzip the SIO distribution zip there.  Type INSTALL followed by
          the enter key.  For a basic setup, that is all that is needed.

          If you choose to install SIO manually, the following should be
          done.

          BE SURE THAT ANY SERIAL MOUSE DRIVER APPEARS IN THE CONFIG.SYS
          BEFORE SIO.SYS

          If you are going to use standard communications ports, either
          COM1 or COM2 on an ISA buss (AT or clone), or COM1 through COM4
          on a PS/2, then add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

               DEVICE=SIO.SYS
               DEVICE=VSIO.SYS

          Be sure to REMark out the COM.SYS and VCOM.SYS device drivers if
          they exist in your CONFIG.SYS.

          With the above statements you will be able to use standard COM1
          and/or COM2 (if they exist) on any PC system known to the author.

          If your setup is more complex, you must read on.







                                                                          5

                                 COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

          The command line options are included in the command line that
          loads SIO in the CONFIG.SYS file.  VSIO has no command line
          options.  Command line options are usually grouped by port within
          parenthesis.

          If you use only COM1 and/or COM2, at the standard IRQ and port
          addresses, you will not need any command line options.  However,
          up to four serial communications ports, COM1 thru COM4, can be
          specified at any base port address and any IRQ.  On PS/2 systems
          and some ISA cards, SIO/VSIO supports multiple communications
          devices sharing the same IRQ.

          The basic command line syntax is as follows:

               DEVICE=SIO.SYS (Cn, An, In, Ig, Fc) [(Cn, An, In, Ig, Fc)]

          Where
               "Cn" is the comm port number (1 thru 4) or the string COM1
               thru COMn.  The port number may proceeded by an asterisk "*"
               to indicate that the port may be used as a PCMCIA comm port
               (eg *1 or *COM1).  Note that it is normal for SIO to display
               a warning about not finding anything at PCMCIA ports.

               "An" is a hexadecimal number that defines the base hardware
               I/O port address for the communications port.  If this field
               is left blank, the default I/O port address is used for the
               comm port.  Note that default I/O addresses exist only for
               COM1 through COM4 on AT type systems and for COM1 through
               COM8 on PS/2 systems.

               "In" is an IRQ number (0 thru 15) or the string IRQ0 thru
               IRQ15 or the string NONE.  It is best if one leaves this
               field blank and allows SIO to determine the IRQ, see
               AUTOMATIC IRQ ASSIGNMENT below.  The IRQ choice of NONE is
               provided for cards that can work either with or without an
               IRQ like the Hayes ESP.

               "Ig" is an ignored parameter.  If exists for compatibility
               with COM.SYS.

               "Fc" is the Forced 16550A chip parameter.  If an F is placed
               in this position, a 16550A UART chip type is forced
               regardless of the automatically detected chip type.







                                                                          6


          For a PC with COM1 and COM2 of standard configuration, the
          following command line will load SIO correctly:

               DEVICE=SIO.SYS (1, 3F8, 4) (2, 2f8, 3)

          A more readable, but identical, command line is:

               DEVICE=SIO.SYS (COM1,3F8,IRQ4) (COM2,2F8,IRQ3)

          Forcing a 16550A on COM1 would be as follows:

               DEVICE=SIO.SYS (COM1,3F8,IRQ4,,F) (COM2,2F8,IRQ3)

          In a similar manner, up to sixteen serial communications ports
          (four in the Shareware version) can be defined and supported by
          SIO and VSIO.







                                                                          7

                           Development and Debugging Tools

          The Poor Man's Line Monitor (PMLM.EXE)

          PMLM is basically of interest to developers of comm applications
          and those providing technical support for those applications. 
          This SIO utility is released largely (in self defense) in the
          hope that some users can diagnose their own problems.  PMLM's
          feature of saving trace information to disk will only work with
          registered and beta versions of SIO.

          PMLM provides basic line monitoring for OS/2, DOS and Windows
          comm programs.  All characters sent or received by application
          programs are displayed in the upper portion of the screen. 
          Receive characters are displayed as "white on blue" and
          transmitted characters are displayed "yellow on violet".  Line
          signals, such as CTS are displayed as "dim white on red" when
          turned off and "bright white on red" when turned on.  In
          addition, a signals transition to OFF is displayed in lower case
          and a signals transition to ON is displayed in upper case.

          Status information is displayed in the lower part of the screen. 
          A bright white display means the signal is on, a dim white
          indicates that the signal is off.  In addition, when bright, 
          Rxoff and Txoff indicate the SIO has sent (Txoff) or received
          (Rxoff) an Xoff, and an Xon is pending.

          When a DOS or Windows session uses a comm port, an additional
          line of signal status appears.  This status line shows the state
          of the virtual UART's signals.  Only the signals which MAY be
          different from the real UART's signals are shown.

          "Rx Chars" and "Tx Chars" reflects the number of characters in
          SIO's receive and transmit buffers respectively.

          The last line on the screen shows the keys (from the keyboard)
          that PMLM will recognize.  The bright character shows the key to
          hit for the associated function.  The font keys will not work in
          a windowed OS/2 session.

          PMLM's command line requires one parameter, the comm port number,
          and optionally accepts an additional parameter giving a save
          trace file name.  For example, PMLM 1 COM1INFO.TRC will monitor
          COM1 and save ALL of the communications traffic in the file
          COM1INFO.TRC.  The trace files created by PMLM contain exactly
          the same information that is displayed by PMLM, video attributes
          and all.







                                                                          8


          VIEWPMLM.EXE may be used to view trace files created by PMLM. 
          VIEWPMLM.EXE requires one parameter, the trace file name.  The
          user can use the keys UP, DOWN, PAGEUP, PAGEDOWN, HOME, and END
          to navigate the saved trace file.  Registered SIO users may send
          VIEWPMLM.EXE (along with saved trace files) to anyone for
          technical support purposes.

          VIEWPMLM can be used in native DOS, in DOS sessions under OS/2,
          and in OS/2 sessions.  This means that even those developers and
          support people need not have OS/2 to view the captured
          communications data created by PMLM.

          SIO's Utility (SU.EXE)

          This utility program has several useful commands.  You can obtain
          a list of the available commands by typing SU at any command line
          prompt without any parameters.  One very useful command is SU
          IRQS.  This command will show IRQs that are currently free for
          use.  Commands are provided allowing user control (missing from
          MODE) are available.  Status commands provide a wealth of
          diagnostic information.







                                                                          9

                             Intelligent Cards Supported


          Hayes ESP

          The original ESP (ESP V1) is not supported.  The SIO command line
          must contain the ESP's enhanced I/O port address.  For bit rates
          exceeding 180000bps the IRQ MUST be specified for the master
          port. For lower date rates NONE may be specified for the IRQ. 
          SIO does not search for the ESP ports as the Hayes drivers do
          under DOS/Windows.  This searching can (will) break things under
          OS/2.  The SIO command line for an ESP at I/O port 180h using
          IRQ14 would be as follows:

          DEVICE=path\SIO.SYS (COM1,180,IRQ14)

          If you would like the above reflected to DOS sessions as a
          standard COM1, then use the following command line:

          DEVICE=path\SIO.SYS (COM1,180:3F8,IRQ14:IRQ4)

          Note that the numbers after the colons ":" are the address and
          IRQ of where the port appears to DOS software running under OS/2. 

          Any IRQ specified for an ESP slave port is ignored.  For those
          that like to have a clean looking CONFIG.SYS, SIO will accept
          NONE as the IRQ specification of an ESP slave port.

          If you wish to use the ESP in Compatibility Mode, simply specify
          the base port address that the ESP's compatibility mode is
          configured for (ie 3F8 when configured for COM1).

          Telcor Tport

          The Telcor Tport is supported in both burst mode and 16450
          emulation mode.  When in burst mode, the Tport's 16k FIFOs are
          enabled.  Additionally in burst mode, no IRQ is used by the
          Tport.  In burst mode, any IRQ specified for the Tport is
          ignored.  For those that like to have a clean looking CONFIG.SYS,
          SIO will accept NONE as the IRQ specification of a Tport.  An
          example command line defining a Tport card to be used in burst
          mode; and that is configured for COM1 follows:

          DEVICE=path\SIO.SYS (COM1,Tport@3F8,NONE:IRQ4)

          The Tport's 16450 Emulation mode simply uses a normal SIO command
          line. eg:

          DEVICE=path\SIO.SYS (COM1,3F8,IRQ4:IRQ4)

          In both examples the "IRQ4" following the colon above, means that
          the virtual IRQs are to be sent to a VDM on IRQ4.







                                                                         10

                                        PCMCIA

          OS/2 Version 2.1 introduced limited PCMCIA support which includes
          PCMCIA modems.  I am told that the PCMCIA support will be changed
          in the future, so the following information may change.

          SIO supports PCMCIA comm ports or modems.  However, several other
          device drivers or programs are needed to use a PCMCIA modem under
          OS/2.  One of the needed drivers is provided with OS/2 version
          2.1 and is called PCMCIA.SYS which provided "Card Services".

          Another needed driver, "Socket Services", is usually supplied by
          the computer manufacturer (or supplier).

          A third driver is usually supplied by the modem manufacture (or
          supplier).  This driver is referred to as the "Client Driver" and
          may also be called the modem enabler.

          What all of the above boils down to is that these drivers, or
          their equivalents are needed to enable the PCMCIA modem.  Once
          enabled, SIO can then use the modem.

          The Client Driver (or equivalent) usually allows the modems I/O
          address and IRQ to be assigned.  If so, the address and IRQ
          assigned at the Client Driver must match an address/IRQ
          combination for a comm port known to SIO.  This is not a problem
          if one is using standard addresses and IRQs for the comm ports.

          If the OS/2 drivers are not available, you can also try to enable
          your PCMCIA modem using a DOS VDM and drivers/programs supplied
          for DOS.  This has worked for many users.

          IBM's ThinkPad EasyPlaying System

          IBM has released a set of PCMCIA drivers and DLLs for use with
          the ThinkPad 750.  The drivers and DLLs are included in a file
          named UT750.EXE which can be downloaded from a library in the
          THINKPAD forum on CompuServe.  This set of drivers seems to be
          generic for ISA systems and any MCA system.  That is, the drivers
          and DLLs do not seem to be specific to the ThinkPad 750 and will
          work on any ISA system (I think).

          I managed to get the EasyPlaying system up on my ThinkPad 720c
          (MCA architecture) by replacing two of the ISA drivers with two
          of the 720's PCMCIA drivers.  I used the 750c utilities disk and
          executed PCMINST2 from drive A and let it do its thing.  I then
          went into the config.sys file and replaced the ISA driver names
          with the MCA driver names, shuffled the drivers around (SIO.SYS
          must be loaded before AUTODRV2.SYS).  Anyhow, the logical
          sequence of all the drivers ended up as shown below.







                                                                         11

          DEVICE=C:\PCMCIA\ICRMU02.SYS
          DEVICE=D:\THINKPAD\$ICPMOS2.SYS

          The only difference for ISA systems is that the drivers
          IBM2SS02.SYS and ICRMU02.SYS are suffixed with a 1.  That is, ISA
          systems use IBM2SS01.SYS and ICRMU01.SYS.  The PCMCIA modem was
          loaded at COM2 in the above example.  No changes were made in the
          AUTODRV2.INI file.







                                                                         12


                               AUTOMATIC IRQ ASSIGNMENT

          SIO will automatically locate the IRQ that a comm port is
          attached to.  The IRQ used by SIO for a given comm port is
          assigned in the following manner:

          1 - If an IRQ is specified in the SIO command line then that IRQ
          is used.  However, SIO will display a warning message if the IRQ
          seems to be other than specified.

          2 - If no IRQ is specified in the command line, and if SIO
          detected the IRQ then the detected IRQ is used.

          3 - If no IRQ is specified in the command, and if SIO could NOT
          detect an IRQ then the default IRQ for the comm port is used. 
          SIO will also display a warning message in this case.

          The following STYLE command line is recommended for all but the
          most unusual systems.  That is, specify only the port number for
          those above COM2 (to tell SIO to support those ports) and let SIO
          do the rest.

          DEVICE=SIO.SYS (COM3) (COM4)

          If you do not have a COM3 or COM4, or if the mouse is using the
          only comm port above COM2 then the following command line should
          be used.

          DEVICE=SIO.SYS







                                                                         13

                                     DOS SETTINGS

          VSIO gets its operational characteristics from DOS Settings. 
          Several basic DOS Settings are provided.  They specify the type
          of access (if any) that a DOS program is to have to a
          communication port that SIO controls.

          All of the DOS Settings default to what most users should use
          most of the time (which is ON).  Also, all of the DOS Settings
          are prefixed with SIO_.

          If any of the DOS settings are changed, then the DOS session must
          be restarted from the Work Place Shell for the changed setting to
          take affect.

          The provided DOS Settings and their meaning follow:

               "SIO_Allow_Access_COMn" (where n is 1 thru 4).  This DOS
               setting defaults to ON.  If this setting is turned OFF for
               any or all of the ports, the DOS program will not be allowed
               any access to that port(s).

               "SIO_Virtualize_COM_Ports"  This Dos setting defaults to ON
               and it applies to all communications ports used by the DOS
               session.  When ON, this DOS setting means VSIO is to act as
               an interface between the SIO and the DOS program.  When OFF,
               the DOS program is given direct access to the hardware ports
               of the UART(s).

               "SIO_Virtualize_16550A"  This DOS setting defaults to ON and
               it applies to all communications ports used by the DOS
               session.  When ON, VSIO will simulate a 16550A.  When OFF,
               VSIO will simulate a 16450.  Some DOS programs may not work
               when a 16550A is simulated.  Turning this setting off may
               allow the program to work (but slower).

               "SIO_Share_Access_With_OS/2"  This DOS setting defaults to
               ON and it applies to all communications ports used by the
               DOS session.  When ON, SIO will allow an OS/2 session to
               access a communications port which the DOS session first
               opened (and has not closed).  If set to OFF, then the DOS
               session will have exclusive use of the communications
               port(s) that it uses.

               This setting does not apply to a second DOS session
               attempting to access a communications port,  two different
               DOS sessions are never allowed to access the same port at
               the same time.  Additionally, this setting has no affect
               upon the access to a communications port which is first
               opened by an OS/2 session.

               "SIO_Screen_Sync_Kludge" DOS setting.  This DOS setting
               defaults to off and it applies to all communications ports
               used by the DOS session.  Some DOS BBS programs (such as
               Wildcat) and many DOS Door programs attempt to synchronize
               the screen output with transmitted data.  This plays havoc
               with a multi tasking system like OS/2 and results in very
               slow transmitted data.  When this setting is on, an attempt
               is made to fake out these misbehaved programs and allow them
               to run at normal transmit speed.  This setting should not be
               turned on unless you experience VERY slow transmission from
               a DOS program.

          All of the DOS Settings that begin with "SIO_Mode"  allows one to
          construct a MODE command for a DOS session.  These settings apply
          to SIO proper, and not necessarily to the DOS program itself. 
          For example, if you set XON/XOFF handshake with the appropriate
          SIO_Mode setting, you are specifying that SIO is to implement the
          handshaking.  The DOS application itself will be unaware of this
          handshaking.  This can be very confusing, so think it through
          before you start changing the defaults.

          The "SIO_Mode" settings WILL NOT BE APPLIED IF THE COMM PORT IS
          ALREADY OPEN WHEN THE DOS SESSION FIRST ACCESSES THE COMM PORT. 
          This means that the "SIO_Mode" settings will NOT be asserted for
          spawned DOS comm programs.  That is, for spawned DOS comm
          programs, the mode of operation that is already in effect will
          continue to be in effect and the "SIO_Mode" settings are ignored.

               "SIO_Mode_DTR"  This setting has three options that specify
               how SIO and VSIO are to treat the DTR signal.  The there
               available option are:
                         No Change at OPEN or CLOSE.
                         Turn ON at OPEN, OFF at CLOSE.
                         HandShake Signal, as in DTR/DSR.

                    If either of the first two settings is selected, then
                    basically the DOS application has direct control over
                    the DTR signal.  If the second option is selected, then
                    DTR will be turned on by SIO when the DOS program first
                    touches the comm port.

                    If the third option is selected, then SIO will use DTR
                    as a handshaking signal.  That is, DTR will be turned
                    off if SIO can not accept any further receive data.  In
                    addition, if the DOS application program turns off the
                    Virtual DTR, VSIO will stop supplying the DOS
                    application with receive data.

               "SIO_Mode_IDSR"  This setting specifies how SIO is to react
               to received data and the DSR signal.  The two available
               options are:
                         Ignore DSR During Receive.
                         Required for Valid Receive Data.

                    If the first option (the default) is selected, then SIO
                    will ignore DSR and accept all received data.  If the
                    second option is selected, then SIO will ignore
                    received data when the DSR signal is off.  VSIO ignores
                    this DOS setting.

               "SIO_Mode_OCTS"  This setting specifies how SIO will react
               to the CTS signal when transmitting data.  The two available
               options are:
                         HandShake Signal, as in RTS/CTS.
                         Ignore CTS During Transmit.

                    If the first option (the default) is selected, then SIO
                    will not transmit data when the CTS signal is off.  If
                    the second option is selected, then SIO will ignore CTS
                    during transmit.  Note that this setting should be set
                    to "Ignore" for 3 wire connections like the Seiko Smart
                    Label Printer, and Laplink.  VSIO ignores this setting

               "SIO_Mode_ODSR"  This setting specifies how SIO is to react
               to the DSR signal during transmit.  The two available
               options are:
                         Ignore DSR During Transmit.
                         HandShake Signal, as in DTR/DSR.

                    If the first option (the default) is selected, then SIO
                    will ignore DSR during transmit.  If the second option
                    is selected, then SIO will not transmit data when the
                    DSR signal is off.  VSIO ignores this setting.


               "SIO_Mode_RTS" This setting has three options that specify
               how SIO and VSIO are to treat the RTS signal.  The there
               available option are:
                         HandShake Signal, as in RTS/CTS.
                         No Change at OPEN or CLOSE.
                         Turn ON at OPEN, OFF at CLOSE.

                    If either of the last two settings is selected, then
                    basically the DOS application has direct control over
                    the RTS signal.  If the last option is selected, then
                    RTS will be turned on by SIO when the DOS program first
                    touches the comm port.

                    If the first option (the default) is selected, then SIO
                    will use RTS as a handshaking signal.  That is, RTS
                    will be turned off if SIO can not accept any further
                    receive data.  In addition, if the DOS application
                    program turns off the virtual RTS signal, VSIO will
                    stop supplying the DOS application with receive data.







                                                                         17


               "SIO_Mode_XON/XOFF"  This setting specifies if (and how) SIO
               is to use XON/XOFF flow control.  The four options are:
                         No XON/XOFF flow control by SIO.
                         Received XON is flow control.
                         Sent XON is flow control.
                         Rcvd and Sent XON is flow control.

                    The first option (the default) specifies that SIO is
                    not to use XON/XOFF flow control at all.  The second
                    option specifies that SIO is to treat received XON/XOFF
                    as flow control, but that SIO must not send XON/XOFF as
                    flow control characters.  The third option specifies
                    that SIO may send XON/XOFF as flow control characters,
                    but that received XON/XOFF characters are to be treated
                    as normal data.  The fourth option turns on XON/XOFF
                    flow control in both directions, meaning that all sent
                    and received XON/XOFF characters are flow control.







                                                                         18


               "SIO_Mode_FIFO_Load_Count"  This setting specifies how many
               characters that SIO will load into a 16550A UART at one
               time.  The choices are 1 and 16 (16 is the default).  The
               only case known to the author where one would select a
               setting of 1, is when very fast reaction to flow control is
               needed.  One such case is the Seiko Smart Label Printer
               which uses XON/XOFF flow control and a 3 wire connection. 
               If one is using a 16550 with a load count of 16, then 16
               additional characters may be sent after an XOFF is received. 
               This condition will overrun the Seiko Printer.  If the "Load
               Count" is set to 1, then SIO will transmit (at most) two
               additional characters following a received XOFF which allows
               the Seiko Printer to work.  A setting of 1 will cause
               additional system overhead due to additional transmit
               interrupts.

                                Configuration Profiles

          I will attempt to provide the DOS Settings that one should try
          for DOS communications programs in this section.  The settings
          may not work on all systems.  I will add to this section as I
          receive information from users.  All DOS Settings that are not
          given should be at their defaults.

          Seiko Smart Label Printer.
               I tested the Seiko printer successfully using the following
               DOS settings for SIO:

               SIO_Mode_DTR                No Change at OPEN or CLOSE
               SIO_Mode_FIFO_Load_Count    1.
               SIO_Mode_IDSR               Ignore DSR During Receive
               SIO_Mode_OCTS               Ignore CTS During Transmit
               SIO_Mode_ODSR               Ignore DSR During Transmit
               SIO_Mode_RTS                No Change at OPEN or CLOSE
               SIO_Mode_XON/XOFF"          Received XON is flow control

          In addition, you should run the printer in it's own separate
          Win-OS/2 session.

          IBM's SLIP
               I have been told by many users that a MODE command is
               required for IBM's SLIP program to work correctly.  The
               recommended MODE command is as follows:

               MODE DTR=ON







                                                                         20

                      Differences between SIO/VSIO and COM/VCOM

          What follows is some of the differences between SIO/VSIO and
          COM/VCOM that are known to the author.

          1 -  COM.SYS will automatically seek out and support four
               comm ports, COM1 through COM4.  SIO.SYS will
               automatically seek out and support only COM1 and COM2. 
               If SIO.SYS is to support more than two comm ports, they
               must be defined in the command line that loads SIO.SYS. 
               For example, DEVICE=SIO.SYS (COM3) (COM4) will cause
               SIO.SYS to support four comm ports.

          2 -  In the absence of overrides in the command line,
               COM.SYS will seek out four comm ports in the sequence
               of I/O ports 3F8h, 2F8h, 3E8h and 2E8h.  The first port
               found in this sequence is given the logical name COM1,
               the second is COM2 etc.  This means that the comm port
               at 2F8h could become COM1.  In the opinion of the
               author, this confuses some users to frustration.

               With no command line overrides, SIO.SYS uses a fixed
               I/O port concept.  That is, COM1 is always at I/O port
               3F8h, COM2 is always at 2F8h, etc.  Another way of
               looking at this is;  if no comm port exists at port
               3F8h, then you do not have a COM1.  SIO.SYS will not
               move another (found) comm port into the logical COM1
               slot.

          3 -  VSIO opens a comm port for a DOS session with sharing
               allowed.  VCOM uses an "exclusive use" open for DOS
               sessions.

          4 -  SIO.SYS always controls the FIFOs of the 16550 UART. 
               SIO.SYS will not allow an application program (OS2 or DOS)
               to disable the FIFOs of a real 16550.  The application may
               specify the transmit fifo load count.

          5 -  SIO.SYS will accept any number between 50 and 115200 (921600
               if a Hayes ESP) as a valid baud rate.  For example, if an
               application program attempts to set a baud rate of 9990 bps,
               COM.SYS will reject it and SIO.SYS will accept it.

          6 -  SIO/VSIO execute faster than COM/VCOM.  This means that some
               applications, that are timing dependent, may not work under
               SIO/VSIO that do work under COM/VCOM.







                                                                         21


          7 -  VSIO optionally (and by default) simulates a 16550A for DOS
               sessions.  VCOM simulates a 8250/16450.

          8 -  SIO/VSIO provides more reliable active flow control for DOS
               sessions.  For example, if RTS/CTS handshaking is in use,
               VSIO processes the RTS settings by the DOS program while SIO
               completely controls the real RTS signal.  COM/VCOM simply
               passes the RTS signal directly to the hardware.

          9 -  COM.SYS will block an application until a write completes. 
               SIO will return to the application program immediately if
               all of the write data will fit into SIO's internal buffers.







                                                                         22


                                PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS

          1 -  Port already in use is displayed.

               This message is displayed when the comm port or the IRQ is
               in use.  If the comm port is not actually in use, the IRQ is
               most likely in use.

          2 -  SIO displays a warning message that the IRQ for a port
               appears to be wrong, but the port works.

               SIO probably detected more than one IRQ attached to the comm
               port.  This indicates a possible hardware problem with your
               system that you may want to have checked.

          3 - The modem will not initialize.

               Configure your comm program(s) to insert a delay between
               modem initialization characters as they are sent to the
               modem.

          4 - WinFax locks up during install.

               During the WinFax install, temporarily turn OFF the DOS
               setting SIO_Virtualize_COM_Ports.  Once installation is
               complete, the setting SIO_Virtualize_COM_Ports can be
               restored.

          5 - Telemate does not recognize VX00 as a FOSSIL.

               Set the baud rate in Telemate to less than 57600.

          6 -  Comm output is very slow from DOS.

               This is a problem common to many DOS BBS and Door programs. 
               They attempt to synchronize the local screen with the
               transmitted data.  That is, they send a character, wait
               until it is sent and then display the character on the local
               screen.  This does not cause a problem for the single
               tasking DOS environment.  However, this procedure causes at
               least two (probably more) context switches in the multi-
               tasking environment of OS2, which in turn brings the
               processor to its knees.  One possible solution is for the
               programmer to synchronize line by line instead of character
               by character.

          7 -  FaxWorks' driver FMD.SYS cannot access a comm port when SIO
               is used, but works okay with COM.SYS.

               The problem may be that the comm port is in use (often by a
               DOS program).  In all cases known to the author, this has







                                                                         23

               been the case.  That is, FMD.SYS can not access the port
               because it is in use, and FMD.SYS does not report the
               problem in a manner that is understandable to many users.

               COM.SYS seems to have a bug that will allow an OS2 device
               driver (like FMD.SYS) to use a comm port when it is in use
               by a another device driver, and it (COM.SYS) does not cause
               an error when it should.  The exact conditions of this is
               not fully understood by the author and the above supposition
               may not be totally correct.

          8 -  Procomm stops receiving

               Procomm seems to have a bug in its implementation of RTS/CTS
               handshaking.  The problem shows up most often when Procomm
               is windowed.  Under certain conditions, Procomm will turn
               the virtual RTS OFF and does not turn it ON again.  This
               prevents VSIO from sending further data to Procomm if
               SIO_Mode_RTS is set for RTS/CTS handshake.  A solution to
               the problem that seems to work is to set SIO_Mode_RTS to
               other than RTS/CTS handshake.  Note that SIO_Mode_RTS should
               be set for RTS/CTS handshake under almost all other
               conditions.

          9 - WinFax does not work well.

               a- Connect problems with recipient's fax station

               b- Cannot send more than one page of a multiple page fax

               c- Transmission fails between pages

               off.

               Class 1 FAX modem.
                         The modem init strings set by WinFax 3.0 will work
                         in the single-layered comm world of DOS and
                         Windows.  However, these modem init strings will
                         not work in the multi-layered comm environment
                         used by OS/2.  Specifically, WinFax 3.0 sets the
                         modem to use only Xon/Xoff flow control.  Ideally,
                         both Xon/Xoff and Hardware handshaking needs to be
                         set.  If only one handshake can be set, set the
                         modem to Hardware handshake.  For USR FAX modems,
                         use &H3, for many other modems, the setting is
                         &K3.  Additionally, for WinFax 3.04 and up, place
                         the following in your WINFAX.INI file:
                              HdwFlowControl=1

               Class 2 FAX modem.
                         It seems to the author that hardware handshake
                         screws up some (possibly all) class 2 FAX modems. 
                         Therefore, when using a class 2 modem, WinFax
                         should be configured to use XON/XOFF handshaking. 
                         For WinFax 3.04 and up, place the following in
                         your WINFAX.INI file:
                              HdwFlowControl=0

                         The author feels that the inability to use
                         hardware handshake with class 2 FAX modems is a
                         serious design deficiency.

                                  IRQ SHARING ON ISA

          Sharing the same IRQ for multiple communications ports on ISA
          systems is not for the weak of heart (or mind).  If you have
          problems with shared IRQs, DO NOT contact the author.  Contact
          the board or computer manufacturer for help.

          Some general rules are as follows:

          1 - Two different boards (plugged into different slots) can not
          share the same IRQ.  This is a hardware limitation of ISA systems
          and can not be corrected by software.  This means that you can
          not plug in two internal modems, set them for the same IRQ and
          expect them to work.  This does not apply to PS/2 systems.  The
          problem of multiple boards sharing the same IRQ was corrected in
          the PS/2's buss design.

          2 - SIO can not (will not) share an IRQ with other device drivers
          at the same time.  SIO releases IRQs that it is currently not
          using.  This is different form how COM.SYS works.  This
          difference may show up as an unexpected "port already in use"
          error that does not occur with COM.SYS.  I have received reports
          that the SDLC drivers try to concurrently share IRQs with the
          ASYNC driver.  SIO.SYS will not allow this while COM.SYS will.

                    Appendix A, Hardware Port and IRQ Assignments

          I have obtained the following information from various sources. 
          Accuracy is not guaranteed.  In fact, nothing in this document is
          guaranteed.

          Addresses and IRQs for COM1 and COM2

               COM1 uses 03F8h and IRQ4
               COM2 uses 02F8h and IRQ3

          Defacto standard for COM3 and COM4 for PC, XT and AT

               COM3 uses 03E8h and IRQ4
               COM4 uses 02E8h and IRQ3

          Addresses and IRQ for COM3 through COM8 on the PS/2

               COM3 uses 3220h and IRQ3
               COM4 uses 3228h and IRQ3
               COM5 uses 4220h and IRQ3
               COM6 uses 4228h and IRQ3
               COM7 uses 5220h and IRQ3
               COM8 uses 5228h and IRQ3

          All PCs (known to the author) prior to the PS/2 and EISA only use
          10 bits to address hardware I/0 ports.  Systems prior to the PS/2
          and EISA can not address the standard PS/2 addresses for COM3
          through COM8.  If an AT or below attempts to address COM3 through
          COM8 using the PS/2 addresses, only the low 10 bits of the
          address are used.  That is, the high digit of the hexadecimal
          address will be ignored.  This means that any reference to COM3
          through COM8 will actually address ports 220h through 22Fh on
          older PCs.

          One should avoid expansion boards that use ports 220h through
          22Fh unless the expansion board is a serial I/O board. 

          SIO will (attempt to) determine the hardware architecture
          (ISA/EISA and PS/2) that it is being executed on and use the
          appropriate hardware port addresses for COM1 thru COM4 as
          defaults.

                                Appendix B, SIO Chips


          The following is a collection of comments developed from hearsay,
          random documents, experience, and technical specifications. So,
          take it with a grain of salt.  Order information from the various
          manufactures if you want accurate information.

          Very good reference books are available from National
          Semiconductor Corporation.  They cover most of the SIO devices
          (also called UARTs) that you will find in many PCs and clones.  I
          am not sure that books can be ordered directly from National
          semiconductor. They may require that you get it from a
          distributor.  In any case, the address on the back of the one
          manual is:

               National Semiconductor Corporation

               P.O. Box 58090

               TWX:(910)339-9240

          8250

          As best that I know, the 8250 was the first SIO chip (integrated
          circuit) that was used by the IBM PC and many clones.  In my
          opinion, it was a poor choice on the part of IBM.  I feel many
          superior devices, at comparable prices, were readily available. 
          At that time, I feel the 8251A or the 8530 would have been better
          choices.  But, they used the 8250 and therefore we must use it.

          From a hardware standpoint the 8250 is a relatively slow device. 
          It is advisable that programmers not perform successive inputs or
          outputs to this device.  It seems that software programs can load
          the various registers of the 8250 faster than it can process the
          information.  The 8250 had a total of 7 registers.  The
          specifications state that 56kb is the maximum baud rate.

          8250A

          I believe the 8250A is the 8250 with some bug fixes.  I have no
          idea what the bugs may have been.  A quick glance at the
          specifications shows the speed of the 8250 and 8250A to be much
          the same.  The 8250A added an 8th register.  This additional
          register enables software to detect if an 8250 is installed.  The
          specifications state that 56kb is the maximum baud rate.







                                                                         28

          16450

          The 16450 seems to be a speeded up version of the 8250A.  There
          is no direct way (that I know of) for software to detect the
          difference between an 8250A and a 16450.  I believe the 16450 was
          developed to eliminate the need for software to insert delays
          between successive accesses to the device.  The specifications
          indicate the 16450 is a much faster device than its predecessors. 
          The additional speed is only the speed at which the processor can
          access the device.  The maximum baud rate for the 16450 is still
          stated at 56kb.  However, I have been told by some people that
          they have run the 16450 successfully at much higher speeds. I do
          not believe there was ever a 16450A.

          16C451

          The 16C451 is a CMOS version of the 16450.  CMOS is a term for
          the material and manufacturing process used to make the part. 
          CMOS typically uses less power than other technologies.  If you
          are not designing hardware, you should view the 16C451 as a
          16450.

          16550 (Non A)

          It is hard to find a 16550 (Non A).  I was told by National
          Semiconductor that they did everything they could to get all
          16550s back.  SIO will detect a 16550 and tell you if you have
          one.  I am told that the 16550 was installed in early PS/2
          systems.

          The 16550 was the first shot at a FIFOed version of the 8250
          family from National semiconductor.  However, I was told by
          National Semiconductor that the FIFOs of the 16550 are not
          reliable and they should not be enabled.  SIO will treat a 16550
          like a 16450.  In this mode, they are reliable.  National
          Semiconductor would not provide me with a specification for the
          16550.  However, I suspect its maximum baud rate is the same as
          the 16550A which is 256kb.

          16550A, 16550AF and 16550AFN

          In the manuals that I have, National Semiconductor does not
          explain the differences between the 16550A and the 16550AF.  I
          suspect the AF part may have a few bug fixes.  I believe the N in
          AFN describes packaging, ceramic versus plastic, DIP versus
          surface mount etc.

          In the opinion of the author, there is no substitute for the
          16550A (and its successors) in the 8250 type series.  The 16550A
          is compatible with most software written for the entire family of
          8250 type devices.  Programs that are 16550A aware can provide
          much improved performance over previous devices.







                                                                         29


          The maximum baud rate for the 16550A is specified at 256kb. 
          However, due to the hardware design of the PC et al, 115kb is the
          maximum baud rate that can be programmed by software.

          The 16550A can be plugged into the same socket that contains an
          8250, 8250A or 16450.  If your SIO expansion board has the SIO
          chips in sockets, you can upgrade to the 16550A by simply
          removing the old chips and replacing them with 16550As.

          The key to the performance increase of the 16550A is its FIFOs. 
          It has 16 byte FIFOs for both transmit and receive data.

          16550s Made by Western Digital

          I have been told, but I have not verified for myself, that 16550s
          made by Western Digital have a problem with their FIFOs when
          working at 2400 baud or below.

          16C551

          The 16C551 is a CMOS version of the 16550AF.  See the above
          description of the 16C451 for a discussion of CMOS.  Do not feel
          you need to upgrade from a 16550A or AF to a 16C551.  There is no
          gain from an existing users point of view.

          16C552

          The 16C552 is two 16C551s on a single chip.

          16C554

          The 16C554 is four 16C551s on a single chip.

          82510

          I believe Intel is the only company that manufactures the 82510. 
          The 82510 is feature rich with several modes of operation.  Its
          default mode is to operate as a 16450.  The 82510 has a 4 byte
          FIFO for both transmit and receive data.  A 4 byte FIFO is
          sufficient to provide significant performance over a basic 16450.

          The 82510 is small in size.  Therefore, it is found in many lap
          tops.

          The 82510 is somewhat of a sleeper.  I believe it would be much
          more widely used if Intel had promoted it more.  However, given a
          choice between the 82510 and the 16550A, I would select the
          16550A.

                       Appendix C, Multi-Port Serial I/0 Cards

          I have received many requests for information about multi-port
          serial I/O card.  I will describe the boards that I know about
          (or have heard about) here.  I will add to the list as I receive
          precise information from manufactures, users, or I develop it
          myself.

          STB 4COM  (ISA buss)

          I am very impressed with the STB 4COM card, they have almost got
          it.  Yes, its the same company that makes the VGA cards.  The
          4COM card uses a 16554 which is the equivalent of four 16550A. 
          Comm ports can use IRQs 2/9, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, and 15.  Any or
          all ports can share IRQs, and they have done this right.  I
          tested SIO with all four ports of the 4COM on IRQ12 and they
          worked correctly.  The user can select any of the following I/O
          port address for a comm port: 3F8, 2F8, 3E8, 2E8, 1A8, 1E8, 1F8,
          2A8.

          The 4COM card is priced at $110 and I ordered mine from

          Gtek BBS550 (ISA buss)

          The Gtek BBS550 is a communications card with the equivalent of 8
          16550s (in reality two 16554s) UARTs.  Where were these cards 5
          years ago!  Like the STB 4COM, I am very impressed with the
          BBS550.  It has a wide range of selectable I/O port address, some
          in the 16 bit range (above 3FFh) which can be very useful.  I
          tested the board with all 8 ports installed using IRQ3 (although
          I never had more than 3 ports active at the same time).  The
          board performed well using shared IRQs.

          The BBS550 has 8 RJ-45 connectors (10 pin), 6 of which comes
          directly off the back of the card.  The other two RJ-45
          connectors are internal and special cables with grommets are
          supplier for these 2 ports.  The cables supplied with the BBS550
          expands the RJ-45 out to standard DB-25 connectors.

          Gtek is located in St. Louis Mississippi.  Their phone number is
          800-282-4835 or 601-467-8048.

          Neotech Quad Serial (MCA buss)

          Well, I just got my first PS/2 system (for testing of SIO) and I
          am using the NeoTech Quad Serial card in that system.  What can I
          say, it works beautifully and interrupt sharing has never been a
          problem on MCA systems.  This card (as shipped) came with four
          individual 16450 chips installed, but they were in sockets so I
          installed 16550 UARTs before I installed the card.  The card has
          one large connector on the back of the card and the supplied
          cable expands that to 4 standard DB-25 connectors.  Those of you
          needing a good 4 port card for an MCA system contact:
