Ray Gwinn's comm drivers for OS2, V1.32.
SIO.SYS and VSIO.SYS are replacements of the
OS2 communications drivers COM.SYS and
VCOM.SYS which come with OS/2.  VX00.SYS
provides FOSSIL support for DOS comm
programs, and creates a virtulal 16550 for
programs that do not support FOSSIL.  SIO
can be ordered to support up to 16 ports.
