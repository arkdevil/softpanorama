<!-- entering slot 37 -->
<P>
I tested the Seiko printer successfully using the following DOS settings
for SIO:     SIO_Mode_DTR         No Change at OPEN or CLOSE
<BR>
    SIO_Mode_FIFO_Load_Count  1.
<BR>
    SIO_Mode_IDSR        Ignore DSR During Receive
<BR>
    SIO_Mode_OCTS        Ignore CTS During Transmit
<BR>
    SIO_Mode_ODSR        Ignore DSR During Transmit
<BR>
    SIO_Mode_RTS         No Change at OPEN or CLOSE
<BR>
    SIO_Mode_XON/XOFF     Received XON is flow control
<BR>

<P>
In addition, you should run the printer in it's own separate Win-OS/2 session.
