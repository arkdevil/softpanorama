<P>
SIO will automatically locate the IRQ that a comm port is attached to.  The
IRQ used by SIO for a given comm port is assigned in the following manner:

<P>
1 - If an IRQ is specified in the SIO command line then that IRQ is used.
 However, SIO will display a warning message if the IRQ seems to be other
than specified.
<P>
2 - If no IRQ is specified in the command line, and if SIO detected the
IRQ then the detected IRQ is used.
<P>
3 - If no IRQ is specified in the command, and if SIO could NOT detect an
IRQ then the default IRQ for the comm port is used. SIO will also display
a warning message in this case.
<P>
The following STYLE command line is recommended for all but the most unusual
systems.  That is, specify only the port number for those above COM2 (to
tell SIO to support those ports) and let SIO do the rest.
<P>
    DEVICE=SIO.SYS (COM3) (COM4)
<P>
If you do not have a COM3 or COM4, or if the mouse is using the only comm
port above COM2 then the following command line should be used.
<P>
    DEVICE=SIO.SYS
