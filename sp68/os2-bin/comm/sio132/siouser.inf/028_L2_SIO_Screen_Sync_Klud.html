<P>
"SIO_Screen_Sync_Kludge" DOS setting.  This DOS setting defaults to off
and it applies to all communications ports used by the DOS session.  Some
DOS BBS programs (such as Wildcat) and many DOS Door programs attempt to
synchronize the screen output with transmitted data.  This plays havoc with
a multi tasking system like OS/2 and results in very slow transmitted data.
 When this setting is on, an attempt is made to fake out these misbehaved
programs and allow them to run at normal transmit speed.  This setting should
not be turned on unless you experience VERY slow transmission from a DOS
program.
