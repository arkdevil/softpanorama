<P>
For a PC with COM1 and COM2 of standard configuration, the following command
line will load SIO correctly:
<P>
   DEVICE=SIO.SYS (1, 3F8, 4) (2, 2f8, 3)
<P>
A more readable, but identical, command line is:
<P>
   DEVICE=SIO.SYS (COM1,3F8,IRQ4) (COM2,2F8,IRQ3)
<P>
Forcing a 16550A on COM1 would be as follows:
<P>
   DEVICE=SIO.SYS (COM1,3F8,IRQ4,,F) (COM2,2F8,IRQ3)
<P>
In a similar manner, up to sixteen serial communications ports (four in
the Shareware version) can be defined and supported by SIO and VSIO.
