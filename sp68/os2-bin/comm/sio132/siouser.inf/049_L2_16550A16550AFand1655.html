<P>
In the manuals that I have, National Semiconductor does not explain the
differences between the 16550A and the 16550AF.  I suspect the AF part may
have a few bug fixes.  I believe the N in AFN describes packaging, ceramic
versus plastic, DIP versus surface mount etc.
<P>
In the opinion of the author, there is no substitute for the 16550A (and
its successors) in the 8250 type series.  The 16550A is compatible with
most software written for the entire family of 8250 type devices.  Programs
that are 16550A aware can provide much improved performance over previous
devices.
<P>
The maximum baud rate for the 16550A is specified at 256kb. However, due
to the hardware design of the PC et al, 115kb is the maximum baud rate that
can be programmed by software.
<P>
The 16550A can be plugged into the same socket that contains an 8250, 8250A
or 16450.  If your SIO expansion board has the SIO chips in sockets, you
can upgrade to the 16550A by simply removing the old chips and replacing
them with 16550As.
<P>
The key to the performance increase of the 16550A is its FIFOs. It has 16
byte FIFOs for both transmit and receive data.
