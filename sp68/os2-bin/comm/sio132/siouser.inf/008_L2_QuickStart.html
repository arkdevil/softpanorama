Create a temporary directory, change into that directory and unzip the SIO
distribution zip there.  Type INSTALL followed by the enter key.  For a
basic setup, that is all that is needed.
<P>
If you choose to install SIO manually, the following should be done.
<P>
BE SURE THAT ANY SERIAL MOUSE DRIVER APPEARS IN THE CONFIG.SYS BEFORE SIO.SYS

<P>
If you are going to use standard communications ports, either COM1 or COM2
on an ISA buss (AT or clone), or COM1 through COM4 on a PS/2, then add the
following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:    DEVICE = SIO.SYS
<BR>
   DEVICE = VSIO.SYS
<BR>

<P>
Be sure to REMark out the COM.SYS and VCOM.SYS device drivers if they exist
in your CONFIG.SYS.
<P>
With the above statements you will be able to use standard COM1 and/or COM2
(if they exist) on any PC system known to the author.
