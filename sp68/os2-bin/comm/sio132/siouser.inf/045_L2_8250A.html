<P>
I believe the 8250A is the 8250 with some bug fixes.  I have no idea what
the bugs may have been.  A quick glance at the specifications shows the
speed of the 8250 and 8250A to be much the same.  The 8250A added an 8th
register.  This additional register enables software to detect if an 8250
is installed.  The specifications state that 56kb is the maximum baud rate.
