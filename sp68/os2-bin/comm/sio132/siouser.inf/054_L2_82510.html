<P>
I believe Intel is the only company that manufactures the 82510. The 82510
is feature rich with several modes of operation.  Its default mode is to
operate as a 16450.  The 82510 has a 4 byte FIFO for both transmit and receive
data.  A 4 byte FIFO is sufficient to provide significant performance over
a basic 16450.
<P>
The 82510 is small in size.  Therefore, it is found in many lap tops.
<P>
The 82510 is somewhat of a sleeper.  I believe it would be much more widely
used if Intel had promoted it more.  However, given a choice between the
82510 and the 16550A, I would select the 16550A.
