<P>
I have obtained the following information from various sources. Accuracy
is not guaranteed.  In fact, nothing in this document is guaranteed.  Addresses
and IRQs for COM1 and COM2    COM1 uses 03F8h and IRQ4
<BR>
   COM2 uses 02F8h and IRQ3
<BR>

<P>
Defacto standard for COM3 and COM4 for PC, XT and AT    COM3 uses 03E8h
and IRQ4
<BR>
   COM4 uses 02E8h and IRQ3
<BR>

<P>
Addresses and IRQ for COM3 through COM8 on the PS/2    COM3 uses 3220h and
IRQ3
<BR>
   COM4 uses 3228h and IRQ3
<BR>
   COM5 uses 4220h and IRQ3
<BR>
   COM6 uses 4228h and IRQ3
<BR>
   COM7 uses 5220h and IRQ3
<BR>
   COM8 uses 5228h and IRQ3
<BR>

<P>
All PCs (known to the author) prior to the PS/2 and EISA only use 10 bits
to address hardware I/0 ports.  Systems prior to the PS/2 and EISA can not
address the standard PS/2 addresses for COM3 through COM8.  If an AT or
below attempts to address COM3 through COM8 using the PS/2 addresses, only
the low 10 bits of the address are used.  That is, the high digit of the
hexadecimal address will be ignored.  This means that any reference to COM3
through COM8 will actually address ports 220h through 22Fh on older PCs.

<P>
One should avoid expansion boards that use ports 220h through 22Fh unless
the expansion board is a serial I/O board.
<P>
SIO will (attempt to) determine the hardware architecture (ISA/EISA and
PS/2) that it is being executed on and use the appropriate hardware port
addresses for COM1 thru COM4 as defaults.
