<TITLE>IRQ Sharing on ISA</TITLE>

<!-- entering slot 42 -->
<P>
Sharing the same IRQ for multiple communications ports on ISA systems is
not for the weak of heart (or mind).  If you have problems with shared IRQs,
DO NOT contact the author.  Contact the board or computer manufacturer for
help.
<P>
Some general rules are as follows:
<P>
1 - Two different boards (plugged into different slots) can not share the
same IRQ.  This is a hardware limitation of ISA systems and can not be corrected
by software.  This means that you can not plug in two internal modems, set
them for the same IRQ and expect them to work.  This does not apply to PS/2
systems.  The problem of multiple boards sharing the same IRQ was corrected
in the PS/2's buss design.
<P>
2 - SIO can not (will not) share an IRQ with other device drivers at the
same time.  SIO releases IRQs that it is currently not using.  This is different
form how COM.SYS works.  This difference may show up as an unexpected "port
already in use" error that does not occur with COM.SYS.  I have received
reports that the SDLC drivers try to concurrently share IRQs with the ASYNC
driver.  SIO.SYS will not allow this while COM.SYS will.
