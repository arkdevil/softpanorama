<P>
The Telcor Tport is supported in both burst mode and 16450 emulation mode.
 When in burst mode, the Tport's 16k FIFOs are enabled.  Additionally in
burst mode, no IRQ is used by the Tport.  In burst mode, any IRQ specified
for the Tport is ignored.  For those that like to have a clean looking CONFIG.SYS,
SIO will accept NONE as the IRQ specification of a Tport.  An example command
line defining a Tport card to be used in burst mode; and that is configured
for COM1 follows:
<P>
DEVICE=path\SIO.SYS (COM1,Tport@3F8,NONE:IRQ4)
<P>
The Tport's 16450 Emulation mode simply uses a normal SIO command line.
eg:
<P>
DEVICE=path\SIO.SYS (COM1,3F8,IRQ4:IRQ4)
<P>
In both examples the "IRQ4" following the colon above, means that the virtual
IRQs are to be sent to a VDM on IRQ4.
