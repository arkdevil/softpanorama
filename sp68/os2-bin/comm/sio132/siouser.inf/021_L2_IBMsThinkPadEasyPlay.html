IBM has released a set of PCMCIA drivers and DLLs for use with the ThinkPad
750.  The drivers and DLLs are included in a file named UT750.EXE which
can be downloaded from a library in the THINKPAD forum on CompuServe.  This
set of drivers seems to be generic for ISA systems and any MCA system.  That
is, the drivers and DLLs do not seem to be specific to the ThinkPad 750
and will work on any ISA system (I think).

EasyPlaying driver sequence in CONFIG.SYS

I managed to get the EasyPlaying system up on my ThinkPad 720c (MCA architecture)
by replacing two of the ISA drivers with two of the 720's PCMCIA drivers.
 I used the 750c utilities disk and executed PCMINST2 from drive A and let
it do its thing.  I then went into the config.sys file and replaced the
ISA driver names with the MCA driver names, shuffled the drivers around
(SIO.SYS must be loaded before AUTODRV2.SYS).  Anyhow, the logical sequence
of all the drivers ended up as shown below.

The only difference for ISA systems is that the drivers IBM2SS02.SYS and
ICRMU02.SYS are suffixed with a 1.  That is, ISA systems use IBM2SS01.SYS
and ICRMU01.SYS.  The PCMCIA modem was loaded at COM2 in the above example.
 No changes were made in the AUTODRV2.INI file.
