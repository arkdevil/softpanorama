<P>
"SIO_Virtualize_COM_Ports"  This Dos setting defaults to ON and it applies
to all communications ports used by the DOS session.  When ON, this DOS
setting means VSIO is to act as an interface between the SIO and the DOS
program.  When OFF, the DOS program is given direct access to the hardware
ports of the UART(s).
