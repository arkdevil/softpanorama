<!-- entering slot 30 -->construct a MODE command for a DOS session.  These
settings apply to SIO proper, and not necessarily to the DOS program itself.
For example, if you set XON/XOFF handshake with the appropriate SIO_Mode
setting, you are specifying that SIO is to implement the handshaking.  The
DOS application itself will be unaware of this handshaking.  This can be
very confusing, so think it through before you start changing the defaults.

<P>
The "SIO_Mode" settings WILL NOT BE APPLIED IF THE COMM PORT IS ALREADY
OPEN WHEN THE DOS SESSION FIRST ACCESSES THE COMM PORT. This means that
the "SIO_Mode" settings will NOT be asserted for spawned DOS comm programs.
 That is, for spawned DOS comm programs, the mode of operation that is already
in effect will continue to be in effect and the "SIO_Mode" settings are
ignored.
