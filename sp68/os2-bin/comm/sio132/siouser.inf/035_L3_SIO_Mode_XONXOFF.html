<P>
"SIO_Mode_XON/XOFF"  This setting specifies if (and how) SIO is to use XON/XOFF
flow control.  The four options are:      No XON/XOFF flow control by SIO.
<BR>
     Received XON is flow control.
<BR>
     Sent XON is flow control.
<BR>
     Rcvd and Sent XON is flow control.
<BR>

<P>
The first option (the default) specifies that SIO is not to use XON/XOFF
flow control at all.  The second option specifies that SIO is to treat received
XON/XOFF as flow control, but that SIO must not send XON/XOFF as flow control
characters.  The third option specifies that SIO may send XON/XOFF as flow
control characters, but that received XON/XOFF characters are to be treated
as normal data.  The fourth option turns on XON/XOFF flow control in both
directions, meaning that all sent and received XON/XOFF characters are flow
control.
