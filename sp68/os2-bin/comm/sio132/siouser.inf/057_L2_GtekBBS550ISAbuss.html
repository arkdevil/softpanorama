The Gtek BBS550 is a communications card with the equivalent of 8 16550s
(in reality two 16C552s) UARTs.  Where were these cards 5 years ago!  Like
the STB 4COM, I am very impressed with the BBS550.  It has a wide range
of selectable I/O port address, some in the 16 bit range (above 3FFh) which
can be very useful.  I tested the board with all 8 ports installed using
IRQ3 (although I never had more than 3 ports active at the same time).  The
board performed well using shared IRQs.
<P>
The BBS550 has 8 RJ-45 connectors (10 pin), 6 of which comes directly off
the back of the card.  The other two RJ-45 connectors are internal and special
cables with grommets are supplier for these 2 ports.  The cables supplied
with the BBS550 expands the RJ-45 out to standard DB-25 connectors.

Gtek is located in St. Louis Mississippi.  Their phone number is 800-282-4835
or 601-467-8048.
