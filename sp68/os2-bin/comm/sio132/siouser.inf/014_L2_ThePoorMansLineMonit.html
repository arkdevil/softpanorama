<P>
Simply type PMLM, followed by return, at an OS/2 command line prompt for
example command lines.
<P>
PMLM is basically of interest to developers of comm applications and those
providing technical support for those applications. This SIO utility is
released largely (in self defense) in the hope that some users can diagnose
their own problems.  PMLM's feature of saving trace information to disk
will only work with registered and beta versions of SIO.
<P>
PMLM provides basic line monitoring for OS/2, DOS and Windows comm programs.
 All characters sent or received by application programs are displayed in
the upper portion of the screen. Receive characters are displayed as "white
on blue" and transmitted characters are displayed "yellow on violet".  Line
signals, such as CTS are displayed as "dim white on red" when turned off
and "bright white on red" when turned on.  In addition, a signals transition
to OFF is displayed in lower case and a signals transition to ON is displayed
in upper case.
<P>
Status information is displayed in the lower part of the screen. A bright
white display means the signal is on, a dim white indicates that the signal
is off.  In addition, when bright, Rxoff and Txoff indicate the SIO has
sent (Txoff) or received (Rxoff) an Xoff, and an Xon is pending.
<P>
When a DOS or Windows session uses a comm port, an additional line of signal
status appears.  This status line shows the state of the virtual UART's
signals.  Only the signals which MAY be different from the real UART's signals
are shown.
<P>
"Rx Chars" and "Tx Chars" reflects the number of characters in SIO's receive
and transmit buffers respectively.
<P>
The last line on the screen shows the keys (from the keyboard) that PMLM
will recognize.  The bright character shows the key to hit for the associated
function.  The font keys will not work in a windowed OS/2 session.
<P>
PMLM's command line requires one parameter, the comm port number, and optionally
accepts an additional parameter giving a save trace file name.  For example:

<P>
    PMLM 1 COM1INFO.TRC
<P>
will monitor COM1 and save ALL of the communications traffic in the file
COM1INFO.TRC.  The trace files created by PMLM contain exactly the same
information that is displayed by PMLM, video attributes and all.
