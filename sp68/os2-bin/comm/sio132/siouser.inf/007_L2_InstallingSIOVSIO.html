SIO is distributed as a ZIP file.  To extract the individual files from
the distribution file you need the program PKUNZIP or an equivalent.  PKUNZIP
is a product of PKWARE and can be downloaded from almost any bulletin board
system (BBS).  You probably already have PKUNZIP and know how to use it,
otherwise I doubt that you would be reading this.  When PKUNZIP is used
to extract the various files, -AV should appear after each file name as
it is extracted.  In addition, the message:
<P>
   Authentic files Verified!
<P>
should appear after the extraction process.  If this message does not appear,
or appears with a name other than Raymond L. Gwinn, the file is not an original
SIO distribution file.
<P>
The only file that the basic user actually needs is SIO.SYS. Virtual DOS
machine (VDM) users will also want VSIO.SYS.  Copy one or both of these
files to a convenient directory or subdirectory on your system.  An installation
program (INSTALL.EXE) is provided to install the SIO files and modify your
CONFIG.SYS
