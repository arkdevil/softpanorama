<P>
"SIO_Mode_IDSR"  This setting specifies how SIO is to react to received
data and the DSR signal.  The two available options are:      Ignore DSR
During Receive.
<BR>
     Required for Valid Receive Data.
<BR>

<P>
If the first option (the default) is selected, then SIO will ignore DSR
and accept all received data.  If the second option is selected, then SIO
will ignore received data when the DSR signal is off.  VSIO ignores this
DOS setting.
