<P>
VSIO gets its operational characteristics from DOS Settings. Several basic
DOS Settings are provided.  They specify the type of access (if any) that
a DOS program is to have to a communication port that SIO controls.
<P>
All of the DOS Settings default to what most users should use most of the
time (which is ON).  Also, all of the DOS Settings are prefixed with SIO_.

<P>
If any of the DOS settings are changed, then the DOS session must be restarted
from the Work Place Shell for the changed setting to take affect.
