<P>
"SIO_Mode_RTS" This setting has three options that specify how SIO and VSIO
are to treat the RTS signal.  The there available option are:      HandShake
Signal, as in RTS/CTS.
<BR>
     No Change at OPEN or CLOSE.
<BR>
     Turn ON at OPEN, OFF at CLOSE.
<BR>

<P>
If either of the last two settings is selected, then basically the DOS application
has direct control over the RTS signal.  If the last option is selected,
then RTS will be turned on by SIO when the DOS program first touches the
comm port.
<P>
If the first option (the default) is selected, then SIO will use RTS as
a handshaking signal.  That is, RTS will be turned off if SIO can not accept
any further receive data.  In addition, if the DOS application program turns
off the virtual RTS signal, VSIO will stop supplying the DOS application
with receive data.
