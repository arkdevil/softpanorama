<P>
"SIO_Share_Access_With_OS/2"  This DOS setting defaults to ON and it applies
to all communications ports used by the DOS session.  When ON, SIO will
allow an OS/2 session to access a communications port which the DOS session
first opened (and has not closed).  If set to OFF, then the DOS session
will have exclusive use of the communications port(s) that it uses.  This
setting does not apply to a second DOS session attempting to access a communications
port,  two different DOS sessions are never allowed to access the same port
at the same time.  Additionally, this setting has no affect upon the access
to a communications port which is first opened by an OS/2 session.
