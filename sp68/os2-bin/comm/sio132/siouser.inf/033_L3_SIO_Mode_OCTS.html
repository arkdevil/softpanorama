<!-- entering slot 33 -->
<P>
"SIO_Mode_OCTS"  This setting specifies how SIO will react to the CTS signal
when transmitting data.  The two available options are:      HandShake Signal,
as in RTS/CTS.
<BR>
     Ignore CTS During Transmit.
<BR>

<P>
If the first option (the default) is selected, then SIO will not transmit
data when the CTS signal is off.  If the second option is selected, then
SIO will ignore CTS during transmit.  Note that this setting should be set
to "Ignore" for 3 wire connections like the Seiko Smart Label Printer, and
Laplink.  VSIO ignores this setting
