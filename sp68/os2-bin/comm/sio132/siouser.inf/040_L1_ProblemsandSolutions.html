<P>
1 -  Port already in use is displayed.
<P>
This message is displayed when the comm port or the IRQ is in use.  If the
comm port is not actually in use, the IRQ is most likely in use.
<P>
2 -  SIO displays a warning message that the IRQ for a port appears to be
wrong, but the port works.
<P>
SIO probably detected more than one IRQ attached to the comm port.  This
indicates a possible hardware problem with your system that you may want
to have checked.
<P>
3 - The modem will not initialize.
<P>
Configure your comm program(s) to insert a delay between modem initialization
characters as they are sent to the modem.
<P>
4 - WinFax locks up during install.
<P>
During the WinFax install, temporarily turn OFF the DOS setting SIO_Virtualize_COM_Ports.
 Once installation is complete, the setting SIO_Virtualize_COM_Ports can
be restored.
<P>
5 - Telemate does not recognize VX00 as a FOSSIL.
<P>
Set the baud rate in Telemate to less than 57600.
<P>
6 -  Comm output is very slow from DOS.
<P>
This is a problem common to many DOS BBS and Door programs. They attempt
to synchronize the local screen with the transmitted data.  That is, they
send a character, wait until it is sent and then display the character on
the local screen.  This does not cause a problem for the single tasking
DOS environment.  However, this procedure causes at least two (probably
more) context switches in the multi- tasking environment of OS2, which in
turn brings the processor to its knees.  One possible solution is for the
programmer to synchronize line by line instead of character by character.

<P>
7 -  FaxWorks' driver FMD.SYS cannot access a comm port when SIO is used,
but works okay with COM.SYS.
<P>
The problem may be that the comm port is in use (often by a DOS program).
 In all cases known to the author, this has
<P>
been the case.  That is, FMD.SYS can not access the port because it is in
use, and FMD.SYS does not report the problem in a manner that is understandable
to many users.
<P>
COM.SYS seems to have a bug that will allow an OS2 device driver (like FMD.SYS)
to use a comm port when it is in use by a another device driver, and it
(COM.SYS) does not cause an error when it should.  The exact conditions
of this is not fully understood by the author and the above supposition
may not be totally correct.
<P>
8 -  Procomm stops receiving
<P>
Procomm seems to have a bug in its implementation of RTS/CTS handshaking.
 The problem shows up most often when Procomm is windowed.  Under certain
conditions, Procomm will turn the virtual RTS OFF and does not turn it ON
again.  This prevents VSIO from sending further data to Procomm if SIO_Mode_RTS
is set for RTS/CTS handshake.  A solution to the problem that seems to work
is to set SIO_Mode_RTS to other than RTS/CTS handshake.  Note that SIO_Mode_RTS
should be set for RTS/CTS handshake under almost all other conditions.
<P>
9 - WinFax does not work well.  a- Connect problems with recipient's fax
station
<BR>

<BR>
 b- Cannot send more than one page of a multiple page fax
<BR>

<BR>
 c- Transmission fails between<!-- entering slot 41 --> pages
<BR>

<BR>
 d- Transmitted pages are corrupted, missing parts, or cut off.

Class 1 FAX modem:  The modem init strings set by WinFax 3.0 will work in
the single-layered comm world of DOS and Windows.  However, these modem
init strings will not work in the multi-layered comm environment used by
OS/2.  Specifically, WinFax 3.0 sets the modem to use only Xon/Xoff flow
control.  Ideally, both Xon/Xoff and Hardware handshaking needs to be set.
 If only one handshake can be set, set the modem to Hardware handshake.
 For USR FAX modems, use &amp;H3, for many other modems, the setting is
&amp;K3.  Additionally, for WinFax 3.04 and up, place the following in your
WINFAX.INI file:
<P>
       HdwFlowControl=1
<P>
Class 2 FAX modem:  It seems to the author that hardware handshake screws
up some (possibly all) class 2 FAX modems. Therefore, when using a class
2 modem, WinFax should be configured to use XON/XOFF handshaking. For WinFax
3.04 and up, place the following in your WINFAX.INI file:
<P>
   HdwFlowControl=0
<P>
The author feels that the inability to use hardware handshake with class
2 FAX modems is a serious design deficiency.
<P>
10 - Serial Printer messes up on last page.
<P>
Add the following command line to your CONFIG.SYS file:
<P>
     RUN=MODE COM1 TO=ON
<P>
