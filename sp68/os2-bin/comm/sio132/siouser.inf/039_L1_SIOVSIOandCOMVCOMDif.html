<P>
What follows is some of the differences between SIO/VSIO and COM/VCOM that
are known to the author.
<P>
1 -  COM.SYS will automatically seek out and support four comm ports, COM1
through COM4.  SIO.SYS will automatically seek out and support only COM1
and COM2. If SIO.SYS is to support more than two comm ports, they must be
defined in the command line that loads SIO.SYS. For example, DEVICE=SIO.SYS
(COM3) (COM4) will cause SIO.SYS to support four comm ports.
<P>
2 -  In the absence of overrides in the command line, COM.SYS will seek
out four comm ports in the sequence of I/O ports 3F8h, 2F8h, 3E8h and 2E8h.
 The first port found in this sequence is given the logical name COM1, the
second is COM2 etc.  This means that the comm port at 2F8h could become
COM1.  In the opinion of the author, this confuses some users to frustration.

<P>
With no command line overrides, SIO.SYS uses a fixed I/O port concept.  That
is, COM1 is always at I/O port 3F8h, COM2 is always at 2F8h, etc.  Another
way of looking at this is;  if no comm port exists at port 3F8h, then you
do not have a COM1.  SIO.SYS will not move another (found) comm port into
the logical COM1 slot.
<P>
3 -  VSIO opens a comm port for a DOS session with sharing allowed.  VCOM
uses an "exclusive use" open for DOS sessions.
<P>
4 -  SIO.SYS always controls the FIFOs of the 16550 UART. SIO.SYS will not
allow an application program (OS2 or DOS) to disable the FIFOs of a real
16550.  The application may specify the transmit fifo load count.
<P>
5 -  SIO.SYS will accept any number between 50 and 115200 (921600 if a Hayes
ESP) as a valid baud rate.  For example, if an application program attempts
to set a baud rate of 9990 bps, COM.SYS will reject it and SIO.SYS will
accept it.
<P>
6 -  SIO/VSIO execute faster than COM/VCOM.  This means that some applications,
that are timing dependent, may not work under SIO/VSIO that do work under
COM/VCOM.
<P>
7 -  VSIO optionally (and by default) simulates a 16550A for DOS sessions.
 VCOM simulates a 8250/16450.
<P>
8 -  SIO/VSIO provides more reliable active flow control for DOS sessions.
 For example, if RTS/CTS handshaking is in use, VSIO processes the RTS settings
by the DOS program while SIO completely controls the real RTS signal.  COM/VCOM
simply passes the RTS signal directly to the hardware.
<P>
9 -  COM.SYS will block an application until a write completes. SIO will
return to the application program immediately if all of the write data will
fit into SIO's internal buffers.
