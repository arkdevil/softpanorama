Extensive testing has been done to insure that this product works on the
widest possible range of OS/2 V2 (and up) systems.  In most cases, problems
can be resolved by reading this manual carefully.
<P>
Registered users of SIO can update to the latest version using the BBS and
its UPDATE command.  All variations (number of ports) of SIO are available
for immediate download from the BBS by registered users.

Support is provided in section 4 of the OS/2 Vendor Forum on CompuServe
(GO OS2BVEN).  Section 4 of the OS2BVEN Forum is dedicated to the support
of SIO.
