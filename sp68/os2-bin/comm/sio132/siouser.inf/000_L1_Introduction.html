<P>
SIO.SYS and VSIO.SYS are companion device drivers for Version 2 (and up)
of the OS/2 operating system.
<P>
Both drivers (SIO/VSIO) have been coded with performance in mind, possibly
sacrificing some compatibility.  For this reason, SIO and VSIO are not exact
replacements for the OS/2 drivers COM and VCOM.  However, all serial communications
programs tested by the author work correctly using SIO/VSIO.
<P>
This manual is intended for the SIO user.  A separate SIO Technical Reference
Manual is included in the distribution zip. The Technical Reference Manual
also documents some advanced options and features that are not documented
here.
<P>
This manual and the software distributed with it is provided with no guarantees.
 Use it at your own risk.
