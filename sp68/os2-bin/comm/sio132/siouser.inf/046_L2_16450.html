<P>
The 16450 seems to be a speeded up version of the 8250A.  There is no direct
way (that I know of) for software to detect the difference between an 8250A
and a 16450.  I believe the 16450 was developed to eliminate the need for
software to insert delays between successive accesses to the device.  The
specifications indicate the 16450 is a much faster device than its predecessors.
The additional speed is only the speed at which the processor can access
the device.  The maximum baud rate for the 16450 is still stated at 56kb.
 However, I have been told by some people that they have run the 16450 successfully
at much higher speeds. I do not believe there was ever a 16450A.
