I am very impressed with the STB 4COM card, they have almost got it.  Yes,
its the same company that makes the VGA cards.  The 4COM card uses a 16554
which is the equivalent of four 16550A. Comm ports can use IRQs 2/9, 3,
4, 5, 10, 11, 12, and 15.  Any or all ports can share IRQs, and they have
done this right.  I tested SIO with all four ports of the 4COM on IRQ12
and they worked correctly.  The user can select any of the following I/O
port address for a comm port: 3F8, 2F8, 3E8, 2E8, 1A8, 1E8, 1F8, 2A8.  The
4COM card is priced at $110 and I ordered mine from Prerapture Solutions
which can be reached by telephone at 1-919-286-1502 for information and
foreign callers.  In the US orders can be placed by calling 1-800-735-5266.
