<P>
OS/2 Version 2.1 introduced limited PCMCIA support which includes PCMCIA
modems.  I am told that the PCMCIA support will be changed in the future,
so the following information may change.
<P>
SIO supports PCMCIA comm ports or modems.  However, several other device
drivers or programs are needed to use a PCMCIA modem under OS/2.  One of
the needed drivers is provided with OS/2 version 2.1 and is called PCMCIA.SYS
which provided "Card Services".
<P>
Another needed driver, "Socket Services", is usually supplied by the computer
manufacturer (or supplier).
<P>
A third driver is usually supplied by the modem manufacture (or supplier).
 This driver is referred to as the "Client Driver" and may also be called
the modem enabler.
<P>
What all of the above boils down to is that these drivers, or their equivalents
are needed to enable the PCMCIA modem.  Once enabled, SIO can then use the
modem.
<P>
The Client Driver (or equivalent) usually allows the modems I/O address
and IRQ to be assigned.  If so, the address and IRQ assigned at the Client
Driver must match an address/IRQ combination for a comm port known to SIO.
 This is not a problem if one is using standard addresses and IRQs for the
comm ports.
<P>
If the OS/2 drivers are not available, you can also try to enable your PCMCIA
modem using a DOS VDM and drivers/programs supplied for DOS.  This has worked
for many users.
