<P>
The basic command line syntax is as follows:
<P>
   DEVICE=SIO.SYS (Cn, An, In, Ig, Fc) [(Cn, An, In, Ig, Fc)]
<P>
Where:
<P>
"Cn" is the comm port number (1 thru 4) or the string COM1 thru COMn.  The
port number may proceeded by an asterisk "*" to indicate that the port may
be used as a PCMCIA comm port (eg *1 or *COM1).  Note that it is normal
for SIO to display a warning about not finding anything at PCMCIA ports.

<P>
"An" is a hexadecimal number that defines the base hardware I/O port address
for the communications port.  If this field is left blank, the default I/O
port address is used for the comm port.  Note that default I/O addresses
exist only for COM1 through COM4 on AT type systems and for COM1 through
COM8 on PS/2 systems.
<P>
"In" is an IRQ number (0 thru 15) or the string IRQ0 thru IRQ15 or the string
NONE.  It is best if one leaves this field blank and allows SIO to determine
the IRQ, see AUTOMATIC IRQ ASSIGNMENT below.  The IRQ choice of NONE is
provided for cards that can work either with or without an IRQ like the
Hayes ESP.
<P>
"Ig" is an ignored parameter.  If exists for compatibility with COM.SYS.

<P>
"Fc" is the Forced 16550A chip parameter.  If an F is placed in this position,
a 16550A UART chip type is forced regardless of the automatically detected
chip type.
