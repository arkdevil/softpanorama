<P>
Only the ESP II is supported, the original ESP (ESP I in many PS/2 systems)
is not supported.  The SIO command line must contain the ESP's enhanced
I/O port address.  For bit rates exceeding 180000bps the IRQ MUST be specified
for the master port. For lower date rates NONE may be specified for the
IRQ. SIO does not search for the ESP ports as the Hayes drivers do under
DOS/Windows.  This searching can (will) break things under OS/2.  The SIO
command line for an ESP at I/O port 180h using IRQ14 would be as follows:

<P>
DEVICE=path\SIO.SYS (COM1,180,IRQ14)
<P>
If you would like the above reflected to DOS sessions as a standard COM1,
then use the following command line:
<P>
DEVICE=path\SIO.SYS (COM1,180:3F8,IRQ14:IRQ4)
<P>
Note that the numbers after the colons ":" are the address and IRQ of where
the port appears to DOS software running under OS/2.
<P>
Any IRQ specified for an ESP slave port is ignored.  For those that like
to have a clean looking CONFIG.SYS, SIO will accept NONE as the IRQ specification
of an ESP slave port.
<P>
If you wish to use the ESP in Compatibility Mode, simply specify the base
port address that the ESP's compatibility mode is configured for (ie 3F8
when configured for COM1).
