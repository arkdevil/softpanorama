<P>
"SIO_Mode_DTR"  This setting has three options that specify how SIO and
VSIO are to treat the DTR signal.  The there available option are:      No
Change at OPEN or CLOSE.
<BR>
     Turn ON at OPEN, OFF at CLOSE.
<BR>
     HandShake Signal, as in DTR/DSR.
<BR>

<P>
If either of the first two settings is selected, then basically the DOS
application has direct control over the DTR signal.  If the second option
is selected, then DTR will be turned on by SIO when the DOS program first
touches the comm port.
<P>
If the third option is selected, then SIO will use DTR as a handshaking
signal.  That is, DTR will be turned off if SIO can not accept any further
receive data.  In addition, if the DOS application program turns off the
Virtual DTR, VSIO will stop supplying the DOS application with receive data.
