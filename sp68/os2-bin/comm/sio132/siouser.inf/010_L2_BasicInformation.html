<P>
The command line options are included in the command line that loads SIO
in the CONFIG.SYS file.  VSIO has no command line options.  Command line
options are usually grouped by port within parenthesis.
<P>
If you use only COM1 and/or COM2, at the standard IRQ and port addresses,
you will not need any command line options.  However, up to four serial
communications ports, COM1 thru COM4, can be specified at any base port
address and any IRQ.  On PS/2 systems and some ISA cards, SIO/VSIO supports
multiple communications devices sharing the same IRQ.
