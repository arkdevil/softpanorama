<P>
"SIO_Virtualize_16550A"  This DOS setting defaults to ON and it applies
to all communications ports used by the DOS session.  When ON, VSIO will
simulate a 16550A.  When OFF, VSIO will simulate a 16450.  Some DOS programs
may not work when a 16550A is simulated.  Turning this setting off may allow
the program to work (but slower).
