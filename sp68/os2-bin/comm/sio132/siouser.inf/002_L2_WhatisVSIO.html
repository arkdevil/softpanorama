<P>
VSIO is a Virtual Device Driver (VDD).  Virtual device drivers provide services
for DOS programs executing under OS/2.  Most Virtual Device Drivers emulate
a specific hardware device and/or BIOS service.  The primary job of a Virtual
Device Driver is to convert misbehaved DOS input/output into well behaved
input/output that can be accepted by the OS/2 driver SIO.SYS.
<P>
Using the protection mechanism of the 386 (and up) processor, a Virtual
Device Driver can instruct OS/2 to trap all input/output for given hardware
ports.  Once trapped, the Virtual Device Driver (VDD) appropriately routes
information to/from the Physical Device Driver (PDD) and to/from the DOS
program.
<P>
VSIO creates a virtual (imaginary) 16550A or 16450 (UART) in software.  Additionally
VSIO emulates the BIOS INT 14h services. All of the hardware registers of
the virtual UART are simulated by VSIO.  VSIO does not attempt to simulate
the timing of the real UARTs.  DOS programs that depend on the timing of
real hardware UARTs may have problems executing under VSIO.
<P>
All DOS programs that execute under VSIO should have RTS/CTS handshaking
enabled (in the application) even if SIO proper is not using RTS/CTS handshake.

<P>
The virtualization (simulation) provided by VSIO is not (and can not be)
exact.  However, most well written DOS programs should not have problems.

<P>
VSIO will only work with SIO installed and the versions of SIO/VSIO must
match.  If VSIO refuses to install, you most likely have a version mismatch
or COM.SYS is still installed.  VSIO will not work with any other device
driver like COM.SYS.
