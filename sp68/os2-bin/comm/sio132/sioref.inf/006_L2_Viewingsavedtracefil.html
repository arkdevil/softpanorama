<P>
VIEWPMLM.EXE may be used to view trace files created by PMLM. VIEWPMLM.EXE
requires one parameter, the trace file name.  The user can use the keys
UP, DOWN, PAGEUP, PAGEDOWN, HOME, and END to navigate the saved trace file.
 Registered SIO users may freely distribute VIEWPMLM.EXE (along with saved
trace files) to anyone for technical support purposes.
<P>
VIEWPMLM can be used in native DOS, in DOS sessions under OS/2, and in OS/2
sessions.  This means that even those developers and support people need
not have OS/2 to view the captured communications data created by PMLM.
