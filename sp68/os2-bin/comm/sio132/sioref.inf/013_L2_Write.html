<P>
If another write is already in progress, the process issuing the additional
write is blocked (suspended) until the previous write command completes.
 When a write is started, that write is not interrupted by additional writes.
 If multiple writes are issued, they are not necessarily processed in the
order they were issued. Thus, applications may not see the write requests
complete in the order in which they were issued.
<P>
The conditions that control when the write will complete are controlled
by the current DCB when the write is started.
