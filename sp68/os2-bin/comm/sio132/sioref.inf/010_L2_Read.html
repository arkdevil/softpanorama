<P>
If another read is already in progress, the process issuing the additional
read is blocked (suspended) until the previous read command completes.  When
a read is started, that read is not interrupted by additional reads.  If
multiple reads are issued, they are not necessarily processed in the order
they were issued. Thus, applications may not see the read requests complete
in the order in which they were issued.
<P>
The conditions that control when the read will complete are controlled by
the active (current) DCB when the read is started.
