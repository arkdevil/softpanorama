It is hard to find a 16550 (Non A).  I was told by National Semiconductor
that they did everything they could to get all 16550s back.  SIO will detect
a 16550 and tell you if you have one.  I am told that the 16550 was installed
in early PS/2 systems.  The 16550 was the first shot at a FIFOed version
of the 8250 family from National semiconductor.  However, I was told by
National Semiconductor that the FIFOs of the 16550 are not reliable and
they should not be enabled.  SIO will treat a 16550 like a 16450.  In this
mode, they are reliable.  National Semiconductor would not provide me with
a specification for the 16550.  However, I suspect its maximum baud rate
is the same as the 16550A which is 256kb.
