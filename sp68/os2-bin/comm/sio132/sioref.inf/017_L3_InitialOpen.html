<P>
The IRQ associated with the comm port is claimed (taken) when the Initial
Open occurs.  If the associated IRQ is not available a "Port in Use" error
is returned.  At the time of this writing, the IRQ is claimed allowing sharing.
 However, the shared IRQ claiming is done to circumvent anomalies in the
OS, and in actuality SIO will not concurrently share an IRQ with another
device driver.  The author found it necessary to claim (reset) all interrupts
directed to the interrupt service routine in order to prevent lock ups of
a communications port.  The IRQ mess may be cleaned up at a future date
when the OS problems are corrected.
<P>
During Initial Opens, DTR and RTS are set in accordance with the current
Device Control Block (DCB) settings.  If DTR Control Mode is the "Enabled"
option ( bits 1 and 0 of the DCB Flags1 byte equal 01), then DTR is turned
on.  Otherwise, DTR is unchanged by the Initial Open.  Similarly, if RTS
Control Mode is the "Enabled" option ( bits 7 and 6 of the DCB Flags1 byte
equal 01), then RTS is turned on.  Otherwise, RTS is unchanged by the Initial
Open.
<P>
The following actions also occur during an Initial Open:    The Xon and
Xoff characters are set to 11h and 13h
<BR>
   respectively.
<BR>

<P>
   The transmit and receive buffers and structures are cleared
<BR>
   and re-initialized.
<BR>

<P>
   Status bits are reset.

If the Initial Opener is an OS/2 process (not a DOS process) then the Read
time out processing is set to "Normal" in the current DCB.
