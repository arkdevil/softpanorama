<P>
"SIO Event Word" is a bit flag.  The bits have the following meaning:  
Bit 0 -  Set when a receive character is transferred from
<BR>
        the UART to the receive buffer.
<BR>
   Bit 1 -  Set when a receive (Read) timeout occurs.
<BR>
   Bit 2 -  Set if the transmit buffer is empty.
<BR>
   Bit 3 -  Set if Clear To Send (CTS) has changed state.
<BR>
   Bit 4 -  Set if Data Set Ready (DSR) has changed state.
<BR>
   Bit 5 -  Set if Data Carrier Detect (DCD) has changed
<BR>
        state.
<BR>
   Bit 6 -  Set if a break has been detected.
<BR>
   Bit 7 -  Set if a framing, parity, or overrun error has
<BR>
        occurred.
<BR>
   Bit 8 -  Set if trailing edge of Ring Indicator (RI) has
<BR>
        occurred.
<BR>
   Bits 9-15 Reserved, set to zero by SIO.
<BR>

<P>
All bits are reset prior to returning to the caller.
