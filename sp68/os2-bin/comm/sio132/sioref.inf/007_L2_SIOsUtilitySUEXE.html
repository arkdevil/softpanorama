This utility program has several useful commands.  You can obtain a list
of the available commands by typing SU at any command line prompt without
any parameters.  One very useful command is SU IRQS.  This command will
show IRQs that are currently free for use.  Commands are provided allowing

a wealth of diagnostic information.  Some command line examples follow:
