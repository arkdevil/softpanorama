<P>
SIO is a Serial Input/Output (SIO) communications driver.  It provides an
interface between application programs and the serial communications hardware.

<P>
SIO had been designed as a high performance replacement for the OS/2 device
driver COM.SYS.  See the Technical Reference Manual for information about
the known differences between COM.SYS and SIO.SYS.
<P>
SIO works with 8250 (type) serial I/O devices.  Such devices include, but
are not limited to the 8250A, 16450, 16550, 16550A and the 82510.  If you
have a PC that is an IBM or near compatible which has a serial communication
port, it is likely that it contains one of these devices.  In addition,
SIO supports some intelligent serial I/O cards.  See "Intelligent Cards
Supported" for additional information.  SIO will identify the type of serial
devices that it finds and display them at load time.
<P>
Like other Device Drivers, SIO will do very little standing alone.  There
must be an application(s) program that makes use of SIO's functions before
one will benefit from SIO.
