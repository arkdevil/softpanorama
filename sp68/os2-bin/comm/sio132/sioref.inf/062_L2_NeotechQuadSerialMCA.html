Well, I just got my first PS/2 system (for testing of SIO) and I am using
the NeoTech Quad Serial card in that system.  What can I say, it works beautifully
and interrupt sharing has never been a problem on MCA systems.  This card
(as shipped) came with four individual 16450 chips installed, but they were
in sockets so I installed 16550 UARTs before I installed the card.  The
card has one large connector on the back of the card and the supplied cable
expands that to 4 standard DB-25 connectors.  Those of you needing a good
4 port card for an MCA system contact:    Neotech Inc
