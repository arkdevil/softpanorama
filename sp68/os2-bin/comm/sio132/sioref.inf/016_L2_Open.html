There are basically two kinds of open.  They are an Initial Open and Additional
(shared) Opens. The IBM documentation calls the initial open a First Level
Open.  An Initial Open is an open that occurs when no other process has
the communications port open. An Additional Open is when an open occurs
and another process already has the communications port open.  For an Additional
Open to occur, the Initial Opener must have issued an open allowing shared
access to the port.
