The following is a collection of comments developed from hearsay, random
documents, experience, and technical specifications. So, take it with a
grain of salt.  Order information from the various manufactures if you want
accurate information.
<P>
Very good reference books are available from National Semiconductor Corporation.
 They cover most of the SIO devices (also called UARTs) that you will find
in many PCs and clones.  I am not sure that books can be ordered directly
from National semiconductor. They may require that you get it from a distributor.
 In any case, the address on the back of the one manual is:    National
Semiconductor Corporation
