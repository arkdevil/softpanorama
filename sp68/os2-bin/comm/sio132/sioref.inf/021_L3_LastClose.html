<P>
The last close occurs when a process issues a close and no other process
has the communications port open.  If there are any writes pending or incomplete,
the process is blocked (suspended) until the writes complete or time out.
 If 60 seconds pass with no activity at the communications port, the port
is forced to close and all writes are terminated.  If any processes are
blocked (suspended) waiting on a read, they are forced to return to the
process that issued the read.
<P>
If either DTR Control Mode or RTS Control Mode are set to "Enabled" by the
current DCB, then the appropriate signal(s) is turned off.
<P>
Finally, the IRQ is released back to the OS.
