            47h - Hold Transmit
<P>
Parameter Packet - None
<P>
Data Packet - None
<P>
This function will disable the transmitter.  The transmitter will not be
enabled again unless IOCtl function 48h is issued.  If the transmitter is
already disabled, this call has no effect.
<P>
This function can be used as part of a set that allows an application to
implement its own Xon/Xoff type handshaking.
<P>
Note that this is different from how COM.SYS implements this function.  COM.SYS
will re-enable the transmitter if an Xon is received while SIO will not.
