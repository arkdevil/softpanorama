Documentation of software is often more difficult than writing the program
itself (at least it is for this author).  I will do my best though.  But
who do I document for?  The user that is setting up a BBS just wants to
get SIO installed and to move on to more important things.  The user that
is having problems needs information about serial I/O communications in
general and the PC specifically. The application developer (programmer)
needs detailed information about each individual function and the information
generated.  The answer is, more than one manual is needed.  This manual
is intended as a reference for use by application programmers that desires
to use SIO.  A separate Users Manual is included in the distribution file(s).
 This manual and the software described is provided as is and with no guarantees.
 Use at your own risk.
