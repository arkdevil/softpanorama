As best that I know, the 8250 was the first SIO chip (integrated circuit)
that was used by the IBM PC and many clones.  In my opinion, it was a poor
choice on the part of IBM.  I feel many superior devices, at comparable
prices, were readily available. At that time, I feel the 8251A or the 8530
would have been better choices.  But, they used the 8250 and therefore we
must use it.  From a hardware standpoint the 8250 is a relatively slow device.
It is advisable that programmers not perform successive inputs or outputs
to this device.  It seems that software programs can load the various registers
of the 8250 faster than it can process the information.  The 8250 had a
total of 7 registers.  The specifications state that 56kb is the maximum
baud rate.
