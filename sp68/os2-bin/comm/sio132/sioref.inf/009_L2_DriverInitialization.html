<!-- entering slot 9 -->
<P>
During device driver initialization the command line is parsed, memory for
data and control buffers is allocated and the system environment is examined.

<P>
Buffers are allocated for the maximum number of ports that the installed
version of SIO can support (up to 16).
<P>
The mouse port is determined and if it is a serial mouse, that port is excluded
from use by SIO.
<P>
In the absence of any command line parameters, SIO will only support (look
for) COM1 and COM2 at the standard addresses.  COM3 and up will not be supported
(or looked at) unless they are specifically identified in the SIO command
line.
