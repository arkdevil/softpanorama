In OS/2, each icon represents an object of some sort. For data and 
program objects, there are extended attributes which are stored on disk. 
So, when you open a folder in OS/2, the system has to go to the disk and 
read those extended attributes - which may include the icons you see. 
Windows is not object-oriented, so doesn't have this overhead. On 
balance, the additional function OS/2 provides (which Windows users can 
take a while to discover, as Windows has not prepared them for it!) makes 
up for the slower population of folders. 

Now.....that changes in WARP. Warp populates folders much more quickly 
than OS/2 2.x. 

OS/2 2.x also has a 16-bit implementation of Presentation Manager (the 
GUI). This means that it must be "thunked" to 32-bit - with the overheads 
that entails. 

WARP resolves this by having a greatly enhanced (speed-wise) 32-bit 
implementation of Presentation Manager. A build later than the WARP Beta 
II looks faster on my 386DX/40 at home than OS/2 2.11 does on my system at 
work, for example, which is a 486DX2/50. 

OS/2 is also much more efficient - and pro-active - about managing memory 
than Windows. So, OS/2 is always moving things in and out of real memory 
- freeing up and allocating real RAM - in a way that Windows users will 
not be familiar with. It also helps if you have optimised your settings 
for Windows apps. If they don't use XMS and EMS, then set those to zero 
for your Windows environment. This will reduce swapping. 

OS/2 uses 4Kb pages of memory, while my understanding is that Windows 
uses 64Kb pages of memory. I hope someone will correct me if I am wrong.

This would eat more memory than you think. Each file/direcotory/program 
object can have up to 64Kb of Extended Attributes. Your 8MB would not 
last very long if all that was kept in RAM. As it is, WARP will read in 
the info on the objects that can be displayed in an open Window. If you 
scoll the Window, it will load more info - being careful to page out 
what is not likely to be used.

HPFS is faster than FAT for partitions under 80MB in size. It also offers 
better use of disk space than FAT (512 byte clusters as opposed to 2048 
bytes minimum for FAT). HPFS is indexed and file location is optimised - 
while FAT is niether. 

Pre-emptive multi-tasking isn't faster for one app - but should show 
greater throughput across a selection of simultaneously running 
applications - provided they aren't all in the same Windows session. 

I measure the WPS in absolute rather than relative terms: 

It may be slightly slower than Windows for some things (I'm talking about 
OS/2 2.x here) in a relative way.....but in absolute terms, I find it 
more than fast enough for the work I do. For exmaple, A Ferrari would be 
faster than my Mitsubishi Lancer station wagon....but not nearly as 
useful to me for what I do. 

With OS/2, I don't need 50+ program groups as the WPS allows me to 
organise my apps on the Launchpad and in folders much more efficiently 
than that. 

I hate Program Manager. I really do. I find myself in a Windows-only 
situation every couple of months and - fast or not - Program Manager is 
an inflexible pain in my butt. 

The good news is that the next release of OS/2 is *almost* here......so 
close!......and it deals seriously with every issue you raise. The issues 
you raise never bothered me much, but for you it sounds like the answer
is WARP. You'll like it.
