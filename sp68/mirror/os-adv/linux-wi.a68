Matt, don't be baited.  The poster is clearly clueless.  It is true that Unix
software tends to be hard to support, hard to find, and more expensive than
Windows or DOS-based counterparts.  But this isn't the decisive factor for a
lot of folks.

Again, I don't see how the stuff that's available for Linux can be compared
to what there is for Windows or DOS (not that this stuff is much good, ei-
ther - in fact, it's pretty funny how a lot of DOS software comes with manu-
als so incomplete and badly written that you have to go out and buy a book
guide just to figure out what is going on).  Personally, I prefer the Linux
on-line stuff, but that's not for everyone.

I'm not sure you can say that Linux multimedia support, or international-
ization, or many other things, are as good as what you'd find on a Mac or
under DOS/Windows.  I'm particularly cognizant of the fact that Linux has
no fully internationalized word processing, like what we find in MLS for
DOS, or NISUS for the Mac, etc.  But what is the point of Linux?  Is it
supposed to be another DOS?  Don't think so.  It's a traditional Unix
kernel for traditional Unix uses - software development, TCP/IP, file
servers, mail routers, etc.

If someone wants to do word processing, then Linux clearly isn't the first
choice.  TeX is an 80s-style typesetter.  Like looking at WordPerfect in
"reveal codes" mode :-).  Sure you can get WordPerfect for Linux, but this
isn't even the lead version (6.0).  Under Windows or on a Mac you just plug
in MS-Word or whatever and go.  And the Andrew editor, well, let's just say
that it is minimal - nothing like the systems you can get for DOS/Win/Mac.

Doesn't mean I'll trash my Linux partition, which has too many other uses.
I just don't know how, for example, anyone could choose DOS or Windows as
their development environment.

Well, there's is LaTeX2e and LaTeX2e is clearly NOT an 80s-style
typesetter. It's a 90s-style typegrapher.
