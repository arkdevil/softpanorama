Explanation of names of zipped files for 1993 Issue 7 and later:

  DSNymA = Developer Support News 199y issue m ASCII (plain-text)
  DSNymI = Developer Support News 199y issue m .INF  (use OS/2 VIEW)
  DSNymP = Developer Support News 199y issue m .PS   (PostScript)

where y = last digit of year (3, 4, ...)
      m = issue number represented as alpha (A=1, ..., G=7, H=8, ...)

For example, DSN3GI is 1993 issue 7, the 15 October issue, in .INF
format (after being unzipped).
