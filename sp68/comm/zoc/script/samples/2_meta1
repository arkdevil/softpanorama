// DEMONSTRATING METAS
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// A meta is a piece of program, that contains another
// piece of program. 
// you can think of it as a variable or macro.

// Every meta has a name and a value.
// To access the value of a meta, write it's name
// between two percent characters.

// Print the current date and time
writeln "%date%"
writeln "%time%"

// If you like (or need) you may change the value-expansion
// character
meta $
writeln "$date$"
writeln "$time$"

// But I like the % character best, so change it back.
meta %

// A very important system meta is lastline.
// It contains the value after waiting for something, contains
// a parameter if called from dial oder script, or it contains the
// result of some script commands.
// So: Whenever you expect data from somewhere look for it in %lastline%

ask "Type something (or press ESC)"
writeln "You typed '%lastline%'"

request "What do you want?" "Wine" "Women" "Song"
notify "Sorry, I have no '%lastline%'"
