-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. ABOUT THIS VERSION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    This is a probably the last version before V2.0 which is scheduled
    for the third quarter of 1994


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    2. DISTRIBUTION, COPYRIGHT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    ZOC is shareware, (C) 1993, 1994 by Markus Schmidt 

    You may use and test this software for 30 days, then you have
    to register or remove it from your system.

    No warranty of any kind can be given for damage caused through 
    ZOC directly or indirectly or any other way. 

    ZOC may be distributed freely via telecommunication, shareware
    dealers or as a free add on for hard- or software products in form
    of an unmodified ZIP archive, or as unzipped files in an single 
    directory with the name ZOC and with no file added, removed or 
    modified.

    The following restrictions apply to distribution.

     * ZOC must not be used in an army environment or for purposes 
       that are related to military or arms production.

     * ZOC must not be sold as shareware for more than $5/DM 7
       (that includes shipping). If you purchased ZOC from a dealer
       paying more (or get knowledge of such a dealer), notify him 
       of this regulation.

     * ZOC must not be bundled with any Microsoft(+) product.




-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    3. INSTALLATION/REINSTALLATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Unpacking the ZIP file:
    -----------------------

    If you use PKUNZIP, you need to unpack the ZIP file with the -d
    option. This should create a directory structure like this.

        .\ZOC\OPTIONS
        .\ZOC\SCRIPT
        .\ZOC\LOG
        .\ZOC\UPLOAD
        .\ZOC\DOWNLOAD

    If you get a new version of ZOC and want to install it over
    your existing one, you should not overwrite the following
    files (most unpackers will prompt you for permission to 
    overwrite a file):

        .\ZOC\PHONEBK          (your phone book)
        .\ZOC\OPTIONS\*        (your option files)

    All other files should be replaced (maybe except .\SCRIPT\XDIAL
    and .\SCRIPT\QUEDIAL if you changed them manually).




-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    4. ZOC PRIMER
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    There are a few things you should know about ZOC before you
    begin. These things are also described in the help file, but you
    might run into problems before you find them there.


    Registration/Orders:
    --------------------

    If you need any information about ordering and registration see
    Help for Registration in the help menu of ZOC. 

    Here's a quick summary:

    As you already might know, ZOC is a shareware program. During
    the beta phase I had some lively discussions about 'crippling' (how
    I hate that word) shareware. Early versions of ZOC had a restriction
    in the ZModem download that was removed as a result of these dis-
    cussions. Now the order form is shown after download.

    If you want to register, just fill out the order form and send me a 
    hardcopy. You find my address and prices in the helpfile. 

    Even in times in which the world is called a 'global village' it is
    quite a bit hard to transfer money from the United States to Germany.
    Methods of payment are described in the helpfile - the easiest way 
    to register is using the Compuserve shareware registration feature
    (which, of course, requires that you have a Compuserve account).
    It is also described in the helpfile.



    If you have problems:
    ---------------------

    Everything important is in the helpfile. Select 'contents' from
    the help menu or press the help button in the dialog windows.

    Also check the 'common problems' section before contacting me.



    Starting ZOC:
    -------------

    ZOC needs a parameter to tell it which com port to use (check the
    help file for a more detailed discussion of these parameters). 

      ZOC [/M] [/U] [/S:<script>] [/W:<width>] [/H:<height>] [COMx] 
          [/C] [/CP:<codepage>]

    If you do not want to enter the com parameter every time you start 
    ZOC you can set an evironment variable in your CONFIG.SYS or 
    STARTUP.CMD

      SET ZOCDEVICE=COMx 

    If no com port is given via parameter or environment variable,
    ZOC scans for a free com port and uses the first available port. 



    Startup files:
    --------------

    When ZOC is started it searches two files for automatic processing:

        .\OPTIONS\STANDARD    (default options file)
        .\SCRIPT\STARTUP      (sort of autoexec script)



    Changes, new features:
    ----------------------

    If you get a new version of ZOC look into the VERSIONS.DOC file
    for new features, changes and fixed bugs. Especially looking at
    the new features might show you functions that you might otherwise 
    miss because the description is buried somewhere in the helpfile
    (and no one reads the entire helpfile each time a new version 
    appears).



    Startup window:
    ---------------

    Getting rid of this window is easy. Go to the command prompt and
    rename or delete the README.DOC file.




-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    5. TAP_GIF.EXE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    TAP_GIF.EXE is an online gif viewer for downloads. It was written
    by a friend of mine, using the developer interface (see below) of 
    ZOC. 
    It can be started manually before, or automatically at the begin 
    of a GIF download (even if downloaded via external protocol (see 
    PIPCISB.DLL)).

    It is quite self explanatory. If you have questions about it,
    write to M.GOEMMEL@MSN.RMI.DE




-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    6. PIPCISB.DLL/PIPKERM.DLL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    ZOC contains an interface for implementation of sophisticated 
    external file transfer protocols. Two such protocols are bundled 
    with the ZOC package:

        PIPCIS.DLL     (an implementation of the Compuserve B+ protocol
                        written by M.Goemmel).

        PIPKERM.DLL    (an implementation of the Kermit Protocol
                        written by M.Goemmel).

    If you have questions about them, write to M.GOEMMEL@MSN.RMI.DE




-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    7. Phone book converters/ZOC related files
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    There already is a phone book converter (from Telix and Telemate)
    to ZOC (ZOCBKxxx.ZIP).

    Others will show up and the ZOCDEV.ZIP (developer info) file contains
    a skeleton C source for such a converter.

    The converter and other ZOC related files will be made available
    on the support bbs (see below) and on Compuserve.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    8. Developer infomation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    If you are interested in developing add ins for ZOC you should
    try to find a version of ZOCDEV.ZIP (e. g. from Compuserve).

    This file contains everything (including sample source code) needed
    for developing TAPs (file transfer add ons) or PIPs (file transfer
    protocols).

    If you plan to implement the terminal side of PIPs or TAPs, you
    can request the source code used for servicing these from me. It
    would be a big step forward if the OS/2 family would have a 
    standard for external protocols (like XPR for the Amiga world).



-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    9. A few requests to the OS/2 community
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    There are a few things that I would like to ask you for:

    1. Please distribute this program. I upload current versions only
       to Compuserve and not everyone does have an account there.

    2. If you find spelling errors or odd sentences, please send me
       a mail. English is not my native languange.

    3. Are you interested in promoting the PIP/TAP interface and
       do you want to play the 'host of truth' for them?
       OS/2 needs a sophisticated standard for external protocols
       (that does not mean that PIP/TAP already provides this).
    


    I HOPE YOU ENJOY USING ZOC

    Yours,

        Markus Schmidt
