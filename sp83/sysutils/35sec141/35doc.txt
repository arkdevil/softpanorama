  _NOTE:_ This program is compatible with enhanced mode Windows 3.1 and 
Windows95. (Even when Virtual memory is enabled.) 
  Common knowledge says, that it is possible to speed-up installation process 
of big programs by copying installation disks on hard-drive. It's good thing 
to do, because when you speed-up installation two times (by this trick), you 
can save up-to half an hour. (Yes. There are programs, which took 60 minutes 
to install.) 
  35sec package offers something even better: With 35sec floppy-disk 
accelerator it is possible to read/write floppy-disks on background - You'll 
save even more time and you will not need any hard-disk space. 
  And 35sec provides even more... 
  You are working in your favourite text editor, when friend comes with 1.44MB 
of texts, you are interested in. You will not stop working with text-editor, 
you just press some sequence of key combinations (^^A 1 in case that disk fits 
into A:) and continue working with editor. Disk is being read on background. 
After 35 seconds, computer beeps, indicating you that disk's memory image is 
ready. Now you can decide, if you want to see that texts (access to them is 
now as extremely fast - as fast as ram-drive). If you decide to do some 
changes, you can, but before removing floppy you need to save them back. You 
can do also other things: for example you can make diskcopy of that disk 
without need to read it again.

                  The ultimate floppy-disk caching program 
                                       
  35sec disk accelerator is able to read floppy disks completely on 
background. It is nice feature, which can save you lot of time. Computer is 
slowed down only by some 10%, difference is unnoticeable (when not running 
benchmarks). You can even remove floppy from drive (if disk is error-free). 
You can work on it, and it is as fast as ram-drive. You can even make changes 
on it. Than you can write memory image onto floppy, you can decide to discard 
changes, can make copies of that disk, everything completely on background. 
  When there are some problems with reading floppy, remember to leave it 
inserted in drive. When 35sec is not able to read something (it will tell you 
after reading), you should leave floppy inserted. BIOS may still be able to 
read that data. Be sure to retire such floppies, as they became slow and 
unreliable. 
			 
                          Warning about bad discs  
                          ════════════════════════╝
  Please be carefull when using 35sec with bad disks (disks that are not read 
completely). In case 35sec can not read entire floppy, it reads only its 
parts, and when data are requested from unreadable part, it tries to read them 
through bios. So if operation is done but with errors, be sure _not_ _to_ 
_remove_ floppy from drive. 

                             35sec.com - kernel  
                             ═══════════════════╝
  35sec.com should be loaded from your autoexec.bat file. It is resident and 
takes about 3KB of RAM. It may be loaded high by your memory manager in order 
to save memory. 35sec.com contains kernel, which is responsible for doing all 
low-level operations. This kernel provides services to other programs from 
35sec package. Interface between 35sec.com and other programs is described in 
35tech.txt. If you decide to use that interface, please let me know. Note, 
that you can't distribute 35sec along with your own programs (see 35lic.txt). 

                   35secW.com - Windows compatible kernel  
                   ═══════════════════════════════════════╝
  35secW.com is equivalent of 35sec.com, except that it is compatible with 
enhanced mode Windows. 
  35secW requires mem.386 VxD to be running on machine, and requires 
Microsoft's VFD to be replaced by slightly modified version of VFD (3.1) or 
Standart Floppy disk controller to be disabled (95). See instalation section 
for details. 35secW no longer works under DOS. If you want to use 35sec under 
both DOS and Windows, you have to load both 35sec and 35secW. 35secW is no 
longer compatible with Standard mode Windows. 

                      35cache?.com - cache interfaces  
                      ════════════════════════════════╝
  After loading 35sec.com, you need some program to call its services. You can 
select from 3 versions of this program (called 35caches.com, 35cacheo.com and 
35cacheb.com). All these shells should be loaded from autoexec.bat. They have 
all same keyboard controlls - they differs only in responses they give to you. 
You can even decide not to install 35cache? and control 35sec from command 
line using 35mon, but it is not really comfortable and it is slow. 
  _35cacheb.com_ - gives information by beeps. Problem about this is, that it 
may be hard to recognize what information does it want to give you. Generally, 
two same beeps mean that something is O.K. and accepted, two (or more) 
different beeps mean that something went wrong. It is the smallest one. 
  _35caches.com_ - gives information in text form only. Window in center of 
screen pops up informing you on what happend. Then, you are expected to press 
any key to continue. The message pops up even if you are in graphics mode (and 
you will not be able to see it), so this is not recommended to install when 
you use graphics mode application frequently. 
  _35cacheo.com_ - gives information by beeps and in text form. Text message 
appears after you press report last message (^^C) combination (see below), so 
there are no problems with graphics modes. 
  All 35cache? programs require parameters: you have to specify what shifts do 
you want to use. I recomend you to use 35cache? ac to select Alt+Control+???? 
as hotkey. Run 35cache? without parameters to get help.

  Well, few more comments about commands. ^^V (Cancel current operation) has a 
little bit problems: First cancel operation, _then_ remove floppy from drive. 
  For ilustrative pictures, run README.bat. 

                                   35mon  
                                   ══════╝
  35mon is event-driven utility that allows you to view state of 35sec floppy 
accelerator. It can send commands to 35sec, so you could use instead of 
35cache? interfaces. It can be controlled from command line, use 35mon /? to 
get help. Mount and UnMount batches are examples of 35mons usage. 

                                   35monW  
                                   ═══════╝
  35monW is interface for usage of 35secW under Windows. It is pretty self 
explanatory, I hope. Remember to select buffers between starting operations. I 
hope incompatibility with virtual memory is not really critical - you don't 
need much memory when installing new software (that is probably best time to 
use 35secW).   
                             eXtended Disk Copy  
                             ═══════════════════╝
  eXtended Disk Copy (XDC) allows you to copy floppies (as it's name implies), 
but it is not its main purpose - 35cache can do that to. It can copy floppies 
to files and can work with 35sec floppy images. 
  eXtended Disk Copy to copy files from/to: 

Standart disks  (A:)
Files           (C:\TMP\IMAGE.DAT)
35sec's buffers (1:)
  As an example of using XDC, I prepared a batch file ( empty.bat ) which will 
create empty 1.44MB floppy image for you into buffer 1. You can copy files 
onto it (works like ramdrive), but if you decide to, you can save it on floppy 
( ^^F 1 to save it onto A:). And you can even save only changed areas (using 
^^D 1 to save onto A:). 
  Note that you can create your own images of empty diskettes using xdc A: 
{filename} /1 , images of full floppys by xdc A: {filename} . Such images are 
then used in way similar to empty.bat : xdc {filename} {buffer_number}: [/1] . 

                               Compatibility  
                               ══════════════╝
  35sec is compatible with FDformat/FDread . It is not compatible with 
programs that use other sector size than 512 bytes (such as 2M package). 
  35sec requires 386SX or better, with FDC compatible to my FDC, just try it 
(no-name computers are probably O.K.). Requirement of 386+ is not essential, 
but I'm too lazy to do 32-bit aritmetics on 286-. If that is problem for you 
(i.e. you own 286 or even XT), please let me know, but I don't think I'll help 
you. 
  Please do NOT use 35sec for disks with non-DOS file system (like LINUX 
disks), it can cause 'Division by zero' in foreground application. 

                                Installation  
                                ═════════════╝
  Copy all files to hard-drive. Install 35sec.com and one of 35cache?.com 
(you'll need shift keys, ac is default) in autoexec.bat file. 35sec.com 
(and/or 35secW, if you are windows user) must be loaded after XMS memory 
manager and before any inteligent disk-cache program. 

                          Windows 3.1 installation  
                          ─────────────────────────┘
  35secW requires mem.386 VxD (it will load automagicaly) to be running on 
machine, and requires Microsoft's VFD to be replaced by slightly modified 
version of VFD. 
That is done by replacing 
device=*vfd 
line in system.ini file with 
device=c:\some...path...\vfd.386 


                          Windows 95 installation  
                          ────────────────────────┘
  Under Windows95, you must disable "Standart Floppy disk controller" virtual 
device and place 35secw.COM into Ios.ini file. To do this: 
  1. Double-click 'My computer', double-click 'Control Panel', double-click 
'System', click 'Device manager', expand 'Floppy disk controllers' group, 
double-click 'Standard Floppy Disk Controller'. Unmark 'Device usage' in all 
configurations. 
  Then open notepad, open 'IOS.INI' and add two lines " 35secW " and " 35sec " 
just below [SafeList] line.

                                Registration  
                                ═════════════╝
  After 21 days evalution period, you must register. Registration means, that 
you will send me $10 and I will send you registered copy of 35sec accelerator. 
(Just put money into envelope so they are not visible from outside and send it 
to my snail-mail adress. Send me note if you are able to. Or do you have some 
better idea how to deliver me $10?) By registering, you allow me to create new 
versions and other (hopefully good) programs. 
  After registering, you'll get much smaller version (even with smaller 
resident kernel). Pause on start-up will disappear, too. 
  Note for people from Czech republic: Vzhledem k tomu, ze od nikoho z vas

                     Note for *really* advanced hackers  
                     ═══════════════════════════════════╝
 If you'll successfully crack 35sec.com and if you tell me about it, you may 
                      become registered user of 35sec. 

                                  Versions  
                                  ═════════╝
  There are 3 separate versions of 35sec - first for usage under DOS, second 
for use under Windows (w/o virtual memory, w/o dos boxes) and third 
(registered) version for both environments.
