Created in cooperation with Jirka Hajek 
FastUtility: package of programs, which can do most actions faster than 
ordinary DOS programs. This package contains FastDEL/FastUnDEL programs, which 
works some 10 times faster and are even safer. Other programs include 
FastCOPY, FastMove, FastFIND, and few other utilities, which are not Fast, but 
are also useful - Device (loading device drivers from command line), KeyPress, 
KbdBuff, and more. fueng220.zip

This program allows you to search for stealth viruses. (Stealth viruses are 
viruses, that try to hide themselves. Most modern & successfull viruses are 
stealth. If stealth virus attacks file, and expands it by 500 bytes, after dir 
you will not see that change - virus is hidden. This is dangerous because most 
antivirus programs are not able to find them.) asteal21.zip

                               Reminder V1.00

                               AnswerIt V1.00  
                               ═══════════════╝
Windows ask you many questions, to which you always give same answer. (My 
favourite one is 'This will end your Windows session' warning. Of course I 
want to end Windows session! Just why does Program Manager think I just 
double-clicked its top-left corner?). Well, this program can help in this way. 
If it detects some 'stupid question' is on the screen, it just answers it 
(unless you are holding shift key). I believe this will make your Windows a 
little less ugly (or more friendly?). 

                               swMouse V1.10

when writing Windows applications, but also if you want to know how many 
applications can you run without clicking Program Manager| About all the time. 


                               WinExec V1.00  
                               ══════════════╝
WinExec is resident program, which allows you to execute Windows applications 
from DOS command line or from any other application program (like Norton 
Commander). It needs FManServ to be put into StartUp group of Program Manager. 
(FManServ is part of WinExec package.) 

                                WinRun V1.00
