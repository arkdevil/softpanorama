Sites wishing to mirror the Coast to Coast (CCT) collections will be 
mirroring the /coast/msdos, /coast/win3, /coast/win95, /coast/nt, /coast/os2,
/coast/vendors and other directories which may appear under /coast in the 
future, on the home site SimTel.Coast.NET.

All collections must be mirrored as-is, with no changes in content or
the arrangement of the directories and must be accessible FREE OF CHARGE
to Internet users for browsing and downloading.  All files, including the
copyright notices and .message files must be included.  Text files shall
not be compressed.  The .message files must be displayed by your ftp and
www servers to clearly indicate that this is a CCT collection, not
your own.  No other files may be added to these directory trees without
formal approval from Coast to Coast Telecommunications, Inc.

The paths should include the name Coast (or coast if you prefer lower
case), followed by msdos, win3, win95, nt, os2, and vendors; for example:
/pub/Coast/msdos or /pub/coast/msdos.  The reason for the two-level
directory is to clearly identify the source of the collections and to
allow for future additions of additional directories under coast.

Please contact mirrors@Mail.Coast.NET to obtain permission to mirror
these collections.  A mirror site agreement is required.
