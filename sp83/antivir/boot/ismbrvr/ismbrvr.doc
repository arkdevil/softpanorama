            Stormbringer's Instant MBR Virus Remover (c) 1995

USE THIS PROGRAM AT YOUR OWN RISK!  No guarauntees are made as to the
functionality of this program.  By running it, you agree to hold the
author harmless for any damages done.  If you do not accept these
terms, delete all files that came in this set.

This program will read your MBR, tunnel interrupt 13h, then reread
the MBR and check to see if something is stealthing out disk reads.
If so, it assumes that it is a virus, and will rewrite the MBR with
what probably "should" be there.  There is a slight risk to this,
so don't use it unless you have a stealth virus that you can't cure.

To use - boot from your hard drive - THE VIRUS MUST BE IN MEMORY FOR THIS
TO WORK!  Preferably, bypass your autoexec and config (F5 in Dos 6+).
Then, run ISMBRVR.  Afterwards, press the reset button or power off the
machine.  It will store any virus found in VIRUS.MBR.  Do NOT use 
CTRL-ALT-DEL.

I do not recommend the use of this program on non-DOS systems.  Use at
your own risk.

If you have any questions/comments, email me at sbringer@netcom.com.

Also - it will not work against stealth routines such as those STRANGE
is rumored to have.  This will be fixed soon.


Cheers,
Stormbringer, Phalcon/SKISM
