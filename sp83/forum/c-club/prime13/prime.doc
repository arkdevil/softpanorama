                   --==| PRIME NUMBER GENERATOR v1.3 |==--

[What's New]
============

Prime v1.3 has a few minor upgrades such as improved executables and a few
small changes to the output.

MACPRIME is no longer part of this distribution. The person who ported it for
me is unreachable and couldn't take care of the recent upgrades. If you would
like to contribute with a PowerPC native version of Prime, please contact me.
All pre-compiled executables, except PRIME_SX, are optimized for 486DX.

[PRIMEDOS.EXE, PRIME_SX.EXE] 
============================

MS-DOS version of PRIME. Uses 32bit DOS extender CWSDPMI to use all of the
available memory. PRIME_SX is for included for people using 486/386 SX's.
Compiler: djgpp (beta3)


[PRIMEOS2.EXE]
==============

OS/2 Warp version of PRIME. Runs in a full-screen session only for maximum
speed. Compiler: EMX GCC v0.9b
In order to run PRIMEOS2.EXE, you need the EMX Runtime version v0.9b. Ftp to:

[PRIMELIN]
==========

Linux version of PRIME. Tested only under Linux Slackware 1.2.13. This is by
far the fastest (and smallest) executable included here, compared to DOS and 
OS/2 on the same machine. Compiler: GCC v2.7.0


[HISTORY]
=========

prime.zip
        First release, contained only one DOS executable for DX's.

prime10.zip
        Contained new DOS executable for SX's as well as an OS/2 port.

prime10a.zip
        New: Macintosh port (runs rather slowly).

prime11.zip
        Improved code, lets user start at any point. OS/2 port significantly
        accelerated, speed increase of about 29%.

prime11a.zip
        Modified OS/2 executable, runs in FULLSCREEN only.

prime12.zip
        Prime v1.2 has been updated to include a Linux executable, which is 
        very fast. The MAXIMUM allowed number that PRIME can display has 
        been raised, from 2,147,483,647 to 1.8 X 10^308, that should be 
        enough for most people.

prime13.zip

[REDIRECTING OUTPUT]
====================

You can redirect PRIME's output from the screen to a file by using the
following syntax:

prime > outputfile

You will have to enter the start number, and then hit enter. Everything will
be written to the file, so your screen will be blank. PRIME runs *much* 
faster if its output is redirected to a file.
