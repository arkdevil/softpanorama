This is the README for NGDUMP, a decompiler for Norton Guides Database
files. NGDUMP is based on NG_CLONE, a clone of the NG program I found
on SIMTEL (<msdos.txtutl>ng_clone.zip). I modified the program to emit
source code for the NG compiler.

usage:		ngdump databasefile[.ng]

NGDUMP creates numbered data-files (1.dat, 2.dat, etc.) with the text,
a NG linker control file (GUIDE.LCF), and a makefile (MAKEGUID).
