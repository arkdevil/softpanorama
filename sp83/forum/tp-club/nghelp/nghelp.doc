Using NGHELP (Norton Guide Help) is very simple.
At the dos prompt type: NGHELP
(see history below for command options)
Now it will remain in memory until you choice to UnInstall it.
To activate NGHELP press LeftShift+F1. If a file named 'NGHELP.INI' is in the 
directory where NGCL.EXE resides (only for Dos 3.0 and higher otherwhise NGHELP
searches the PATH for this file) , then NGHELP popups with the NG file when you 
last saved NGHELP.INI.

When no NG file is active you can go to the menu wich is called Options. 
Press return when the Database is highlighted. NGHELP looks in the current 
directory if NGHELP.INI is not available otherwhise in the directory which is 
saved in NGHELP.INI for the NG files. When NG files are available it popups
with a menu. Press return, NGHELP will now load the information containing 
the choisen NG file.

Keys who are used :

About the source code:
The source for the norton guide clone is complete except for the following
units:
YNSYSTEM
YNCRT
YNDOS
STRINT
SWAPOPUP
SWAPVARS

I can't release these units because of some copyright resonse.
SWAPOPUP and SWAPVARS are units which implement the TSR swapping part. It's
completly written by me a few years back. The TPU version can only write the
HEAP to XMS,EMS or file.
NGHELP.EXE is linked with the complete version and leaves only a 4 kb part
in memory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
History
3.01  Small bug in initalisation code for color detecting fixed.
3.00  Rewrote almost everything. SWAPOPUP now also suports XMS and EMS.
      Renamed NGCL to NGHELP. Color support in the NG files is now fully 
      supported.
2.00ß Error in TSR code. Forgot to save AX and BX resulting in some
      stranges errors.
2.00α First version where file swapping was implemented (Used self 
      written Swappable TSR code)
      there are 3 swapping methods
      /1  allmost everything will be swapped out to disk.(about 5k remains TSR)
      /2  only the HEAP will be swapped to disk (50000 bytes approximely)
      /3  Don't swap to disk keep everything in memory
      /d  directory where swapfiles will be saved
1.20
Made 'database in Option menu' automatic.
Put code in to support the following previously not working functions
 -Full Screen
 -Auto lookup
 -Save options (writes file 'NGCL.INI')
When NGCL is started it reads a file called 'NGCL.INI' (if available). 
NGCL is sometimes faster when reading a NG file.
1.05 (Not made public)
Renamed NGC to NGCL. (found out NGC is the name of compiler to make NG files)
NGCL now uses less memory than before.
Fixed some bugs discovered using CXL51.NG. 
1.02 
Fixed another bug. Should now work on a Monochroom screen also.
1.01
Changed Color for Monochroom screens and fixed a small bug
1.00
I first wrote this program ussing NG.TPU (by Pepijn Smiths) when I had NGC
almost ready I found out that NG.TPU had a number of bugs, because of this
I wrote this interface myself. If somebody is interrested in the source 
(Only NG interface!) contact me at one of the adresses below(It's written 
in Turbo Pascal 5.5).

if Somebody discovers a bug please send me an e-mail to:
NELEMANS@CT.UTWENTE.NL
