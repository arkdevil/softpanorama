*--------------------------------

    BCR is a program for use in batch files
    to cause multiple CR,LF's; usually for spacing purposes
    on the screen, such as between menus, informative echo lines, etc.

    syntax :
              BCR         ( 1 CR, LF )
              BCR n       ( 1 - 9 CR, LF's )
              BCR nn      ( 1 - 25 CR, LF's )

    if n is < 1 or n > 9 then n is set to 1
    if nn is < 01 or nn > 25 then nn is set to 1
