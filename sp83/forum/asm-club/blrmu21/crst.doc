*  CRST = cursor reset
*-----------------------

    CRST is a program which re-sets
    the starting and ending lines for the cursor,
    in case they get changed drastically by some program.

    It is presently set to :

    start = 6
    end   = 7

    If that is not to your satisfaction,
    then change CRST.ASM and re-assemble it.
