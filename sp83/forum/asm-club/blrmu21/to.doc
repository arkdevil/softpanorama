   this program allows you to change :

   TO a new drive + directory


   syntax :

     to n:
     to n ddd


     where n  = new drv
     where :  = root directory
     where d  = directory name

   examples :


   to d: - this will change to drive 'd' and root directory
   to d ddd - this will change to drive 'd' and directory 'ddd'

          color to white on cyan
