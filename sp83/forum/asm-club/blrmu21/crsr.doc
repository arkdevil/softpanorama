*  CRSR = cursor off/on
*-----------------------------

    this program either turns off the cursor
    ( after saving the first and last line values )
    ( in the space occupied by an empty interrupt address, )
    ( such as user interrupts ( UI ) 60h thru 66h )

    or turns it back on
    ( using the first and last line values previously stored ) -

    this program will check UI 60h thru 66h for you,
    and if it finds one of them empty,
    then it will act on the passed parameter -

    if all of these UI's are being used, then this program will put out a
    message stating such, and terminate -

    crsr syntax :

    crsr       ( default = turn cursor off )
    crsr off   ( turns cursor off )
    crsr on    ( turns cursor on  )
