This text file describes what INI files are and how they are supported  by  this
program and other programs by the same author.  INI files  are  always  optional
but they can be very useful.

An INI file is a way of specifying parameters for a program that you don't  want
to have to respecify from the command  line  each  time.   This  allows  you  to
override the program defaults automatically.

This is very useful if you disagree with the defaults I've established  for  the
routines.  It is also useful in cases where you typically use  the  command  one
way but in fairly regular cases you need to run the command using a whole  bunch
of different parameters.  You can set up one INI file for  your  standard  usage
and then provide a different INI file when it's time  to  run  the  lesser  used
versions.

Each of the programs reads an INI file if it can find one.  By default, the  INI
file that is searched for is based on the executable's name but not always. This
is shown below (block declarations and  environmental  variables  are  described
later):

The INI file is an ASCII text file that can be created maintained by hand.   The
commands in the INI file should begin in column 1.  It can consist of:

  (a) Command-line parameters
  (b) Comments
  (c) Block declarations
  (d) Special items (vary by routine)

(a)  Command-line parameters:  The INI file can consist or one or  more  command
     line parameters.  In  most  cases,  it  can  *only*  include  command  line
     parameters that begin with a slash ("/").  These will vary  by  routine  of
     course but, in READ for example, your INI file might appear like this:

        /MONO
        /-DOS
        /COLOR=123 134 145 156

(b)  Comments: The INI file can also contain comment lines.  These  are  defined
     as any lines that  are  either  blank  or  contain  any  of  the  following
     characters in column 1:

        (space) (any line that is indented is a comment)
        ;       (semi-colon)
        :       (colon)
        '       (quote)

(c)  Block declarations:  You can combine INI files if you'd like.   This  saves
     some disk space.  Typically, this  is  done  in  connection  with  the  SET
     BG=inifile environmental parameter (described below).  Blocks are  declared
     by using the name of searched-for routine  in  brackets.   (See  the  table
     above to  see  what  blocks  are  searched  for  for  each  routine.)   Any
     statements between one block and the next are assumed to be associated with
     the first routine.  For example:

        ; ALL.INI -- contains all of the INI statements
        [DATES]
        /SORT
        [FILL]
        /ON
        /SPLIT
        [READ]
        /MONO

(d)  Special items:  Some routines allow the INI file to include statements that
     cannot be specified from the command line.  These  special  statements  are
     described in the specific routine's documentation.

Where does each program look for the INI file?

Each program here looks for an INI file unless instructed otherwise.  The  logic
used is as follows.  Note that the first "hit" wins:

(a)  No INI file is checked for if any of the following is true:
      - /-I or /INULL is passed in from the command line
      - /-I or /INULL is passed in from the routine's environmental parameter
           (e.g. SET READ=/-I)
      - the environmental variable BG is set to the value of /-I or /INULL
           (e.g. SET BG=/-I)
     Most programs accept either  /-I  or  /INULL.   However,  several  routines
     (BFIND and CHANGE) accept /-I to mean do a  case-insensitive  search.   For
     these programs, you *have* to use /INULL instead.

(b)  If a /Iinitfile setting is passed in, the routine uses  this  to  determine
     the name of the INI file to look for.  Note that the file name must include
     a period (e.g. "/ICHANGE.INI") or the program will skip it.

(c)  The routine looks for an environmental variable BG.  If  this  variable  is
     defined (and it's not set to /-I), then the routine takes this  to  be  the
     name of the INI file to look for.

(d)  The routine looks for the INI file under the "INI file" name shown  in  the
     table at the start of this documentation.

If the INI file name does not include  either  a  drive  or  path  specification
(e.g., you don't pass in something like /IC:\ALL.INI), the routine  will  search
for the named file.  It will check  for  it  in  the  following  places  in  the
following order.  The first place that it finds it wins:

  - Your default subdirectory (where you were when you executed the command)
  - The subdirectory that contains the EXE that you're executing
  - Your regular DOS path

If you do not have an INI file, this searching can take awhile especially if you
have any networked drives in your path.  In this  case,  specifying  "/-I"  will
save some time.  Passing in a fully qualified filename also helps.

Personally, I have a common INI file named WAYNE.INI in the root of my C: drive.
I put it there so I don't run out of environmental space by specifying some huge
path.  I have the following statement in my AUTOEXEC.BAT:

     SET BG=C:\WAYNE.INI

Currently, my C:\WAYNE.INI file looks like this:

     [AV]
     /on
     [bfind]
     /-empty
     [COPSINCE]
     /def text=*.bas *.bi *.c *.diz *.doc *.h *.ref *.sas *.sc *.txt
     /def prg=*.bas *.bat *.bi *.c *.h *.sas
     /to c:\temp
     /replace
     /-beep
     /text
     /copy -0
     [DATES]
     /cc:\mine\datemine.txt
     /sort
     /day
     /-i
     [FILL]
     /letter
     [htmstrip]
     /lc:\vbdos\htmstrip.ini
     /-symbols
     /warnings
     [paginate]
     /overwrite
     /cc:\bat\brucedoc.ctl
     [txtable]
     /debug

If I ever need to override the WAYNE.INI settings, it's easy to  do  by  passing
them in from the command line or by specifying /-I from the command line.
