MOZ.DOC                              1                         Revised: 07-19-96

The MOZ program processes your Netscape Web cache, renaming or copying files  so
their file names correspond to the original names they had  on  the  originating
site.  Features of this program:

  * Renames or copies all of the files in the cache.
  * Should work for the caches from version 2.0 of Netscape.
  * Originally was written to handle Mosaic caches version 2.0 or above although
    I don't use Mosaic anymore so I have no idea if it still works.
  * Renames each file (with file names like M0OSOSFD.GIF) to match their
    original names on the originating site as closely as possible (so this
    file might end up being BATMAN.GIF).
  * If there are files with duplicate source names, it renames according to
    a sequential system (BATMAN01.GIF, BATMAN02.GIF, etc).
  * Reads each of the files in the cache and determines the file type.
    File types can be any of the following:
      AU  (sound files)
      BMP (graphic files)
      EXE (compiled programs)
      GIF (graphic files)
      HTM (HTML files)
      JPG (graphic files)
      MID (sound files)
      WAV (sound files)
      ZIP (compressed files)
    Renames the file extension according to the file type.
  * Files marked read-only, system, or hidden are ignored during renaming.
  * When the /RENAME option is used, a fail-safe file called C:\MOZBACK.BAT
    is, by default, created which contains all of the RENAME commands
    necessary to rename everything back the way it was.


Specifying parameters:

Parameters for this program can be set in the following ways.  The last  setting
encountered always wins:
  - Read from an *.INI file (see BRUCEINI.DOC file),
  - Through the use of an environmental variable (SET MOZ=whatever), or
  - From the command line (see "Syntax" below)

Syntax:

    MOZ [ path | /Cpath ] [ /COPY | /RENAME ] [ /-FINAL ] [ /-MOZBACK ]
      [ /MONO ] [ /DEBUG ] [ /Iinitfile | /-I ] [ /? ]

where:

"path" (or "/Cpath") is where the files are found.  If no path is provided,  the
program defaults to looking in the following locations in sequence:

        default subdirectory
        C:\NETSCAPE\CACHE
        C:\MOSAIC\CACHE
        D:\NETSCAPE\CACHE
        D:\MOSAIC\CACHE

The  first  subdirectory  that  exists  and  contains  any  files  meeting   the
specification *.MO* or M0*.* will be the one processed by the command.

"/COPY" specifies that the processed files are to  be  copied  under  their  new
names, not renamed.  This can lead to very confusing results if you ever run the
command more than once on the same subdirectory without cleaning out the cache.

"/RENAME" specifies that the files are to be renamed instead of copied.  This is
initially the default.

"/FINAL" renames all files in the cache,  whether  they're  in  the  Web-created
directory file (e.g. FAT.DB) or not.  Note that if your Web  browser  GPF'ed  or
something nasty while you were running it, the FAT.DB file will be incomplete or
even missing.  /FINAL allows the orphan files to be processed  somewhat.   Files
matching either *.MO* (Mosaic's default filter)  or  M0*.*  (Netscape's  default
filter)  will  be  renamed  sequentially  starting  with  _000.*  if  /FINAL  is
specified.  This is initially the default.

"/-FINAL" specifies that the program should ignore files  that  remain  in  your
output subdirectory  after  processing  the  Web-created  directory  file  (e.g.
FAT.DB).  "/FINAL" is initially the default.

"/MOZBACK" creates a file called C:\MOZBACK.BAT which contains all of the RENAME
commands required to name everything in the cache back  to  its  original  name.
This file is only created if /RENAME is used.  This is initially the default.

"/-MOZBACK" skips creating the C:\MOZBACK.BAT  file.   The  initial  default  is
"/MOZBACK".

"/MONO" (or "/-COLOR") does  not  try  to  override  screen  colors.   Initially
defaults to "/COLOR".

"/COLOR" (or "/-MONO") allows screen colors to be overridden.  This is initially
the default.

"/DEBUG" tells you what it would  rename  everything  but  doesn't  actually  do
anything.

"/Iinitfile" says to read an initialization file with the file name  "initfile".
The file specification *must* contain a period.  Initfiles are described in  the
BRUCEINI.DOC file.  Initially defaults to "/IMOZ.INI".

"/-I" (or "/INULL") says to skip loading the initialization file.
