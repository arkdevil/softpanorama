        derives  income  from.  This is a blatant commercial announcement and  we 
        have no excuses for it! We have kept it short, though, with the full text 
        available on the RamNet BBS at (212)-889-6438.  Or,  we can send you more 
        information  if you check off the box on the registration form.  On  with 
        the show! 


        What is RamNet?
        ===============

        RamNet is a background, memory resident program which enables you to:

         *  Run your own Bulletin Board System -- in the background!
         *  Have  Electronic Mail (E-Mail) across the nation or across the  globe 
            today....with no hardware other than your PC and modem!
         *  Do  file  transfers  (both  upload  and  download)  totally  in   the  
            background,  so you can continue your normal processing  tasks in the 
            foreground.
         *  Run  SCRIPT files that allow you to upload and download to any  other 
            computer system.
         *  Utilize  RamNet  as a "normal" communications package  via  a   user-
            selectable  Hot-Key.  Start  transfers in the foreground and   switch 
            them  to  the  background -- only a  keystroke  away!  The   transfer 
            continues while you work on something else.
         *  Incoming E-Mail may be immediately printed if you desire.   You'll be 
            notified, in any case, when mail has arrived.
         *  RamNet uses the XMODEM protocol for error free file   transfer.  Both 
            Checksum  (with  about 99% error detection) and  CRC (with  at  least 
            99.9% error detection) have been  implemented.
         *  UUCP,  the  protocol  of choice between UNIX sites is now   available 
            between RamNet sites as well. Your RamNet site  will appear as a UUCP 
            allowing file transfers to take place  between UNIX systems and  your 
            PC in "native" mode.  You can  send and receive UNIX mail to and from 
            your PC -- in the  between UNIX systems and your PC in "native" mode. 
            You  can   send and receive UNIX mail to and from your PC  -- in  the  
            background! A free update to handle UNIX News is in the works, too!
         *  Now  your PC can act as a Telex machine,  too!  Your incoming   telex 
            messages  are  stored and/or printed without requiring an   expensive 
            dedicated machine.
         *  Use RamNet as a Source Librarian!  You can specify a given   download 
            directory  as a "locked directory".  Files which are  downloaded  are 
            "locked" from future downloads until  released. 
         *  Wildcard  Transfers via a special Batch file allow you to   customize 
            which files you wish to transfer in one shot.
         *  The following Baudrates are supported:  110,  300,  600, 1200,  2400, 
            4800, 9600, 19200, 38400.
         *  Easily works with any modem, intelligent switch, or direct,  hardwire 
            connection.

        With  RamNet you won't have to schedule your time with the person at  the 
        other  end:  if they're running RamNet,  they'll just continue with their 
        work as you continue with yours.

        RamNet retails for only $149,  and we offer a full money back  guarantee.
