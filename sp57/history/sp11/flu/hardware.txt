        damage a determined worm attempts.  It does as much as I can think
        of, but that may not be sufficient for the sites which really can not
        afford to have their data damaged.

        We're in the process of designing and producing a hardware board which
        will interface with a future release of FLU_SHOT+.  This will be a
        commercial product.  We don't expect it to cost an arm and a leg, but
        we haven't got the costs nailed down as of yet.  When we do, we'll
        announce the product, its limitations and advantages and, of course,
        its price.

        If you'd like more information on our future hardware board, please
        check off the appropriate box on the registration form and we'll keep
        you advised.
