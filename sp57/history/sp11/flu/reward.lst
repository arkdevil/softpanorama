        All of these product names are probably trademarked by the company, and
        are listed in no particular order.

        Additionally, the companies' themselves know nothing of these donations:
        they have been made by users of these products.  Some of the products
        are used, but are complete with disks and original manuals

        If the company has a problem with donating the software or hardware
        mentioned above, it will be stricken from the list.

        If you'd like to add to this list, and I'm hoping you do, please fill
        out the REWARD.FRM form and foreward it to me ASAP.  DO NOT SEND YOUR
        DONATION YET!  We'll advise you when (not if!) we get the worm(s).

        This list will be updated from time to time and passed around the BBS
        circuit.

        Contribute all that good hardware and software you no longer need!
