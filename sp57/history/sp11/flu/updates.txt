        1.   There was an error in the Boot Checksum routine which would
             occasionally cause a false trigger.  Fixed.
        2.   Some of the new calls under DOS 4.x were not covered by V1.6
             of FLU_SHOT+.  They are now.
        3.   Certain TSR's would cause a false triggering of Direct Disk
             Write attempts.  This false triggering has been fixed.
        4.   The options list you would normally type on the command line
             can now be inserted into the FLUSHOT.DAT file with a "O=",
             as in "O=-F -W", etc.
        5.   Registered  FLU_SHOT+ users now get a spiffy installation
             program to make their usage of FLU_SHOT+ a bit easier.  This
             installation program may not be distributed with unregistered
             copies of the program.
        6.   The rights to FLU_SHOT++, the big brother of FLU_SHOT+ and a
             full data security product (in addition to being an anti-virus
             program), have been purchased by a software publisher of some
             repute.  They purchased the exclusive rights to the product,
             so I'm not allowed to sell it myself! The world of software
             distribution can be more interesting than any science fiction!

             On the order form, part of the archive, you'll find information
             on how to order FLU_SHOT++. If you're a corporate user of
             FLU_SHOT+, I think you'll find the new product has been tailored
             to meet your needs very precisely, and I encourage you to try a
             copy.  FLU_SHOT++ is not available on bulletin board systems and
             is not a shareware product: therefore it may not be freely distributed.
