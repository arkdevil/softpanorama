         | TERSE Version 1.4 |
         \-------------------/

          Tiny ``BRIEF''-like editor by
          Joseph (Yossi) Gil.


TERSE is a tiny (only 4096 bytes) but amazingly powerful full-screen
editor for files of up to 64K in length. TERSE runs on all PC compatible
machines. Its command keys are very similar to those of the famous BRIEF
editor (by UnderWare Inc.). TERSE can edit both UNIX and MS-DOS style text
files as well as binary files. No hacker's disk is complete without it.
No disk, be it hard or floppy, is too full to include it.

TERSE is free (but copyrighted) to private users. However, if you use
TERSE for any commercial application, i.e., in your company, at work,
etc., or make money from selling software or distributing shareware,
you are *required* to register your copy of TERSE. Registration cost is
only $15 and will buy you a personalized version, configuration utilities
and grant your institution a site license. For an additional payment of
only $5, you will get the source code of TERSE.


Highlights
==========
 o  Very small: fits in 4096 bytes = 4 clusters on 5.25"/3.5" floppies.
 o  Minimal free memory requirements: 137KB.
 o  Use current screen size, including the most common 80x25 screen
    dimensions but also unusual sizes such as 40x16, 40x25, 40x40,
    40x50, 132x25, 132x43, 96x33, 80x30, 80x33, etc.
 o  Fully DESQview (version 2.0 and above) aware.
 o  Edit binary files. TERSE is ideal for a quick and dirty job
    of editing and patching strings in small programs.
  o  Supports editing of UNIX style files (lines terminated with '\n').
 o  Supports both '/' and '\' as directory separator.
 o  Edit lines of unlimited length (limited only by file size).
 o  Automatic unlimited horizontal scrolling.
 o  Status line indicating: current column, current line, horizontal
    scrolling, total number of lines, file name, modified status and
    insert/overwrite status.
 o  BRIEF-like keyboard configuration.
 o  Support for TABS, and configurable tab positions.
 o  Prevents snow when run on a CGA screen.
 o  CUT, COPY and PASTE
 o  SEARCH, SEARCH again, and TRANSLATE commands.
 o  Safe: will confirm exits when text is not saved.
 o  Edit files whose name contains spaces and other weird names.

Requirements
=============
 o  PC-DOS/MS-DOS version 2.0 or higher
 o  137KB free memory
 o  64KB free disk space


New in version 1.4
==================
1) The source code of TERSE is now made available to the public for a
   very modest registration fee of $20: $15 for the basic registration,
   and an additional $5 for the source code.

2) The pre-release of SLIM was greatly enhanced. SLIM can do every
   thing TERSE can, and has the following additional features:

   o  "read file into buffer" command <Alt-R>
   o  "switch to another file" command <Alt-E>, 
   o  "go to line number" command <Alt-G>, 
   o  "set right margin" command <Alt-M>,
   o  "swap cursor and mark" command <Shift-Tab>, 
   o  "pump block thru external filter" command <Alt-F>, 
   o  "exchange marked block with paste buffer"  command <Keypad *>, and 
   o   display of the hexadecimal value of the current char in the 
       status line. 

   The current char display uses a special notation for the TAB, EOF
   and CR characters as well as for the CRLF combination.

3) Whenever TERSE prompts you for an input it will also offer your
   previous input to the same prompt as a default response string.  For
   example, upon pressing <Alt-S>, TERSE will display the prompt "Search
   for: " in the status line, and will offer your previous response
   to the prompt "Search for: ". You can use this previous response
   unchanged (hit <ENTER>) or you can delete characters from it (use the
   <Backspace> key) or you can add characters to it (hit any arrow key,
   and start adding characters. If you immediately start typing a new
   entry, the default string is deleted and replaced by what you type.
   Hitting the <Ctrl-U> key will delete all the currently entered 
   response. The configuration utilities allow changing <Ctrl-U> to any
   other control letter. (13 bytes squeezed in.)

 4) Several external filters are now included in the unabridged
   distribution. These utilities are intended to be used in conjunction
   with the "pump block thru external filter" command. These filters
   include among others: 'cat', 'wc', 'lf', 'crlf', 'quote' and
   'nfmt'. With the exception of 'nfmt', the registration of TERSE
   includes registration of all of these programs. Ross Paterson,
   <rap@doc.ic.ac.uk> the author of NFMT, recently posted the sources
   in the alt.sources usenet newsgroup. Porting to the PC and some
   packaging were done by myself later.

5) Several useful utilities are now included with in unabridged
   distribution. These utilities include among others the following
   programs: 'esc', 'lptstat', 'bigc', 'litc'. The registration of TERSE
   includes registration of all of these utilities.

6) A pre-release of TERSE for the HP 95lx palmtop (named h.com) is
   now included in the unabridged distribution. This program, together
   with the option in the configuration utilities to set the file size
   replaces WEE. The key binding of H.COM is slightly different than
   that of TERSE and SLIM, to support the keyboard of the HP 95lx.

7) The font loader and the fonts used for editing binary files are
   now included in the unabridged distribution.

8) The configuration utilities have been enhanced. Among other
   things, more control of the status line attributes was added and
   more options of automatic horizontal scroll. Thanks to Mike Bessy
   (from JP Soft- ware) <75300.1215@compuserve.com> and to Terry Chan
   <echan@chinug.acns.nwu.edu> for suggesting some of these changes.

9) The distribution of TERSE now includes a batch file to assist
   in invoking the editor on several files. An .BTM file for setting
   appropriate aliases in 4DOS is included as well.

10) Many of the documentation and configuration utilities
   typos have been corrected. Special thanks to Joan Abarbanel
   <abraban@taunivm.tau.ac.il> for her careful proofreading of a previous
   version of this file. Terry Chan <echan@chinug.acns.nwu.edu> did a
   great job of pointing out to me errors and typos in the configuration
   utilities as well as in the documentation. [Note that I still take
   the credit and blame for all remaining errors which have not yet been
   found and corrected.]

11) The following scenario used to create a file of length 0:

    T newfile
    <Alt-Q>

   This bug has been fixed. Thanks to the many kind users who brought
   this bug to my attention. (4 bytes of code added.)

12) TERSE recognizes and parses correctly file names which include
   dots in them (e.g., ..\..\file.dat). Previously, such files would
   not be saved. (20 bytes code squeezed in.)

13) TERSE can now read files of size 65,535 exactly. Previously,
   files of this size could be created by TERSE, but not read by it.
   (4 bytes code squeezed in.)

14) Eliminated several bugs related to the display of the help screen,
   including the mis-alignment when ANSI console driver was present,
   eliminated. (12 bytes gained.)

15) Eliminated a bug which could have caused TERSE to hang after
   pushing to DOS version 2.x. (4 bytes code squeezed in.)

16) Terse now beeps whenever a save file attempt fails. Previously, the
   only indication of such an error was that the "Write successful"
   message didn't appear. (2 bytes code squeezed in.)

17) Next/Previous line now recognize all of the following characters
   as word separators: space, tab, vertical tab, carriage return, line
   feed, and form feed.

New in version 1.3
==================
1) Simplified and unified the configuration utilities.

2) Added a pre-release of LEAN, WEE and SLIM.

3) Included some of the configuration utilities in the shareware
   distribution. The font loaders required for binary file editing
   are still part of the registration package.

4) Fixed a bug, introduced in version 1.2, that prevented the display
   of the status line.

New in Version 1.2
==================
1) Code size was shrunk by another 9 (!) bytes.

2) The restriction on distribution by fee shareware distributors has
   been removed.

3) After a successful print (Alt-P), the marked block is unmarked.

4) Pre-Release versions of SLIM, LEAN, WEE and TERSE for HP 95 LX
   palmtop computer are available upon request.

New in Version 1.1
==================
1) A bug in the snow prevention routine which caused TERSE to hang
   on some CGA systems has been corrected. TERSE should run now with
   no problems on all adapters. Many thanks to Andrea Omodeo (E-mail
   address: <ele9037@cdc835.cdc.polimi.it>) for identifying the bug
   and for suggesting the correction.

2) After considerable work, the 27 bytes code fragment required for
   DESQview awareness was squeezed in. TERSE can now run in a DESQview
   window, and it is fully DESQview aware.

Disclaimer 
==========
This program is written in highly optimized assembly language. The code
is probably the worst spaghetti you have ever seen! This means that the
risk of TERSE having bugs is especially high. The author exterminated
all the bugs he identified, and he did his very best to test the program
thoroughly. However, there might still be other unidentified bugs lurking
there. These bugs by nature are unpredictable. Usage of the program
acknowledges the following disclaimer of warranty: "This program is
supplied as is!" All warranties, expressed or implied, including, without
limitation, the fitness of this program for any purpose, are disclaimed.


Problems, Questions, Suggestions?
=================================
Please do not hesitate to communicate all your thoughts and comments.
I answer all my E-mail usually in less than 24 hours. If you do not get
a response within a reasonable time, it is probably because I didn't
get your message, or because I wasn't able to reply. Kindly try sending
again using another route, and include more alternate return paths.

Compatibility
=============
TERSE uses only pure 8088 instructions and assumes the bare minimum
of the underlying operating system. It should run on your good
old original 4Mhz IBM-PC running under DOS 2.0 as well as on a fast
80486 50Mhz machines running DR DOS 6.0 + 4DOS 4.0, or OS/2 in DOS
compatibility mode. More than once during the development, I had a
chance to save a few bytes by using a more advanced instruction, or
by assuming a more advanced operating system version. I managed to
resist this temptation. Other than that every dirty assembly trick I
could think of was used. It is conceivable that some of the tricks
will prevent TERSE from running on some DOS-like environments and
simulators, although I don't know of any concrete example.

UNIX style files
================
TERSE will edit UNIX style files directly. That is, TERSE uses
both '\n' (aka LF, aka Line-Feed) and a '\r\n' (aka CRLF, aka
Carriage-return + Line-feed) combo for line ends. Hitting ENTER will
enter '\r\n', but Ctrl-ENTER will enter '\n'. (Configuration utilities
allow swapping these 2 keys.) Thus, you can transfer UNIX text files
to your PC, edit them on the PC, and then transfer them back without
need for file conversion.

Binary files editing
====================
TERSE can edit binary files as well. It is somewhat limited in the sense
that it does not display the hexadecimal value of each char, so you
need to keep an ASCII table handy. (The status line of SLIM displays
the hexadecimal value of the current char.) In addition the following
characters: space (ASCII 32), Null (ASCII 0), and Meta-Del (ASCII 255)
all look the same.  The configuration utilities give a simple solution
to this problem on EGA/VGA compatible systems by allowing you to use a
modified screen font.

Configuration Utilities
=======================
If you are a private user who uses TERSE "for pleasure", you are not
required to register. If you use TERSE as part of your work, or make
money from its distribution, you are required to register. The small
registration fee ($15) will buy you a site license. Yes, this is
correct, the whole site such as a university with all its PCs, need
only register once.

The configuration utilities will allow you to: swap the Enter and
Ctrl-Enter keys, change the tab size to 2/4/8/16 (I personally prefer
tabs set every 4 characters), and modify the key assignments (with
some minor restrictions). In addition, you can eliminate the snow
check done automatically on CGA screens, and will get better support
(as described above) for editing binary files on EGA/VGA screens.


Future
======
The main constraint in adding features to TERSE is that its total
size must be exactly 4096 bytes. All additions are dependent on my
ability to squeeze the current code further. I usually work several
hours, and sometimes days, for each byte squeezed. And this task is
getting harder and harder all the time. (A few versions had a slack
of very few bytes. In these versions, a few dummy bytes were appended
to the program to keep its size 4096 bytes exactly.)

I have several other possible directions for the development of TERSE.
These directions are: ``the TERSE family'' and ``the TERSE library''.
I am looking forward to hearing from _you_, the user, about what you
think of these ideas.

The TERSE library is an object code library which could be invoked
from a C program. The members of the TERSE family will be:

    LEAN    A  3K  file  viewer.  This is basically  TERSE  without  the
            editing  code.  Naturally, LEAN could never compete with the
            excellent  LIST  utility of Vernon D. Buerg,  and many other
            fine tiny file-listers.

    SLIM    An extended  TERSE version (at the 5K level) with some extra
            features.  Some  features for which I have received requests
            are:

            o  Read file into buffer.
            o  Move to editing another file.
            o  Go to line.
            o  Word wrap, margin setting and word-wrap on/off.
            o  Backward search.
            o  Edit next file in command line.

Files
=====
TERSE is distributed in two forms: the full distribution and an
abridged version. The full distribution consists of the following
files: (files marked with * are missing in the abridged version.)

T.COM           The actual  TERSE  editor program.  No  other  files are
                necessary for proper operation of TERSE.

TERSE.DOC       This  file.  The  documentation for the program. It  may
                be printed by:

PRINTDOC.BAT    A  batch  file  for printing the documentation of TERSE.
                This file will also  print  MID-EAST.MBX  if you created
                it.

_DESC.BTM       A  4dos  batch  file for creating file name  description
                for the above files.

MID-EAST.R13*  (rotate 13 encrypted file).


MID-EAST.MBX*   Some facts and tips about the  Middle East  (uncrypted).
                This  file  is _not_ part  of  the  distribution, but it
                can be created by

UNROT13.BAT     Batch file to (i) create MID-EAST.MBX from  MID-EAST.R13
                using the  ROT13 filter,  and (ii) display MID-EAST.MBXP
                using T.COM.

PRTIP.BAT       Batch file to send MID-EAST.MBX to the printer

L.COM*          A pre-release of the LEAN file lister.

S.COM*          A pre-release of the SLIM editor, an extended version of
                TERSE.

H.COM*          A pre-release of  SLIM built especially for the  HP 95lx
                palmtop  computer.   You  can   use  the   configuration
                utilities to limit the file size to  32KB, thus reducing
                the memory requirements. The help screen is minimized to
                16x40 chars.  The program has special code for detecting
                the  HP9LX,  and  if  one is detected, only the top left
                16x40 part of the virtual screen is used.

TCONFIG.COM*    Configuration program for T.COM.

SCONFIG.COM*    Configuration program for S.COM.

LCONFIG.COM*    Configuration program for L.COM.

HCONFIG.COM*    Configuration program for H.COM.

TKEYS.COM*      Keyboard configuration program for T.COM.

SKEYS.COM*      Keyboard configuration program for S.COM.

SKEYS.COM*      Keyboard configuration program for H.COM.

MXIFY.COM*      A pre-release of a program which gives TERSE and its
                partners an EMACS style. Usage is:

                    MXIFY T filename

BIGC.COM*       A program to set a big cursor (Useful on PALMTOPS.)

LITC.COM*       A program to set a little cursor (Useful on PALMTOPS.)

ESC.COM*        A program to send  ESCAPE characters.  Examples of usage
                are:

                 ESC [7m
                 ESC 0 > prn

ROT13.COM*      A ``rotate 13'' filter.

LF.COM*         Filter. DOS to UNIX text file translation program.

CRLF.COM*       Filter. UNIX to DOS text file translation program.

CAT.COM*        Filter. Concatenate files. Like UNIX cat

WC.COM*         Filter. Count lines, words, chars. Like UNIX wc

TT.BAT*         Call terse on multiple files/wildecards

TTALIAS.BTM*    Demo: make 4DOS aliases for terse

NFMT.ZIP*       UNIX fmt-like formatter. NFMT is a simple text 
                formatter, which is very similar to the BSD program
                fmt(1).  However NFMT uses a best-fit line breaking
                algorithm, by a simple version of "Breaking Paragraphs
                into Lines", Donald E. Knuth and Michael F. Plass,
                "Software--Practice and Experience" 11 (1981)
                1119-1184. Author: Ross Paterson <rap@doc.ic.ac.uk>,
                porting to Turbo-C by Yossi Gil <yogi@cs.ubc.ca>.
                This archive includes the following files:

How to get
==========
TERSE is available from Simtel, Garbo, wustl, their mirrors and from
other fine ftp archive sites. Some of these sites have mail-server
for those who cannot ftp. Some of these sites carry only the abridged
distribution.

In addition, the latest version of TERSE is regularly deposited in
    cs.ubc.ca:/pub/pickup/trsXXX[af].zip
    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/pub/MSDOS_UPLOADS/trsXXX[af].zip

If you cannot obtain the latest distribution from any of these
sources, feel free to write to me and ask for a uuencoded copy of
the non- abridged distribution (~100K) to be e-mailed to you.

License (copying policy)
========================
The following policy is intended to promote free private use and
distribution, and to collect money from those who can afford to pay
for this software. In particular, those institutions which make money
from private users are requested to pass on part of their income to
whoever is responsible for generating it.

PRIVATE USERS. You are free to use, copy and distribute TERSE for
noncommercial private use provided that:

   A) No fee is charged for use, copying or distribution.

   B) It is not modified in any way.

   C) It is distributed as a package.  All files in this package must be
   included, none should be added, and none should be changed.

Thus if you are a private user, you can *use* TERSE freely, and you
are under no obligation to register. (The only restriction is on its
further distribution.)

Registration (Private users)
============================
If you find TERSE a useful, easy, and nifty editor you may show your
appreciation in one of two ways:

   A) Send the author the $15 US dollars registration fee.

      All registered users will receive the most recent version of
      TERSE, the configuration utilities and, if you wish, a per-
      sonalized version, and the author will do his best to update
      them as soon as a new version comes out.

      Please, do register if you can afford it, and if you would
      like to support financially the production of this high quality
      software.

   B) Decrypt, print and read the enclosed MID-EAST.R13 file, and
      learn some facts about the Middle East and about its role, its
      problems, etc.

      IMPORTANT: The file is given in ``ROT13 form''. This means that
      although it contains only pure printable ASCII characters, it
      has to be decrypted before you can read it. A ROT13 filter is
      supplied with TERSE so that you can decrypt it. The easiest way
      to decrypt, and then print this file is to:

      1) Run the enclosed UNROT13.BAT batch file. Doing so will produce
      MID-EAST.MBX, a clean version of MID-EAST.R13, and then display
      MID-EAST.MBX with LEAN.

      2) To print MID-EAST.MBX, run the enclosed PRTIP.BAT batch file.
      Also, if MID-EAST.MBX exists when you run the PRINTDOC.BAT
      batch file, it will be printed as well.

      This somewhat complicated form of distribution is partly so
      that you will feel that you have applied some conscious effort
      to read it. Another reason is that those who do not wish to
      read this file can easily refrain from doing so.

      MID-EAST.R13 is an integral part of the TERSE distribution,
      but it is not required for the normal operation of TERSE.
      It is supplied so that you can show your support for the quality
      and the concept of TERSE, if you cannot afford to register, by
      reading it.

      Side comment: Being outside of home for some time, I have
      learned that many things about the Middle-East are reflected
      in a very distorted manner in the media. The file MID-EAST.MBX
      is part of a large file which I am compiling which consists of
      verifiable facts gathered from various resources about Israel
      and the Middle East (political views are filtered out).

      MID-EAST.MBX is expected to give you, the reader, a more
      informed perspective on events in the Middle East and on the
      author's country.

      This version of MID-EAST.MBX has facts and papers about the
      the Hizbullah.

=========
TERSE is an exercise of editor writing inspired by TED, the famous
Tiny EDitor (written by Tom Kihlken and published November 1988 in PC
Magazine, Copyright 1988 Ziff Communications Co.). Some features of
TERSE are borrowed from the fine descendants of TED called TEDPLUS
(apparently also written by Tom Kihlken in November 1988) and TED2
(written by James E. Galbraith, 1201 Chase St., Novato CA, 94945, USA).

There is not a single piece of code in TERSE which is the same as in
TED, TEDPLUS or TED2. TERSE represents almost three years of work on
space optimization of the code, and on added functionality. Some of
the newly added features include help screen, unlimited line length,
status line, smooth horizontal scrolling, previous and next word,
UNIX files editing, search and replace, safety features and support
for insertion of all 256 characters of the IBM-PC extended ASCII set
(including <Nul>, <BS>, <CR>, and <LF>). Some old features include
scrolling, cut, copy, paste, and printing operations.

Some of the documentation for TERSE is based on the documentation
provided with TED2. See the article "The tiniest editor you'll ever
need" by Tom Kihlken, in the November 15, 1988 issue of PC Magazine
for further details concerning TED. Also, TED, TEDPLUS and TED2 are
available from SIMTEL20:

    TEDPLUS     PD1:<MSDOS.EDITOR>TEDPLUS.ARC

TERSE is not related in any way to TED3.

DESCRIPTION
===========
Synopsis
                               t [filename]

To invoke  TERSE, just type  "T" from the  DOS command line,  optionally
followed by a filename.

File
----
TERSE will open and read a file whose name (and path, if required) is
initially supplied on the command line. If no file name is provided,
TERSE will open a new file. A name may be supplied later during the
editing session using the ``Output'' command invoked by <Alt-O>.
TERSE expects a legal DOS filename, which may include a path name.
TERSE can also edit files whose names contain spaces. These names
are legal, although most DOS commands cannot manipulate them.

Upon save, the original of the modified file is saved with the
extension .BAK. TERSE will prompt before exit without save. If the
file has the Read-Only attribute set, TERSE will open the file to
allow browsing, but will not allow any edit changes. There is no
"load" or "save" file function from within TERSE.

Basic Editing
-------------
In TERSE, the cursor movement keys (Left, Right, Up, Down, PgUp,
PgDn, etc.) allow you to move around in the text. Text is entered
in insert mode by default. Text can be deleted using the <Del> and
<BackSpace> keys.

Help screen is available upon pressing <F1> or <Alt-H>. When the help
screen is displayed, pressing any key will return you to the text.

Pressing the <Alt-I> key will toggle between Insert and Overstrike
mode.  The Insert/Overwrite state is displayed by an 'Ins' or 'Ovr'
in the status line.

The <Alt-U> key restores up to 255 characters deleted by the <Del>
key or overwritten while in the Overwrite mode. The <Alt-U> key will
only restore the last character deleted with the <Backspace> key.

TERSE text buffer is limited to 65535 characters. An attempt to extend
the buffer beyond that will result in a short beep.

Lines
-----
Lines may be of any length. TERSE recognizes both the UNIX and DOS
conventions for line termination, i.e., both the <CR><LF> pair and a
single <CR> denote end of line. Off screen characters may be viewed by
moving the cursor toward them. Lines may be broken by pressing <Enter>
(insert <CR><LF> pair) or <Ctrl Enter> (insert <CR> character) at
any point, in either Insert or Overstrike mode. Lines may be joined
by pressing <Del> at the line end or <Backspace> at the beginning.
Pressing <Alt-D> deletes the entire line and closes the gap. Pressing
<Alt-K> deletes from the cursor position to the end of the present
line.  Pressing <YANK-LINE> restores the most recent line deletion.
The line delete buffer remains intact until another line is deleted.
The line delete buffer has room for 255 characters.

Block
-----
A Block is some portion of the text file which has been specifically
delineated for later manipulation. One end of a "block" of text is
defined by hitting <Alt-A> key (anchor drop/raise). The other end of
the block is where the cursor is located. Move the cursor with the
cursor control keys to the block end. As you move the cursor, note
that the blocked area is shown in reverse video. The <Alt-A> is a
toggle key, so hitting it again will raise the anchor dropped at the
block end, and thus cancel the blocking operation..

Pressing the <Grey-> key (keypad grey minus key) removes the block to a
paste buffer; this operation is known as ``Cut''. The <Grey+> key copies
the block to the paste buffer without removing it from the text; this
operation is known as ``Copy''. The ``Paste'' operation copies the text
stored at any point where the cursor is located; it is invoked by hitting
the <Ins> key. The paste buffer remains intact until another section is
marked and cut or copied. The paste buffer has room for 64K bytes.

When a block is marked, pressing <Alt-P> prints the marked text
(directly from the file buffer). After the print, the block will
remain marked.

Search and Replace
------------------
TERSE has a string ``Search'' and ``Next'' functions. When the <Alt-S>
key is pressed, the prompt "Search for: " appears on the bottom line.
Enter the desired text string and press the <ENTER> key. If the
string is found, it appears blinking in inverse video on the screen.
The blinking inverse video is extinguished when any key is pressed.
If the string is not found in the area following the cursor, a short
beep will sound. To search for the next occurrence of the string,
press <Alt-N>.  TERSE cannot search backward, and it doesn't recognize
regular expressions.

TERSE also has a ``Translate'' function which is invoked by pressing
the <Alt-T> key. You will be prompted for the string to search for,
and then for the replacement string. The ``translate'' function is
best explained by an example. To change all occurrences of the acronym
PLO in your file to the two-word phrase ``Terrorist Organization'',
you would move to the beginning of the file (Press <Ctrl-PgUp>) and
then press <Alt-T>. TERSE will erase the status line (the last screen
line) and display in its place a prompt:

            Search for: _

(The underscore in the above indicates the cursor position). Type in
the word PLO. The <BackSpace> key can be used for erasing the previous
character. The last line should now read:

            Search for: PLO_

Hit <Enter>. (Hitting <ESC> at this stage will end the translate
operation.) TERSE will now prompt you for the replacement string in
the last screen line:

            Replace with: _

Type in the phrase ``Terrorist Organization''. The last screen line
now reads:

            Replace with: Terrorist Organization_

Hit <Enter>. (Again, hitting <ESC> at this stage will end the
translate operation.) TERSE will search for the first occurrence of
"PLO" in your file, move the cursor to this point, display "PLO" in
blinking inverse video, and then prompt you in the last screen line:

            Replace with: Terrorist Organization [Yes/No/All]?

Your response could be to hit 'Y' or 'y', which means Yes, make
this replacement, or 'N' or 'n' which means No, do not make this
replacement. In both cases, TERSE will continue by moving to the next
occurrence of the string ``PLO'' and prompt you again. You may also
answer the prompt by hitting <Esc>, which will abort the translate
operation. If you wish to replace unconditionally all occurrences of
the string ``PLO'' with ``Terrorist Organization'' (be warned that
it may take a considerable time for a long file), respond with 'A' or
'a'. TERSE will march up the file and make these replacements for you.

Search and Search and Replace are by default case insensitive.
This means that the search will catch all of the following strings:
plo, PLO, pLo, etc. Pressing <Alt C> will change both Search and
Search and Replace to be case sensitive. Pressing <Alt C> again
will return you to the case insensitive Search/Search and Replace.
Note that a short message appears in the status line whenever case
sensitivity is toggled.  This message will be erased, and the normal
status line will reappear, when you go on with your work.

Character Set and Binary file editing
--------------------------------------
Any of the characters in the IBM extended ASCII set can be entered
and manipulated by TERSE. To enter control characters (ASCII 00-31
and 127), use <Ctrl-@>, <Ctrl-A>, ... , <Ctrl-Z>, <Ctrl-[>, <Ctrl-\>,
<Ctrl-]>, <Ctrl-^>, <Ctrl-_> and <Ctrl-Backspace>. A more general
method is to press the Alt key and, without releasing it, type a
character ASCII decimal value on the numeric keypad. The PC-BIOS
does not support entry of the <Nul> character (00h) in this fashion.
Instead, you may enter the <Nul> character by hitting the <Ctrl @> key.

The ASCII Backspace (BS) code can be entered as <Ctrl-H>, and the
<Backspace> key deletes the character to the left of the cursor.
Similarly, ASCII Carriage-Return (CR) and Line-Feed (LF) character
codes can be entered directly as <Ctrl-M> and <Ctrl-J>. TERSE
interprets the <CR> character as an end-of-line. An <LF> is considered
an ordinary text character except when it is immediately preceded by
a <CR>, in which case it is considered part of the end-of-line marker.
If <CR><LF> are entered together, or ever become adjacent, they cannot
be separated. The <Enter> key inserts an end-of-line marker (CR)(LF).

TERSE does not use the CP/M style End-of-file marker, <Ctrl-Z>, to
indicate the last character in a text file. If a <Ctrl-Z> character
appears in the file, it is shown as is.

The Screen
-----------
TERSE configures itself to the display adapter in use, and supports
text modes other than the standard 80 columns by 25 rows, e.g., EGA
43 lines and CGA 40 columns mode. <PgUp> and <PgDn> scroll the file
by the number of rows displayed. TERSE will not work properly if the
screen is initially in a graphics mode.

TERSE does not alter screen attributes or colors. Inverse video is used
in the status line and to indicate a MARKed block. TERSE uses blinking
inverse video to indicate that the search string has been found.
It automatically handles "de-snow" on a CGA display.

Because TERSE makes BIOS calls and writes directly to the screen
buffer, it would probably not work properly on MS-DOS computers that
are not sufficiently IBM-PC compatible.

The Status Line
---------------
At the bottom of the editing screen is the Status Line. The Status
Line constantly displays information regarding the file you are
currently editing. The Status Line is shown below with a description
of the information displayed.

KNOWN BUGS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
=================================
    o     Horizontal scrolling will not move the cursor position, so by
          pressing <Alt +> and <Alt -> you can scroll to the right
          or to the left but only to the extent which will leave
          the current cursor position visible. For example when the
          cursor is in the left most column, no horizontal scrolling
          is possible. There are no plans for modifying this behavior
          as the author feels that it is very reasonable. Strong user
          pressure may change this.

    o     <Alt-U> will only restore the last character erased by
          <Backspace>. Future plan is to push deleted characters (by
          <DEL>, <Backspace> and overwritten characters) to a stack.
          The stack will have limited depth, and as characters
          are pushed in, old characters stored deeply in the stack
          disappear. The <Alt U> will pop characters from the stack
          and insert/append them.

    o     Editing can get extremely slow if lines are excessively long.
          Lines longer than 20,000 characters will cause a noticeable
          delay after every editing operation on these lines.
