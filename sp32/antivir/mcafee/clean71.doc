SYNOPSIS

     CLEAN-UP (CLEAN) is a virus disinfection program for IBM PC
and compatible computers.  CLEAN-UP will search though the
partition table, boot sector, or files of a PC and remove a virus
specified by the user. In most instances CLEAN-UP is able to repair
the infected area of the system and restore it to normal usage. 
CLEAN-UP works on all viruses identified by the current version of
the VIRUSCAN (SCAN) program.
     CLEAN-UP runs on any PC with 256Kb and DOS version 2.00 or
greater.  

AUTHENTICITY

     CLEAN-UP runs a self-test when executed.  If CLEAN has been
modified in any way, a warning will be displayed.  The program will
still continue to remove viruses, though.  If CLEAN reports that
it has been damaged, is recommended that a new, clean copy be
obtained.
     CLEAN-UP is packaged with the VALIDATE program to ensure the 
integrity of the CLEAN.EXE file.  The VALIDATE.DOC instructions
tell how to use the VALIDATE program.  The VALIDATE program
distributed with CLEAN-UP may be used to check all further versions
of CLEAN.

     The validation results for Version 71 should be:

              FILE NAME: CLEAN.EXE
                   SIZE: 84,869
                   DATE: 11-30-90
    FILE AUTHENTICATION:
         Check Method 1: 2B7D
         Check Method 2: 1BF3

If your copy of CLEAN.EXE differs, it may have been modified. 
Always obtain your copy of CLEAN-UP from a known source.  The
latest version of CLEAN-UP and validation data for SCAN.EXE can be
obtained off of McAfee Associates' bulletin board system 408 988
4004.


WHAT'S NEW

     Version 71 of CLEAN-UP adds disinfection of 6 new viruses, the
Flip virus, KeyPress virus, DataLock virus, Taiwan-3, Taiwan-4 and
the Violator.  For summary information about these viruses, please
refer to the accompanying VIRLIST.TXT file.  For a detailed
description of these viruses please refer to Patricia Hoffman's
VSUM document.  VSUM is copyrighted by Patricia Hoffman.  It is the
most comprehensive PC virus compendium available.

OVERVIEW

     CLEAN-UP searches the system looking for the virus you wish
to remove.  When an infected file is found, CLEAN-UP isolates and
removes the virus, and in most cases, repairs the infected file and
restores it to normal operation.  If the file is infected with a
less common virus, CLEAN-UP will then display a warning message and
prompt the user, asking to overwrite and delete the infected file. 
Files erased in such a manner are non-recoverable.  CLEAN-UP can
identify and delete all 260 known virus variants.
    Verify the suspect virus infection with the VIRUSCAN program
before running CLEAN-UP.  VIRUSCAN will locate and identify the
virus and provide the I.D. code needed to remove it.  The I.D. is
displayed inside the square brackets, "[" and "]."  For example,
the I.D. code for the Jerusalem virus is displayed as
"[Jeru]".  This I.D. must be used with CLEAN-UP to remove the
virus.  The square brackets "[" and "]" MUST be included.

     The common viruses that CLEAN-UP is able to remove
successfully and repair and restore the damaged programs are:

1260           1701             1704           4096          
Alabama        Alameda          Ashar          Dark Avenger   
Disk Killer    EDV              Fish           Invader         
Jerusalem A    Jerusalem B      Jerusalem E    Joshi
Brain          PayDay           Ping Pong B    Slow
Stoned         SunDay           Suriv03        V800          
VacSina        Vienna           Whale          Yankee Doodle 
ZeroBug        Violator         Keypress       DataLock
Flip           Taiwan 3         Taiwan 4


AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT .EXE FILES:  Some viruses which infect .EXE
files can not be removed successfully in all cases.  This usually
occurs when the .EXE file loads internal overlays.  Instead of
attaching to the end of the .EXE file, the virus may attach to the
beginning of the overlay area, and program instructions are
overwritten.  Clean-Up will truncate files infected in this manner.
If a file no longer runs after being cleaned, replace it from the
manufacturer's original disk.

AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE STONED VIRUS:  Removing the Stoned
virus can cause loss of the partition table on systems with
non-standard formatted hard disks.  As a precaution, backup all
critical data before running CLEAN-UP.  Loss of the partition table
can result in the LOSS OF ALL DATA ON THE DISK.

OPERATION:


IMPORTANT NOTE:  POWER DOWN YOUR SYSTEM AND BOOT FROM A CLEAN
SYSTEM DISK BEFORE BEGINNING.  RUN THE CLEAN-UP PROGRAM FROM A
WRITE-PROTECTED DISK TO PREVENT INFECTION OF THE PROGRAM.

     Power down the infected system and boot from a clean,
write-protected system diskette.  This step will insure that the
virus is not in control of the computer and will prevent
reinfection.  After cleaning, power down the system again, reboot
from the system disk, and run the VIRUSCAN program to make sure the
system has been succesfully disinfected.  After cleaning the hard
disk, run the VIRUSCAN program on any floppies that may have been
inserted into the infected system to determine if they have been
infected.
     CLEAN-UP will display the name of the infected file, the virus
found in it, and report a "successful" disinfection when the virus
is removed.  If a file has been infected multiple times by a virus
(possible if the virus does not check to see if it has already
attached to a file) than CLEAN-UP will report that the virus has
been removed successfully for each infection.


     To run CLEAN-UP type:

CLEAN d1: ... d10: [virus I.D.]  /A /E xxx /MANY /REPORT d:filename

Options are:

                   /A - Examine all files for viruses
    /E .xxx .yyy .zzz - Clean overlay extensions .xxx .yyy .zzz
                /MANY - Put CLEAN into loop disinfecting drive(s)
               /NOMEM - Skip memory checking when cleaning
   /REPORT d:filename - Create report of cleaned files

         d1: ... d10: - indicate drives to be cleaned
         [virus I.D.] - Virus identification code, for a complete
                        list of codes, see the accompanying
                        VIRLIST.TXT file                         

     The /A option will cause CLEAN to go through all files on
diskette.  This should be used if a file-infecting virus is
detected.  
     The /E option allows the user to specify an extension or set
of extensions to clean.  Extensions must be separated by a space
after the /E and between each other.  Up to three extensions may
be added with the /E.  For more extensions, use the /A option.
     The /MANY option is used to clean multiple floppy diskettes. 
If the user has more than one floppy disk to check for viruses, the
/MANY option will allows the user to check them without having to
run CLEAN multiple times.
     The /REPORT option is used to generate a listing of
disinfected files.  The resulting list can be saved to disk as an
ASCII text file.  To use the report option, specify /REPORT on the
command line, followed by the device and filename.

VERSION NOTES

Version 67:
     Version 67 is now disinfects the EDV, Invader, Slow, and Whale
viruses.
     The EDV is a boot sector infector virus first reported in
Germany.  It infects hard and floppy disks.  The Invader is a
multipartite (two-piece) virus that attaches to both files and boot
sectors of hard and floppy disks.  The Invader shows up as being
4,096 bytes in length in infected files.  It is NOT related to the 
4096 "Stealth" virus but rather is a combination of the Jerusalem,
Stoned, and Plastique viruses.  At random intervals, it plays
Beethoven over the speaker.
     The Slow virus has been reported at several sites in
Australia.  It is a file infector, attaching to .COM and .EXE files
and increasing them by 1,701 bytes.  It is NOT related to the 1701
virus.
     The Whale virus is a "stealth" type virus that attaches itself
to .COM, .EXE, and overlay files.  It increases their size by
approximately 9.216 bytes, but this size increase will not show up
unless the infected PC is cold booted off of a clean system disk
because the virus masks its presence when resident in memory.
     More information about these viruses may be found in the
accompanying VIRLIST.TXT file.
     A report-generating option has been added to CLEAN-UP.  When
the /REPORT option is used, it will generate a list of infected
files found when scanning an infected system.  Such a report can
be used for pin-pointing the source of an infection, or for system
audits.
