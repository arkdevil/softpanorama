/*									*/
/*	This program is meant for those of us who bought the Norton	*/
/*	Guides and were disappointed by the fact that we couldn't	*/
/*	modify the databases provided for our own purposes (by making	*/
/*	the fatal assumption that "customizing the Guides" included	*/
/*	the ability to customize the published databases).		*/
/*									*/
/*	I have been able to take the databases provided in the Guides,	*/
/*	"un-compile" (split) them into their component parts, and	*/
/*	then re-compile them back into a database using the NGC and	*/
/*	NGML utilities provided with the Guides.  The resulting		*/
/*	database is identical to the original using DOS 'comp'		*/
/*	(except for a six-character difference in the Microsoft C	*/
/*	database, which does not affect execution).			*/
/*									*/
/*	I have tested this program on the Norton Guides for Turbo C	*/
/*	Microsoft C.  Others have tested it on the other published	*/
/*	databases and some public domain ones.  If you find that it	*/
/*	does not work for some database, I will be glad to look at	*/
/*	the code to see if I can get it to work.  I will need a copy	*/
/*	of the database file, however (only for debugging - the		*/
/*	disk(s) will be returned with a copy of the new program).	*/
/*									*/
/*	There are some funny file formats possible which NG_SPLIT	*/
/*	doesn't handle right now.  They will be corrected in V2.0 in	*/
/*	a couple of months.  They do not appear in any of Norton's	*/
/*	databases (as far as I know), but they can be created by the	*/
/*	NG software.  Please send me a copy of anything that NG_SPLIT	*/
/*	can't handle, so I can make sure that everything is covered.	*/
/*	Included in V2 or V3 will be a utility to re-write the funny	*/
/*	source code into something more reasonable, since usually the	*/
/*	strange formats mess up the operation of the grey + key.	*/
/*									*/
/*	If you like this program and would like to see more like	*/
/*	it, please contribute whatever you think this program is	*/
/*	worth to you (recommended $5 or $10).  Thank you.		*/

/*	ng_split		Version 1.2		12 August 1988	*/
/*									*/
/*	Purpose:	Split a Norton Guides .ng database into		*/
/*			its original component source files		*/
/*									*/
/*	Syntax:		ng_split db_name				*/
/*	Where:		'db_name' = the name of the Norton Guides	*/
/*			database (with or without the .ng suffix)	*/
/*									*/
/*	Restrictions:	1)  The NG database must be located in your	*/
/*			    current working directory.			*/
/*			2)  The database must not be "active" when	*/
/*			    you run ng_split.  You must either		*/
/*			    uninstall the Guides or copy the database	*/
/*			    to a different (work) directory first.	*/
/*			3)  Due to the intensive character I/O, you	*/
/*			    should run from your RAMdisk, if possible.	*/
/*									*/
/*	Remarks:	ng_split will create several files in your	*/
/*			current working directory :			*/
/*									*/
/*		'db_name':	the menu link control file		*/
/*		'db_name'.bat:	a batch file containing the commands	*/
/*			to re-create the database			*/
/*		'dbxx'_000:	the individual source data files are	*/
/*			named 'dbxx'_000 through 'dbxx'_999, depending	*/
/*			on how many files are needed.  Note : 'dbxx'	*/
/*			is the first four characters of 'db_name'.	*/
/*		temp:	a temporary file which is deleted on exit	*/
/*									*/
/*	For example : if you are splitting the Turbo C database tc.ng,	*/
/*		you would use the command:	ng_split tc		*/
/*		which would create files:	tc			*/
/*						tc.bat			*/
/*						tc_000 through tc_011	*/
/*						temp (deleted)		*/
/*									*/
/*	Change history:							*/
/*		V 1.0 - 17 June 88 - original program			*/
/*		V 1.1 - 18 July 88 - allow databases with names longer	*/
/*				than six characters or with more than	*/
/*				26 source files and update docs		*/
/*		V 1.2 - 12 August 88 - fix bug with !short with no data	*/
/*				following it and !file.  also added	*/
/*				status lines and better error messages	*/
/*									*/

/*									*/
/*	Hints on interpreting error messages :				*/
/*									*/
/*	In general, all error messages indicate that NG_SPLIT was	*/
/*	unable to successfully split your database.  In those cases,	*/
/*	I would appreciate it if you could send me a copy of the	*/
/*	database, so I can correct the program.  There are two error	*/
/*	messages, however, which I can do nothing about :		*/
/*									*/
/*	Write error - possibly out of disk space			*/
/*		- this indicates that either you are out of space	*/
/*		  OR your directory cannot hold any more files.		*/
/*									*/
/*	WARNING - Database error					*/
/*		- this one comes up if there is an error in the		*/
/*		  database itself.  It occurs when it is trying to	*/
/*		  locate a !seealso segment and the database contains	*/
/*		  an illegal address.  You can verify this by looking	*/
/*		  at the output file which contains the error and	*/
/*		  searching for the string :		_???.ngo:	*/
/*		  Make note of the name of the faulty !seealso clause	*/
/*		  ( the name in quotes after the colon ) and the name	*/
/*		  of the !short section which contains it ( backward	*/
/*		  search for !short: ).  Next, look at the menu link	*/
/*		  control file ( same name as the database, but without	*/
/*		  the .ng suffix ) and look for the name of the output	*/
/*		  file which contained the error.  Make note of the	*/
/*		  menu heading and the menu item which corresponds to	*/
/*		  that file.  Now, bring up the database and find the	*/
/*		  menu heading and menu item.  Then, look up the name	*/
/*		  of the !short item you located before.  You will	*/
/*		  notice that it has a !seealso item with the faulty	*/
/*		  clause name.  If you try to select that !seealso	*/
/*		  clause, nothing will happen.  I don't know why this	*/
/*		  happens and have only seen it happen in one database	*/
/*		  If I get several different databases with this	*/
/*		  problem, I may be able to find a pattern and find a	*/
/*		  way to correct the database and the source files.	*/
/*									*/
/*		  Of course, the above instructions to verify the	*/
/*		  database error are a little more complicated if the	*/
/*		  error is in a !file instead of a !short called from	*/
/*		  the menu, but its the same principle - its just a	*/
/*		  little more work to find out which !short the error	*/
/*		  is in.						*/
/*									*/
