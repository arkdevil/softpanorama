The e-zine published by "System programming seminar" which was the most
influencial informal programmers' forum on the territory of USSR in the
last Soviet - first post-Soviet years.

Some popular DOS software were first debuted to the wide auditory here:
AVP, Adinf, HIEW, Volkov commander and of course (Win)RAR.

All texts were converted to utf-8 for easy indexing and auto-translation,
all nested archives extracted, all false positives from virustotal.com checked,
all but [sp51](sp51/criptwar) encrypted distributives cracked:
[sp41](sp41/criptwar/kurkovsk), [sp42](sp42/criptwar), [sp45](sp45/benefic/marinov),
[sp47](sp47/criptwar/krupnik), [sp54](sp54/forum/c-club/martynov),
[sp55](sp55/benefic/krupnik/cript), [sp57](sp57/forum/potapkin).

As conversion is semi-automatic, some files, like configuration or help files,
could have been erroneously translated. In this case, please open the github issue
and get the original files from the [original archives folder](sparc) as a temporary workaround.
