This file provides information for shareware disk vendors and user
groups on the distribution of 4DOS.

We are glad to work with you in the distribution of our product, as user
groups and disk vendors are an important part of the shareware distribu-
tion system.

Before placing 4DOS or any part of the 4DOS package in any shareware or
other disk library, or distributing shareware copies for a fee in any
way, you must meet one of these conditions:

   * If you are a U.S.-based shareware disk vendor, you must be an ap-
   proved member of the Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP),
   and your application must be fully approved in writing by the ASP,
   not simply submitted or awaiting review.  If you are not an ASP mem-
   ber, we cannot currently offer you permission to distribute our prod-
   ucts.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you, but we
   have found that the administrative overhead required to handle non-
   ASP vendors from within the U.S. is simply too high.

   * If you are a U.S.-based, non-profit, tax-exempt user group, you may
   place a shareware copy of 4DOS in your library without prior written
   permission, provided you obtain a diskette copy from another vendor
   (not a downloaded copy), and notify us in writing within 15 days of
   doing so.

   * If you are a disk vendor based outside the U.S., you must either be
   an ASP member, or you must obtain prior written permission from us
   before distributing 4DOS.

If you meet one of these criteria would like to carry 4DOS, you may
obtain it from another vendor if the other vendor has received their
copy directly from us.  If you prefer to distribute shareware obtained
directly from the author, please write us and we will send you 4DOS on
diskette at no charge.  In either case, please send us a copy of your
catalog for our files.

PLEASE NOTE:  JP SOFTWARE DOES NOT PERMIT RETAIL RACK DISTRIBUTION OF
4DOS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  If you use retail racks, please do NOT
contact us for approval of rack distribution, as it will be denied!  CD-
ROM DISTRIBUTION IS ALSO PROHIBITED without our express, written permis-
sion, and new permission is required for each new release.  These prohi-
bitions apply even if you are distributing diskette copies of one or
more of our products, or have distributed our products via rack or CD-
ROM in the past.

Non-ASP vendors who wish to consider becoming ASP approved can obtain
information from:

           Association of Shareware Professionals
           545 Grover Road
           Muskegon, MI 49442-9427
