                                   A Guided Tour Of 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4DOS/NT
        -------------------------------------------------------------------


        A GUIDED TOUR OF 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4DOS/NT


        This tour will acquaint you with some of the features of 4DOS,
        4OS2, and 4DOS/NT.  It isn't a substitute for the manuals, but it
        will help you understand how familiar our products seem if you are
        used to working at the traditional command prompt.  At the same
        time, it will introduce you to many of our most popular features
        and enhancements.  By the time you finish this guided tour, you
        will have a feeling for how easy and friendly 4DOS, 4OS2, and
        4DOS/NT are compared to the traditional command processor.

        This tour is designed to be used interactively.  Sit down at your
        computer with the manual.  Each time an example is shown, try it.
        The tour will create all of the files it uses;  it won't modify or
        change your existing files and subdirectories at all.  Each section
        of the tour is self-contained so you can skip any sections you wish
        and return to them later.

        You'll need to refer to this tour documentation while you go
        through each step of the tour.  To print this document, just use
        the following command:

                  copy tour.doc prn

        (The file is already formatted with headers, footers, and page
        breaks, so printing it with a program that formats the pages may
        not work.)


        Starting The Tour

             Before you can start the tour, you need to install your new
             command processor.  If you haven't done so yet, see the
             Introduction and Installation Guide for instructions.

             If you have a diskette copy of 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4DOS/NT, select
             "Tour Installation" from the INSTALL menu to copy the
             necessary files to your disk without making any modifications
             to your system configuration files.  If you have already done
             a full installation and 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4DOS/NT is running on
             your system, just skip the step below where the command
             "4DOS", "4OS2", or "4NT" is entered.

             If you have a downloaded copy of one of our products, just
             extract the downloaded files to a new directory on your hard
             disk, and follow the directions below.

                                   A Guided Tour Of 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4DOS/NT
        -------------------------------------------------------------------

             During the course of the tour, we'll ask you to enter several
             commands.  Your entries are shown here in lower case, but you
             can type in either upper or lower case.

             The screen displays during the tour may look slightly
             different on your system, depending on how your prompt is set
             up, what disk drive you're using, and what files are in your
             installation directory.  Don't worry about any minor
             differences.

             In some cases, the computer's output will be too long to fit
             on a line of this manual and remain readable.  We've truncated
             those lines and placed three dots [...] at the end to show you
             that the actual line displayed on your screen will be longer.
             Some commands create more lines of output than we need to
             display here to show how they work.  We've put a line of nine
             dots [... ... ...] in those locations to indicate that
             additional information will be shown on your screen.

             We've written the tour as if you were using 4DOS, because it's
             our most popular product.  The few minor differences in 4OS2
             and 4DOS/NT are noted in the text.

             To start the tour, first change to the directory where 4DOS,
             4OS2, or 4DOS/NT was installed, using the CD command.  For
             example, if you've used the directory C:\4DOS, enter the
             following command:

                  C:\> cd 4dos
                  C:\4DOS>

             Now start 4DOS by typing:

                  C:\4DOS> 4dos

             (If you are using 4OS2, type 4OS2;  if you are using 4DOS/NT,
             type 4NT.  If you have already performed a full installation,
             skip this step.)

             You'll see a sign-on message that looks similar to this:

                  4DOS EMS swapping initialized (128K)

                  Registered for use on a single computer.

             and then a prompt like this:

                  c:\4dos>

                                   A Guided Tour Of 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4DOS/NT
        -------------------------------------------------------------------

             Depending on how your prompt was previously defined, you may
             now see it in lower case, which many people find easier to
             read.  A lower case prompt is the default, and we'll show the
             prompt that way throughout the tour.  Once you have 4DOS,
             4OS2, or 4DOS/NT fully installed you can use the PROMPT
             command to change the prompt to upper case if you prefer.

             If you want to exit at any time, just type the command EXIT at
             the prompt and press Enter.  This will return you to the
             traditional DOS, OS/2, or Windows NT command line:

                  c:\4dos> exit
                  C:\4DOS>


        Basic Commands

             We'll begin the tour by demonstrating some of the most common,
             and most familiar, commands.  We'll also show you some of the
             enhancements that we've added to those commands to make your
             computing easier.

             First, enter the single-character command ?.  You'll see a
             display like this:

                  c:\4dos> ?
                  ?           ALIAS       ATTRIB      BEEP        ...
                  CANCEL      CD          CDD         CHCP        ...
                  COLOR       COPY        CTTY        DATE        ...
                  DESCRIBE    DIR         DIRS        DRAWBOX     ...
                       ... ... ...
                  UNALIAS     UNSET       VER         VERIFY      ...
                  Y

             The ? command displays a list of all the commands built into
             your new command processor.  You certainly don't have to
             memorize them all -- we'll show you how to get help with any
             command in a few moments.  Nor are we going to demonstrate all
             of these commands in this tour.  If you want complete
             information about a command, turn to the alphabetic Command
             Reference in the Reference Manual.

             Now try a DIR command to see a list of files in the current
             directory.  DIR displays a list of file names, sizes, dates,
             and times:

                  c:\4dos> dir

                   Volume in drive C is JPS_TEST    Serial number is ...
                   Directory of  c:\4dos\*.*

             The DIR display should look familiar.  But, unlike the
             traditional DIR display, you'll see the file names in lower
             case and in alphabetical order.  We also give you some totals
             at the end of the display that help you see how much space
             your files are using.

             By using some of DIR's options, you can make the display
             easier to read.  The directory display you just saw probably
             didn't fit on your screen.  You can tell DIR to pause at the
             end of each page by using the command DIR /P.  The /P is an
             example of a switch or option which modifies the behavior of a
             command:

                  c:\4dos> dir /p

                   Volume in drive C is JPS_TEST    Serial number is ...

             You might prefer to display directories in 2 columns.  DIR
             will do that if you include the /2 option.  If you add the /V
             option, it will perform a vertical sort, with file names
             running alphabetically down the first column and then down the

             DIR has many other formatting and file selection options.
             You'll use a few below;  all of them are explained under the
             DIR command in your Reference Manual.

             Next, you'll use a simple batch file called TOUR1.BTM to
             create a dummy file.  (A .BTM batch file is similar to a
             traditional .BAT or .CMD batch file, but faster.)  To run
             TOUR1.BTM, enter the command:

                  c:\4dos> tour1

             This batch file creates a small file called FILE1 in your
             current directory.  The contents of the file aren't important;
             we're simply using it to demonstrate some file-handling
             capabilities.  You can verify that FILE1 has been created by
             using DIR again.

             Now use the COPY command to copy the contents of FILE1 to a
             new file, FILE2:

                  c:\4dos> copy file1 file2
                  c:\4dos\file1 => c:\4dos\file2
                       1 file(s) copied

             The copy was performed just like the traditional COPY command.
             You may notice that the output is a little friendlier: COPY

             tells you exactly what file it copied and where it copied the
             file to, along with a count of files at the end.

             Now try renaming a file.  If you've used the traditional
             RENAME command or its synonym REN, this will look familiar:

                  c:\4dos> ren file1 file3
                  c:\4dos\file1 -> c:\4dos\file3
                       1 file(s) renamed

             Like COPY, the REN command tells you just what it did.  You
             now have two files, FILE2 and FILE3, in the current directory.
             You can use another enhancement to add the extension .TST to
             both of them:

                  c:\4dos> ren file2 file3 *.tst
                  c:\4dos\file2 -> c:\4dos\file2.tst
                  c:\4dos\file3 -> c:\4dos\file3.tst
                       2 file(s) renamed

             Unlike the traditional REN command, our enhanced version lets
             you rename multiple files with a single command.  All file
             processing commands like COPY, DEL, MOVE, and RENAME accept
             multiple file names, so you can do in one command what used to
             require a separate command for each file.

             Now delete the files you have just created.  You could use a
             simple command like DEL *.TST, but that would delete any other
             .TST files in the current directory also.  To protect against
             erasing files that you might want to keep, add a /P option to
             DEL so that it will prompt you before it deletes each file.
             Answer Y to the prompts shown below to delete your test files:

                  c:\4dos> del *.tst /p
                  Delete c:\4dos\file3.tst (Y/N/R)? y
                  Delete c:\4dos\file2.tst (Y/N/R)? y
                       2 file(s) deleted          4,096 bytes freed

             To verify all these actions, you can do a DIR or DIR /P to
             look at what files are left in the directory.  All the files
             you've just created (FILE1, FILE2, FILE3, FILE2.TST, and
             FILE3.TST) should be gone.

             The features we've demonstrated here -- traditional commands
             with enhancements that make your work easier -- are present
             throughout 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4DOS/NT.  If you want more details,
             pick a traditional  command that you're familiar with and look
             up the corresponding command in the Reference Manual to get an
             idea of what's new and improved.  (Remember that 4DOS, 4OS2,

             and 4DOS/NT only replace internal commands like COPY and DIR,
             not external commands like DISKCOPY and FORMAT.)


        Command Line Editing and History

             This section demonstrates features which make it easy to
             correct typing mistakes at the system prompt, to repeat
             previous commands, and to get help with any command.

             We can't show you exact examples here as easily as we can in
             the other sections of the tour, since the display depends on
             the exact keystrokes you type and we want you to experiment a
             little.  So we'll guide you through what you can do, and
             you'll see the results on your screen.

             First, create a typing error on purpose.  Enter an incorrect
             DIR command:

                  c:\4dos> dur /2

             Traditionally, you would have had to use the Backspace key to
             erase most of the line in order to correct this error, or
             press Esc and start over.  Command line editing makes
             corrections much easier.  Press the Home key followed by the
             right arrow.  The cursor will move to the start of the line
             and then right one space to the "u" in "dur".  Type an "i" and
             the command should be correct.  To execute it, press Enter;
             if you'd rather not, press Esc.

             That's a simple example of command line editing.  You can use
             the left and right arrow keys, Home and End, and Backspace and
             Del to move around and modify your command line at any time,
             just like you do in your word processor or editor.  Other keys
             let you move the cursor a word at a time, delete words, change
             between overstrike and insert modes, and perform many other
             operations.  Esc always clears the line and lets you start
             over.  (For a summary of all the command line editing keys,
             see your Reference Manual).

             4DOS and its cousins also remember the commands you type in a
             command history.  We'll use the HISTORY command to display the
             commands that you have used so far during this tour:

                  c:\4dos> history
                  ?
                  dir
                  dir /p
                  dir /2/v
                  tour1

        -------------------------------------------------------------------

                  ren file1 file3
                  ren file2 file3 *.tst
                  del *.tst /p
                  dir /2

             You are normally limited to about 1000 characters of history,
             but you can reduce or enlarge this amount to suit your own
             needs.

             Now press the up-arrow key once.  The last command in the
             HISTORY display (DIR /2 in the example above) will appear at
             the prompt.  You can use the editing keys to modify this
             command, which is much easier than retyping it.  To execute
             the command again, in either its modified or unmodified form,
             press Enter.  To clear the line, press Esc.

             If you'd like to see more commands, first press Esc to clear
             the command line. (To see all commands in the history, you
             should always start with an empty command line.)  Now press
             up-arrow several times.  Each time you press it, you will back
             up one more line in the command history.  Once you find the
             line you're looking for, you can modify it if you like and
             then press Enter to execute it.

             Now imagine that you have been working for a while.  An hour
             ago you did a complex DIR command and you need to do it again.
             You could scroll through an hour's worth of command history.
             But another feature called command completion will save you
             time.

             First, type the beginning of the command -- DI, or DIR.  Now
             press the up-arrow.  This will recall the newest command in
             the history that starts with the characters you typed (if
             there are no matches, you'll hear a beep).  Press up-arrow
             again to retrieve the command before that, still matching to
             the characters you originally typed.

             You can try this feature now using DI or DIR, because you've
             put several DIR commands into the command history during the
             tour.

             Perhaps you would prefer to look at a list of commands that
             you have entered and choose from the list.  First press the
             Esc key to clear the command prompt.  Then press the PgUp key.
             You will see a history window in the upper right corner of
             your screen showing the commands you've recently typed.  You
             can move around in this window with the up-arrow and down-
             arrow keys.  PgUp and PgDn scroll the display a page at a
             time.  When you find the command you want, press Enter to re-

             execute it as is, or press Ctrl-Enter to move the line to the
             prompt where you can edit it as usual.

             You can also get help any time you need it from the command
             prompt.  Just press the F1 key.

             If you're using 4DOS, you'll see a display of all of the HELP
             topics when you press F1.  If you would like some help with
             COPY, move the cursor bar to COPY, or just type COPY and 4DOS
             will move the bar for you.  Press Enter to see help on the
             topic;  once you're there, scroll through the help using the
             vertical arrows or PgUp and PgDn keys.  The highlighted items
             within a topic are cross-references to other topics;  select
             one with the horizontal arrow keys and press Enter to view it.
             Press Esc or F1 to return to the topic list.

             For more help using the 4DOS Help display, select the Help
             topic at the beginning of the topic list.  If you have a
             mouse, see the Mouse topic near the beginning of the topic
             list.

             Under 4OS2, F1 will start OS/2's standard VIEW.EXE help
             program.  If you aren't familiar with VIEW, click on the Help
             button on the menu bar for additional information.  You can
             navigate through the help system with the mouse or keyboard,
             using standard OS/2 conventions.

             Under 4DOS/NT, F1 will start the standard Windows help
             program.  Use the Help button on the menu bar for additional
             information.  You can navigate through the help system with
             the mouse or keyboard, using standard Windows conventions.

             Now exit the help system (double click on the "close" box in
             the upper left corner of the window, or use the Esc key in
             4DOS).   Then start entering a command:

                  c:\4dos> copy *.doc a: /

             After that "/" you want to use the option that tells COPY to
             prompt you before replacing an existing file, but you can't
             remember what it is.  Just leave the command as it is and
             press F1.  The help system will display help on the command
             you're entering, and you'll see that the option you want is
             /R.  Exit the help system and you'll be right back on the
             command line.  You can type the R and press Enter to execute
             your command, or press Esc instead to clear the line if you
             don't really want to execute the command.

        -------------------------------------------------------------------

             There are may more features that can help you at the command
             line.  Most of them are described in Chapter 3 / Using 4DOS,
             4OS2, and 4DOS/NT, in your Reference Manual.


        More About Files

             This section of the tour lets you explore some additional
             features that will help you manage files and directories.
             You're about to use another batch file, TOUR2.BTM, to create
             some files with which you can experiment.  First, take a look
             at the batch file with the LIST command:

                  c:\4dos> list tour2.btm

             As you can see on your screen, LIST is a full screen file
             viewer.  You can scroll and page through the text.  You may
             notice that some lines near the end of the file extend beyond
             the edge of your screen.  To make the off-screen text visible
             use the left and right arrows to scroll the display
             horizontally, or press W to turn line wrapping on and off.
             LIST also lets you search for text and print the file you're
             viewing, two capabilities that we won't demonstrate on this
             tour.  The file TOUR2.BTM is simply a batch file that creates
             other files, using the ECHO command.  You don't have to worry
             about how it works;  we just used it to show you LIST.  Press
             Esc to exit List and return to the command line.

             Now run TOUR2.BTM:

                  c:\4dos> tour2

                  Please wait ...

                  File creation completed

             TOUR2 creates three files called FILE1, FILE2, and FILE3.  The
             contents of the files aren't important since we're just using
             them for demonstration purposes.  You'll be deleting and
             recreating them several times during the rest of the tour.

             Now try the SELECT feature.  SELECT lets you choose files for
             any 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4DOS/NT command from a full-screen list.
             We'll use it here to delete one of the files that TOUR2
             created.  Enter the command:

                  c:\4dos> select del (file*)




        -------------------------------------------------------------------
        Copyright 1993, JP Software Inc.                                 10

                                   A Guided Tour Of 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4DOS/NT
        -------------------------------------------------------------------

             This command lets you select from files that begin with the
             characters "file", and then pass the name of each file you
             select to the DEL command for action.

             The display on your screen includes a two-line header and then
             the list of files, just as they'd look in a directory display.
             Press the spacebar to "mark" the first file -- a triangular
             mark will appear to the left of the file name.  You can scroll
             around in the display and mark and unmark files with the
             spacebar as you like.  When you hit Enter, the command will be
             executed, deleting the files you've marked.  For now, mark
             FILE1 and leave the other files unmarked, so that FILE2 and
             FILE3 are not deleted.  You'll use them in the next step.

             SELECT is also handy if you want to copy a group of files to a
             floppy disk, perhaps to take your work home for the night or
             to make a quick backup.  If you'd like to try it, put a blank,
             formatted floppy disk in drive A.  Then enter this command:

                  c:\4dos> select copy (file*) a:

             Mark one or both of the files in the SELECT display, and the
             marked files will be copied to the floppy disk when you hit
             Enter.

             SELECT is a "prefix" command: it goes before another command
             and modifies what that second command does.  Another useful
             prefix command is EXCEPT, which lets you do something except
             to one or more files.  Before you try EXCEPT, create new
             copies of FILE1, FILE2, and FILE3 (TOUR2 will overwrite any
             old copies of these files remaining from the last time it was
             run):

                  c:\4dos> tour2

                  Please wait ...

                  File creation completed

             Now use EXCEPT to delete all but one of the files that TOUR2
             created:

                  c:\4dos> except (file1) del file*
                  Deleting c:\4dos\file2
                  Deleting c:\4dos\file3
                       2 file(s) deleted          4,096 bytes freed

             The EXCEPT command protected FILE1 from being deleted.  To
             verify that, use the DIR command.  When you're done, run TOUR2
             one more time so the files are there for the next step.

        -------------------------------------------------------------------

        -------------------------------------------------------------------

             Next, create two subdirectories within the current directory:

                  c:\4dos> md dira dirb

             Notice that you can create both subdirectories with a single
             command.  Traditionally, you would have needed two MD commands
             to do the same thing.  To verify that the directories are
             there, use DIR but ask it to display only subdirectories and
             not files (if you're curious, /A:D stands for "Attributes:
             Directory"):

                  c:\4dos> dir /a:d

                   Volume in drive C is JPS_TEST  Serial number is ...
                   Directory of  c:\4dos\*.*

                  .            <DIR>      8-22-91  14:21
                  ..           <DIR>      8-22-91  14:21
                  DIRA         <DIR>     11-03-93  10:23
                  DIRB         <DIR>     11-03-93  10:23
                             0 bytes in 4 file(s)         0 bytes allocated
                    18,608,128 bytes free

             OK, things look right.  Now move the demonstration files to
             those directories, using the built-in MOVE command.  This is
             what you should type to move FILE1 to DIRA, and FILE2 and
             FILE3 to DIRB:

                  c:\4dos> move file1 dira
                  c:\4dos\file1 -> c:\4dos\dira\file1
                       1 file(s) moved

                  c:\4dos> move file2 file3 dirb
                  c:\4dos\file2 -> c:\4dos\dirb\file2
                  c:\4dos\file3 -> c:\4dos\dirb\file3
                       2 file(s) moved

             As usual, you can see exactly what has happened.

             Now that you've created a subdirectory structure, it's time to
             get a comprehensive look at it.  Use DIR to look for all the
             files whose names begin with "file" in the current directory
             and all of its subdirectories -- that's the DIR /S option:

                  c:\4dos> dir /s file*

                   Volume in drive C is JPS_TEST    Serial number is ...
                   Directory of  c:\4dos\dira\file*.*

             DIR has displayed the directory header, filenames, and totals
             for each of the two subdirectories that contain files matching
             the name you entered, FILE*.  It also has displayed a grand
             total.

             You've seen that DIR can look at several subdirectories at
             once.  Now do the same thing with DEL, and delete the files
             you put in your demonstration subdirectories, along with the
             subdirectories themselves, with a single command.  To do so,
             you need to use two options: /S and /X.  The first option
             tells DEL to delete files in the current directory and all of
             its subdirectories.  The /X option makes DEL remove each
             subdirectory if all the files within it are deleted:

                  c:\4dos> del /s/x dira dirb
                  c:\4dos\dira\*.* : Are you sure (Y/N/R)? Y
                  Deleting c:\4dos\dira\file1
                  c:\4dos\dirb\*.* : Are you sure (Y/N/R)? Y
                  Deleting c:\4dos\dirb\file2
                  Deleting c:\4dos\dirb\file3
                       3 file(s) deleted          6,144 bytes freed

             Note the safety feature here.  When you tell DEL to delete
             DIRA and DIRB, they are recognized as directory names.  DEL
             assumes you mean "delete all files in this directory."  Since
             you're deleting all the files, DEL displays a prompt that
             tells you what's about to be deleted and asks you whether you
             really want to do the deletion.  Once you answer Y, the files
             are deleted and the subdirectory is automatically removed
             because you used the /X switch.

                                   A Guided Tour Of 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4DOS/NT
        -------------------------------------------------------------------

             4DOS, 4OS2, and 4DOS/NT also let you use file descriptions, so
             you can describe a file's contents more clearly than with an
             8-character file name.  The descriptions can be up to 40
             characters long by default, and may be extended up to 200
             characters if you wish..

             First, run TOUR2 again to regenerate the three demonstration
             files.  Then use the DESCRIBE command to create a description
             for each file (you can enter any description you like; you
             don't have to use the text shown):

                  c:\4dos> tour2
                  c:\4dos> describe file*
                  Describe "c:\4dos\file1" : Tour file 1
                  Describe "c:\4dos\file2" : Tour file 2
                  Describe "c:\4dos\file3" : Tour file 3

             Now look at the descriptions with a DIR command:

                  c:\4dos> dir file*

                   Volume in drive C is JPS_TEST    Serial number is ...
                   Directory of  c:\4dos\file*.*

                  file1              22  11-03-93  10:48 Tour file 1
                  file2              22  11-03-93  10:48 Tour file 2
                  file3            1938  11-03-93  10:49 Tour file 3
                         1,982 bytes in 3 file(s)     6,144 bytes allocated
                    18,604,032 bytes free

             The descriptions will appear any time you ask for a standard,
             single-column directory display.  They will also appear when
             you use the SELECT command.  They can be a lifesaver when you
             have files whose contents you can't remember, or when you have
             large groups of files with similar names.


        Directory Navigation

             4DOS, 4OS2, and 4DOS/NT don't just make it easier to access
             files;  they also make your life much easier when you're
             navigating through the hard disk directory structure.  You're
             probably already familiar with the traditional CD command,
             which you use to change directories.  We've added a "go back"
             option to CD, which is invoked by using the minus sign [-]
             instead of a directory name.  Try this:

                  c:\4dos> cd \
                  c:\> cd -
                  c:\4dos>

        -------------------------------------------------------------------
        Copyright 1993, JP Software Inc.                                 14

                                   A Guided Tour Of 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4DOS/NT
        -------------------------------------------------------------------

             The CD - changes back to the directory you were in before the
             most recent CD command.  It's a convenient way to switch back
             and forth between two directories.  (Make sure you type at
             least one space between CD and the minus sign.)

             You can also change the drive and directory at the same time
             with the CDD command so you don't have to switch drives first
             and then change directories.  Here's an example using CDD.
             Before you try it, put a floppy disk in drive A:

                  c:\4dos> cdd a:\
                  a:\> cdd -
                  c:\4dos>

             As you can see, the minus works with CDD as well.

             For more complex sequences of directory navigation, you can
             use PUSHD and POPD.  These commands maintain a directory
             "stack" and let you make several changes, then move back
             through the directories you've been to.  They can change both
             drive and directory, like CDD.  For example:

                  c:\4dos> pushd a:\
                  a:\> pushd c:\
                  c:\> popd
                  a:\> popd
                  c:\4dos>

             Now press Ctrl-PgUp (hold down the Ctrl key and then press the
             PgUp key).  You'll see a directory history window in the upper
             right corner of your screen showing the directories you have
             visited recently.  You can move around this window with the
             same keys as you used in the history window, earlier.  When
             you find a directory that you want to move to, press Enter to
             change to it.  You can also press Ctrl-Enter to move the
             directory name to the command line for editing.

             We also offer you a special environment variable, CDPATH, to
             help you find the right directory without a lot of typing.
             CD, CDD, and PUSHD use CDPATH to find the subdirectory you
             want to change to if they can't find it in the current
             directory.  This can help a lot when you have long but
             commonly used directory names.  For example, say you have a
             directory called C:\DBASE\REPORTS which contains a
             subdirectory for each month of the year.  If you set CDPATH
             like this:

                  c:\4dos> set cdpath=c:\dbase\reports

             Then you can change to the JANUARY subdirectory like this:

        -------------------------------------------------------------------

                  c:\4dos> cd january
                  c:\dbase\reports\january> cd -
                  c:\4dos>

             CD found the JANUARY subdirectory, saving you from typing the
             entire name, because its parent directory was listed in
             CDPATH.


        Aliases

             Aliases are one of the most powerful features in 4DOS, 4OS2,
             and 4DOS/NT.  Simple aliases are very easy to set up and use
             (that's what we'll discuss here).  Complex aliases allow you
             to configure your system just about any way you want, and can
             take the place of many small batch files.

             The purpose of an alias is to rename or reconfigure a command.
             Aliases are defined and viewed with the ALIAS command.  In
             this tour, we'll show you how to set up aliases for the DIR
             command.  Of course, you can use aliases to enhance any
             command;  for more examples see the ALIAS command in the
             Reference Manual, and the sample file ALIASES that comes with
             your product.

             Here's a popular favorite for anyone who uses DIR and wants to
             be able to use a simple D instead:

                  c:\4dos> alias d = dir

             To see what aliases you've defined, enter ALIAS with no
             parameters:

                  c:\4dos> alias
                  d=dir

             To use the alias, just enter its name at the prompt, like any
             command:

                  c:\4dos> d

                   Volume in drive C is JPS_TEST    Serial number is ...
                   Directory of  c:\4dos\*.*

             Once you've defined an alias, you can use it anywhere a
             command can be used: at the command prompt, in a batch file,
             or inside another alias.

             As an example, build on the D alias you have already defined.
             Suppose you regularly use 2-column directory listings,
             discussed near the start of the tour.  Each time you want a
             directory listing, you use the command DIR /2.  Define an
             alias, D2, to let you execute this command with the touch of a
             couple of keys.  Since you have already defined D, you can
             define D2 in either of these ways (choose one to try):

                  c:\4dos> alias d2 = dir /2
                  c:\4dos> alias d2 = d /2

             If you want to see the results, just enter ALIAS again:

                  c:\4dos> alias
                  d=dir
                  d2=d /2

             To use this alias, just type the command D2 and press Enter.
             You can pass file names to these aliases just like you would
             to the original command.  For example, D2 *.DOC will give you
             a 2-column display of the .DOC files.

             You can create aliases that are even easier to use with
             keystroke aliases.  These aliases let you assign an Alt or
             Function key to an alias so you can invoke it by pressing a
             single key.  Say you'd like to assign the 2-column directory
             display to F5.  Just define an alias like D2 above, and make
             the alias name the key name, with an at-sign [@] before it:

                  c:\4dos> alias @f5 = dir /2

             Now press F5 and the DIR /2 command will appear on the command
             line.  Press Enter to execute it, or type some additional
             arguments and then press Enter if you'd like.  (You can also
             make key aliases execute as soon as you press the key.  For
             details on how, see the Reference Manual)

             You can use an alias to redefine how a standard command works,
             without changing its name.  Suppose you always want DIR to

             display its output in 2 columns, with a vertical sort and a
             pause at the end of each page.  You might think of using
             something like this:

                  c:\4dos> alias dir = dir /2/p/v

             Go ahead and try that, then do a DIR.  You'll get an error:

                  c:\4dos> dir
                  Alias loop
                  c:\4dos>

             The "alias loop" error is caused because the DIR command
             inside your alias is interpreted as another attempt to run the
             same alias.  It's easy to change the alias so this doesn't
             happen:

                  c:\4dos> alias dir = *dir /2/p/v

             definition with up-arrow and modify it).  Then do a DIR and
             you'll see the results.  Using this method, you can redefine
             the default options for any internal command.

             Aliases can contain multiple commands and can do much fancier
             things than what you've seen here.  They're great for creating
             shorthand names for commonly used programs like your word
             processor or database, and they will often help get programs
             loaded faster as well -- if you put the full name of the
             program in an alias, there's no need to search your PATH for
             it.


        Other Commands

             There are a few other commands that we'll just touch on, so
             that you can see some of the other capabilities of 4DOS, 4OS2,
             and 4DOS/NT.

             First, turn on the LOG facility, which records all the
             commands you enter.  Enter the command:

                  c:\4dos> log /w mylog

             You won't see anything else happen, but you've turned logging
             on.  We'll return to the log later.

             A couple of commands let you control screen color.  The
             examples here will work on any system with a color video board

        -------------------------------------------------------------------

             (the commands work on monochrome systems, too, but you're
             restricted to the colors white and black).  Try clearing the
             screen to a specific color:

                  c:\4dos> cls bright white on magenta

             Now let's set a different color:

                  c:\4dos> color bright yellow on blue

             The behavior of the COLOR command varies depending on which
             product you are using.  Under 4DOS, if you don't have an ANSI
             driver loaded COLOR will change the color of the entire screen
             immediately.  If you do have an ANSI driver loaded, COLOR only
             affects the color of text displayed after it's executed, and
             not the color of text already on the screen.  If you don't
             know, don't worry about it -- just experiment with COLOR and
             see.

             Under 4OS2 COLOR affects the color of text displayed after
             it's executed, but won't change the screen color immediately.
             Under 4DOS/NT, COLOR will change the color of the text on the
             screen, and the color of subsequent output as well.

             The FREE and MEMORY commands help you keep track of system
             resources.  FREE tells you about free space on your disk
             drives (and is much faster than CHKDSK).  MEMORY tells you
             about memory resources, including expanded and extended memory
             and internal alias and history storage areas.  Here are
             examples of the output from our test system;  try the commands
             on your system and see what values you get.

                  c:\4dos> free

             The TIMER command lets you time events.  The following line
             also shows that 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4DOS/NT can accept multiple
             commands on one line.  (As shown below, the standard command
             separator is a caret [^] in 4DOS.  Use an ampersand [&] in
             4OS2 and 4DOS/NT.)  This command starts the timer, runs the
             TOUR2.BTM file to create the three demonstration files,
             deletes the three files, and then stops the timer and displays
             the time the whole operation took.  Enter this command to time
             the entire sequence on your computer:

                  c:\4dos> timer ^ tour2 ^ del file1 file2 file3 ^ timer
                  Timer 1 on: 11:10:01

                  Please wait ...

                  File creation completed
                  Deleting c:\4dos\file1
                  Deleting c:\4dos\file2
                  Deleting c:\4dos\file3
                       3 file(s) deleted
                  Timer 1 off: 11:10:06 elapsed: 0:00:05.11

             Now return to the log that you started a few minutes ago.
             Turn logging off, then take a look at what was recorded.
             Enter the following two commands:

                  c:\4dos> log off
                  c:\4dos> list mylog

             You'll see a full-screen display of the log file.  It should
             look something like this:

                  [11-03-93 11:05:02] cls bright white on magenta
                  [11-03-93 11:05:54] color bright yellow on blue
                  [11-03-93 11:07:08] free
                  [11-03-93 11:07:49] memory
                  [11-03-93 11:09:55] timer
                  [11-03-93 11:09:56] tour2
                    ... (commands from TOUR2.BTM will be displayed here)
                  [11-03-93 11:10:00] del file1 file2 file3
                  [11-03-93 11:10:01] timer
                  [11-03-93 11:12:35] log off

             You can scroll through the log with the arrow keys and PgUp /
             PgDn.  Press Esc to exit when you've finished viewing the log.

             As you can see, the log contains every command you entered
             plus a date and time stamp.  It's a complete record of system
             activity, including commands you type and those entered from
             batch files and aliases.  You can use it as a record of your
             work, for security purposes, or for anything else you desire.
             You may want to clean up the directory now by deleting this
             demonstration log with a DEL MYLOG command.


        Batch Programming

             This final section demonstrates a very few of the enhancements
             we offer for your batch files.  If you've never worked with
             batch files, you may want to skip this section.  If you aren't
             sure, give it a try and stop if things seem too complex.  You
             don't have to be a batch file expert to use 4DOS, 4OS2, or
             4DOS/NT.

             Rather than having you go to the trouble of writing actual
             batch files, we'll demonstrate some of the batch file features
             that work just as well at the prompt.

             Some batch file improvements aid in communicating with the
             user.  You can make sounds:

                  c:\4dos> beep 440 2 880 8 660 4

             You can draw boxes and lines.  Enter each of these commands on
             one line;  use the second set of commands if you have a
             monochrome monitor:

                  c:\4dos> cls bright white on blue
                  c:\4dos> drawbox 10 10 20 70 4 bright cyan on black
                             fill black
                  c:\4dos> drawhline 15 10 61 1 bright cyan on black

                  c:\4dos> cls bright white on black
                  c:\4dos> drawbox 10 10 20 70 4 black on white fill
                            white
                  c:\4dos> drawhline 15 10 61 1 black on white

             Notice that these commands correctly connect the lines on the
             screen where they intersect.  Additional commands like SCREEN
             and SCRPUT, which we won't demonstrate here, display text
             anywhere on the screen and in any color.

             You can also ask the user for input.  Try this (be sure to use
             two percent signs before the second "letter"):

                  c:\4dos> inkey Enter a letter: %%letter

        -------------------------------------------------------------------
        Copyright 1993, JP Software Inc.                                 21

                                   A Guided Tour Of 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4DOS/NT
        -------------------------------------------------------------------

                  Enter a letter: A

             The letter you typed was stored in your environment in the
             variable named LETTER.  Use the SET command to view it:

                  c:\4dos> set
                  COMSPEC=C:\4DOS\4DOS.COM
                       ... ... ...
                  LETTER=A

             The user can also type full strings if you use the INPUT
             command:

                  c:\4dos> input Enter a string: %%string
                  Enter a string: Type anything you like here ...

             Again, SET will let you view the string, stored in the
             environment variable STRING.

             Once you've collected some input, you will probably want to
             test it with the IF and IFF commands.  Here's one example.
             Enter this on one line (there's plenty of room;  command lines
             can be up to 255 characters long in 4DOS, and up to 1023
             characters in 4OS2 and 4DOS/NT).  Note that two percent signs
             are used in the INKEY command and one is used in the IFF, and
             that a double equal sign is used in the IFF statement.  Type
             ampersands [&] in place of the carets [^] if you are using
             4OS2 or 4DOS/NT.

                  c:\4dos> inkey Enter a letter: %%letter ^
                           iff "%letter"=="A" then ^ echo hi ^ else ^
                           echo bye ^ endiff

             Try using the up-arrow to repeat the command several times,
             giving different responses to the "Enter a letter" prompt.

             4DOS, 4OS2, and 4DOS/NT offer dozens of additional batch file
             improvements.  For more information see the Reference Manual.


        Conclusion

             This has been a very fast tour of some of the most popular
             features of our enhanced command processors.  There are many
             more features, commands, and options to explore, as well as
             ways to customize your system so that it suits your computing
             habits and needs.  One of the best features of 4DOS, 4OS2, and
             4DOS/NT is their ability to adapt to your way of working
             instead of requiring you to adapt to them.

             If you selected "Tour Installation" when you ran the INSTALL
             program, you will probably want to perform a full installation
             now.  You can put the distribution disk in your floppy drive,
             run INSTALL, and follow the instructions on the screen.  If
             you need help, refer to the installation instructions in your
             Introduction and Installation Guide.
