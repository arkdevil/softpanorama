   Greetings, and thanks for trying 4DOS!

   This file contains a variety of information you should read before using
   4DOS, including:

      * Changes in version 5.0          * Technical support
      * Files included with 4DOS        * Bulletin board support
      * Installation instructions       * Shareware and ASP policies
      * Upgrading from 4DOS 4.x

   If you have tried a shareware copy of 4DOS and want to place an order,
   or if you'd like to find out about our other products (including our
   enhanced command processors for OS/2 and Windows NT:  4OS2 and 4DOS/NT),
   see the product and ordering information in the file ORDERINF.DOC, or
   call us at (800) 368-8777 (USA only, orders only please!) or (617) 646-
   3975.  The order form is included separately in the file ORDER.FRM.

   For complete installation instructions, see page 4.  These instructions
   cover installation procedures for both new users and those upgrading
   from a previous version of 4DOS.  If you are upgrading a registered copy
   of 4DOS and you have the version 4.01 or 4.02 BRAND program, you MUST
   run BRAND5.EXE (included with this copy of 4DOS) to brand version 5.0. 
   See the upgrade instructions for further details.

   The license agreement which governs your use of 4DOS is included
   separately in the file LICENSE.DOC.  Please read it before ordering. 
   The text is written in plain English, and clearly explains your rights
   and responsibilities as a user of 4DOS.  For more information on the
   shareware system under which you obtained this copy of 4DOS, see page 7.

   This file, like all 4DOS ASCII documentation files, is formatted at 58
   lines per page, and contains form feeds and page footers.  It can be
   viewed with a file viewer such as the 4DOS LIST command, or printed on
   most PC printers using the command:

            copy readme.doc prn

   Printing it with a program that formats the pages is not likely to work
   due to the formatting included in the file.
                                                               (11/93-5.0A)

   Changes in Version 5.0

      Be sure to read the installation instructions in this file before
      installing 4DOS 5.0!

      Version 5.0 is a major new release of 4DOS.  It coincides with
      similar major releases of our other command processors:  4OS2 version
      2.0 and 4DOS for Windows NT version 2.0.

      If you are a current 4DOS user, be sure to check over the list of
      changes in this version, in the file UPDAT50.DOC, BEFORE you begin
      using version 5.0!  The list below gives only a very small sample of
      what's new in this version.  You may also want to look through
      APPNOTES.DOC for any new application notes (look for a "5.0" in the
      left margin).  If you're a new 4DOS user, you can skip UPDAT50.DOC.

      Major new features in this version include:

          "Ranges" allow you to select files for processing based on the
          date and / or time a file was last modified, or the file's size.

          4DOS now supports global alias and history lists, so that you can
          share aliases and / or the command history between multiple
          shells.  

          .BTM files can now be compressed, to make it easier for PC and
          network managers to distribute batch files whose contents cannot
          readily be altered by the end user.

          The maximum file description length has been increased to 200
          characters.

          You can select the colors used for command line input.

          There is a new popup directory history window which shows recent
          directories you've used.

          There is a new filename completion window which allows you to pop
          up a pick-list window of all the matching files, and insert a
          selected filename into the command line.

          DO is a new loop control command for batch files.  

          KEYBD is a new command to toggle the state of the Caps Lock, Num
          Lock, and Shift Lock keys.

          LIST has been completely rewritten and offers many new features.

          ON is a new error-handling command for batch files.

          There are dozens of new variables and variable functions for use
          in batch files and aliases.

          The help system has been extensively revised to offer more
          complete information and to make navigation easier.


   Files Included with 4DOS 5.0

      Please note that the way your copy of 4DOS is "packaged" will vary
      depending on the distribution method (5.25" disk, 3.5" disk, or on-
      line).  In general there will be two 5.25", 360K disks, or one 3.5"
      720K disk.  On-line copies will be in two .ZIP files, typically named
      4DOS5A.ZIP and 4DOS5B.ZIP, or 4DOS50A.ZIP and 4DOS50B.ZIP.

      In addition, you may choose to download the 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4DOS/NT
      Reference Manual (the file is named REFMAN.DOC, and is typically
      stored in the file JP4REF.ZIP).  This is a large file and much of the
      same information is available in the online help system, but we do
      make the ASCII version of the manual available for those who wish to
      download it.

      ZIP files distributed by JP Software will display the message
      "Authentic files Verified!   # VHJ325   JP Software Inc." when they
      are unzipped.  If you do not see this message, the ZIP file you are
      using has been modified.  This does not necessarily indicate a
      problem (for example, some BBS sysops "brand" 4DOS with their BBS
      name using software from us; 4DOS ZIP files on these BBSes will not
      show the JP Software verification message).  However it does alert
      you to the fact that the file has been changed since it was created
      by JP Software.

   Installation Instructions

      (These instructions do not cover diskette installation, because when
      4DOS is installed from diskette this file is not visible until after
      installation is complete.)

      Whether or not you presently have 4DOS installed, create a new
      directory for 4DOS 5.0 (do not install it in the same directory as a
      previous version of 4DOS).  Decompress your downloaded 4DOS 5.0 files
      into this directory.  You can print the 4DOS Introduction and
      Installation Guide, or any 4DOS documentation file (including this
      one), by copying it to the printer with the COPY command.

      Please note that the 4DOS Introduction and Installation Guide is
      about 80 pages long, and the Reference Manual is over 380 pages long! 
      If you don't want to print these files they can be viewed on-screen
      with a file viewer such as the 4DOS LIST command.  Most of what's in
      the Reference Manual is also available in the 4DOS help system.

      For a guided tour of 4DOS features see the instructions in TOUR.DOC. 
      To install 4DOS completely, follow the manual installation
      instructions in Chapter 1 of 4DOS.DOC, disregarding the discussion of
      extracting files from the diskettes.

      Be sure you have a bootable DOS floppy disk (as described at the
      beginning of Chapter 2) before installing 4DOS on your system.  This
      is not because 4DOS is likely to cause trouble.  It's because a
      mistake in the system startup files (CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT), or
      a power failure or other disturbance during installation, could
      prevent your system from booting properly.  While such problems are
      rare, any time you modify CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT you should have
      a bootable floppy disk handy so you can recover if necessary.

   Upgrading from 4DOS Version 4.0, 4.01, or 4.02 to Version 5.0

      Be sure to go over the changes in version 5.0, in the file
      UPDAT50.DOC, before you start using it.  4DOS 5.0 can be run in "test
      drive" mode over previous versions of 4DOS, so you can test the new
      version before fully installing it.  4DOS 5.0 should always be
      installed in a different directory (or if you have a floppy-disk
      system, on a different disk) than any earlier version of 4DOS.

          IMPORTANT NOTE:  If you purchased a registered copy of 4DOS 4.01
          or 4.02 and have downloaded 4DOS to upgrade to version 5.0, you
          MUST run the BRAND5 program, rather than your current BRAND
          program, to install your name and serial number into the new
          version.  If you do not, BRAND will not work on version 5.0. 
          This is due to a very minor bug in BRAND.

          BRAND5 modifies BRAND.EXE to correct this bug, then runs BRAND
          for you.  Therefore you should place BRAND5.EXE, your version
          4.01 or 4.02 BRAND.EXE, and your new version 5 4DOS.COM file in
          the same directory, and have your brand codes handy, before
          running BRAND5.

          Once you have used BRAND5 successfully the first time, your
          BRAND.EXE program will be patched and can then be used by itself,
          without BRAND5.

          This fix is not necessary for the version 4.0 BRAND program.  If
          you are unsure of which version of BRAND.EXE you have, go ahead
          and run BRAND5 -- it is well-behaved, and won't modify your copy
          of BRAND.EXE unless the modification is needed and can be
          performed correctly.  If your copy of BRAND.EXE doesn't need to
          be modified, or has already been modified, BRAND5 will leave it
          alone, but will go ahead and run it for you to complete the
          branding process.

          If you receive a "Brand installation error 6" when attempting to
          brand version 5.0, you probably have not run BRAND5, or BRAND5
          did not finish correctly.  If you receive ANY other branding
          error the problem lies elsewhere (for example, your eligibility
          for a downloadable major upgrade may have expired).

          If you have trouble with BRAND5, reinstall the original BRAND.EXE
          program from your 4DOS 4.x distribution disk, then run BRAND5
          again.  If you still have difficulty, contact JP Software for
          technical assistance.

      To upgrade from 4DOS 4.0, 4.01, or 4.02 to version 5.0, make the
      following changes in your system configuration:

          * Modify the SHELL= line in CONFIG.SYS to reflect the new
            directory where 4DOS.COM is stored.  Make a similar




   4DOS 5.0  [11-23-93]           README.DOC                         page 5


            modification to any SET COMSPEC statements you have in
            AUTOEXEC.BAT or other batch files.

          * Modify any line in AUTOEXEC.BAT which loads KSTACK.COM to
            reflect the new directory where KSTACK.COM is stored.

          * If you keep any 4DOS startup or exit files (4DOS.INI, 4START,
            or 4EXIT) in your 4DOS directory, be sure to move or copy the
            old files into the directory where 4DOS 5.0 is stored.  (If the
            files are in the root directory of the boot drive they do not
            need to be moved.)  Also be sure to modify any path information
            in these files to reflect the new directory for 4DOS (for
            example, if you have a HelpPath directive in 4DOS.INI you may
            need to change it to point to the new directory for the 4DOS
            5.0 copy of the 4HELP program).

          * If you use OS/2 2.x, be sure that any DOS_SHELL settings you
            have explicitly set to 4DOS in your DOS session objects are
            modified to reflect the new directory where 4DOS.COM is stored. 
            You can also highlight the DOS_SHELL setting and click on the
            Default button; this will set the command processor for the
            object to whatever is specified on the SHELL= line in
            CONFIG.SYS.  See your 4DOS Introduction and Installation Guide
            for complete details on using 4DOS with OS/2.

          * Obtain a copy of the BRAND program which came with your
            registered copy of 4DOS version 4, put it in the same directory
            as the 4DOS version 5 files, and run it with the command BRAND. 
            (If you have the version 4.01 or 4.02 BRAND program you must
            run BRAND5 instead; see above for details.)  Follow the on-
            screen instructions to install your name and serial number into
            4DOS.  The information needed to BRAND your copy is on the
            small blue or yellow "Brand ID Card" which came with your copy
            of 4DOS.  If you cannot find this card with your branding
            codes, you can order a replacement from JP Software for $5.

      Once you've made these changes, you can reboot your system and you'll
      be running 4DOS 5.0.


   Technical Support

      We support 4DOS in our own CompuServe area, section 10 of the PC
      Vendor B forum (GO PCVENB).  If you are not currently a CompuServe
      subscriber, consider a special offer CompuServe has made to 4DOS
      users:  call 1-800-848-8199 (outside the US and Canada call 614-457-
      0802) and ask for operator 178 to receive a free CompuServe
      introductory membership, including user ID, password, and a $15
      connect time credit.

      For technical support on the Internet send mail to
      75300.1215@compuserve.com.

      Support is also available by phone (617-646-3975), fax (617-646-
      0904), and mail (JP Software, PO Box 1470, E. Arlington, MA 02174). 
      Telephone support hours and availability may vary depending on our
      current staffing pattern and workload; there may not always be a
      support representative available when you call, in which case we will
      take a message and call you back.  We return calls as soon as
      possible, and our normal policy is to return all calls within at most
      24 hours (weekends and holidays excluded).


   Bulletin Board Support for 4DOS

      4DOS product support is always available on our support BBS, Channel
      1 in Boston.  Channel 1 is an independent BBS (not operated by JP
      Software) which has generously offered to provide a home for 4DOS BBS
      support.  Phone 617-354-5776 to access Channel 1 at 2400 - 14,400
      baud (no parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit).

      If you have access to a local bulletin board which is a member of any
      of the major BBS networks (RIME / PC Relay, ILink, SmartNet, or
      FidoNet), you can discuss 4DOS with other users, and obtain limited
      support from JP Software, by leaving messages in the network's 4DOS
      conference.


   Shareware Copies of 4DOS

      If you obtained 4DOS from a shareware disk vendor, an on-line
      computer service or bulletin board, a friend or colleague, or another
      similar source, you have an unregistered (trial) copy.  As the
      copyright holder for this software, JP Software allows and encourages
      you to use this trial copy without charge for a limited period of
      time, under the terms of our license agreement (see LICENSE.DOC). 
      After this time is up, you must purchase (register and pay for) the
      product to continue using it.

      This method of distribution is known as shareware.  It allows you to
      determine whether the product meets your needs before you pay for it.

      Payment of the shareware registration fee for 4DOS entitles you to a
      complete copy of the product with typeset-quality printed and bound
      manuals; the ability to download an upgrade to the next major release
      of the product; continued technical support via electronic mail or
      telephone; and a subscription to "The Prompt Solution", JP Software's
      customer newsletter.


   Association of Shareware Professionals

      The authors and publisher of 4DOS are members of the Association of
      Shareware Professionals (ASP), an organization formed to strengthen
      the future of shareware.  Its members, all of whom are programmers

      who subscribe to a code of ethics, are committed to the concept of
      shareware as a method of marketing.

      The ASP sets standards for its members and their shareware products
      which provide that programs produced by ASP members must be fully
      documented, non-crippled, and offered with at least a minimum level
      of support.  It also sets standards for shareware disk vendors and
      provides information to the public about shareware.


   ASP Ombudsman Statement

      JP Software is a member of the Association of Shareware Professionals
      (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure that the shareware principle works for
      you. If you are unable to resolve a shareware-related problem with an
      ASP member by contacting the member directly, ASP may be able to
      help. The ASP Ombudsman can help you resolve a dispute or problem
      with an ASP member, but does not provide technical support for
      members' products.  Please write to the ASP Ombudsman at 545 Grover
      Road, Muskegon, MI 49442 or send a CompuServe message via CompuServe
      Mail to ASP Ombudsman 70007,3536.
