   This file contains important information you should read before ordering
   (page 2), and details on all products sold by JP Software (page 7).  To
   save paper and time, our order form is included separately in the file
   ORDER.FRM.  This allows you to view the information in this file on the
   screen if you wish, and print only the actual order form.

   Please read the order information section on page 2 before placing your
   order!  That section explains our order and payment policies.  If you
   don't read over the policies before ordering you may make errors which
   delay your order and result in additional costs to you.

   The license agreement which governs your use of our products is included
   separately in the file LICENSE.DOC (for downloaded copies), or on your
   diskette envelope (for purchased copies).  Please read it before
   ordering.  It is written in plain English, and explains your rights and
   responsibilities as a user of 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4DOS for Windows NT.

   If you live outside the U.S. and Canada you may want to check the list
   of international dealers in this file.  These dealers can often provide
   local service, and may offer faster shipping than we can provide when
   mailing packages from the United States.

   This file is formatted at 58 lines per page, and contains form feeds and
   page footers.  It can be viewed with a file viewer such as the 4DOS or
   4OS2 internal LIST command, or printed using the command:

            copy orderinf.doc prn

   Printing it with a program that formats the pages is not likely to work
   due to the formatting included in the file.

      to ensure delivery within 3 days of shipment.  Where appropriate, or
      when requested, we will ship via U.S. Priority or First Class Mail. 
      Shipping outside the U.S. is via TNT Mailfast or Air Mail.  The

      delivery time for all countries outside the U.S. is generally 1-2
      weeks.  All delivery times may vary during peak upgrade periods.


   Shipping Charges:

      To the U.S. and Canada:  $6 for first item, $1 for each additional
      item.  COD (USA only), add $6 for entire order

      To all other countries:  $12 for the first item, $3 for each
      additional item.

      If your order includes ONLY disks (e.g. disk only upgrades or utility
      disks), and no manuals, you are entitled to reduced shipping:  To the
      U.S. and Canada, $2 for the first item and $1 for each additional
      item; to all other countries, $4 for the first item and $3 for each
      additional item.


   Payment Terms:

      We accept Mastercard, Visa, American Express, checks (MUST be drawn
      on a US bank, and in US funds), money orders, purchase orders (see
      below for policies), and COD shipments. 
     
      We are happy to accept purchase orders from established U.S.
      companies and government agencies.  Our terms are net 30 days. 
      Orders under $100   ($200 for international companies) must be

      previously ordered from us on terms.
     

   4DOS / 4OS2 / 4DOS for Windows NT Upgrade Policy:

      The upgrade policies listed here apply to the U.S. versions of 4DOS,
      4OS2, and 4DOS for Windows NT as purchased from JP Software.  Dealers
      outside the U.S. may establish different upgrade policies, check with
      your dealer for details.  Our products use three-digit version
      numbers (e.g. 5.01).  Maintenance releases are indicated by a change
      in the last digit (e.g. 5.02, 5.03); major upgrades are indicated by
      a change in the other digits (e.g. 5.1, 6.0).

      You can always purchase both maintenance releases and major upgrades
      from JP Software.  In addition, when you purchase a single copy of
      4DOS, 4OS2, or 4DOS for Windows NT, or a multi-system license for any
      of our products, maintenance releases and the next major release
      issued after your purchase are downloadable from a variety of
      sources.  You can then convert the downloaded copy to a fully
      registered copy using the BRAND program included in your original
      package.  Additional major upgrades beyond the first will be
      available at a reasonable cost from JP Software.

   Multi-System Licenses:

      Whether you are a major corporation, a small business, or an
      individual with more than one computer, if you plan to use our
      products on multiple systems you can save money by ordering a multi-
      system license rather than individual copies.  (If all you want to do
      is use 4DOS, 4OS2, or 4DOS for Windows NT at work and at home you may
      not need a second copy; see the license agreement in the LICENSE.DOC
      file for details.)

      A multi-system license includes a master diskette and one manual. 
      Additional manuals are $12 each (less for large quantities).  Multi-
      system licenses may be used at any number of physical sites, and on
      networked or stand-alone systems, as long as all support and
      distribution are handled through a single location.  JP Software also
      offers a simple policy which allows you to increase your license size
      at a reasonable price as you add new systems.

      Our pricing structure covers any number of systems and goes well
      beyond what is listed below; you pay only for the number of systems
      actually using the product.  For larger licenses, a variety of custom
      arrangements can be made to meet your specific needs.  A signed
      license agreement is required when licensing 100 or more systems.

      Please contact us if you need more information on 4DOS, 4OS2 or 4DOS
      for Windows NT licenses, including prices not shown in the table
      below, or multi-system license information on BOOT.SYS.

   Product Information
   -------------------

      This section describes each of JP Software's products, so you know
      what you're getting before you order.  We are excited to be able to
      offer you some new products, including 4DOS for Windows NT to replace
      the Windows NT command processor, BOOT.SYS for selecting system
      configuration at boot time, and Personnal REXX for DOS and OS/2 to
      make your batch programming easy and efficient.

      4DOS, 4OS2, and 4DOS for Windows NT:

          4DOS is our "flagship" product.  It is a DOS enhancement utility
          designed to add power, elegance, and flexibility to the DOS
          prompt.  4DOS is a complete replacement for COMMAND.COM, the
          command processor which displays the "C:\> prompt and accepts and
          executes the commands you type.  It offers dozens of features
          beyond those available with DOS alone.  If you aren't familiar
          with what 4DOS is and what it does, take a look at the manual for
          all the details.  It offers you great power while working at the
          DOS prompt and in batch files, makes minimal use of your precious
          memory, and generally makes life with DOS a whole lot easier.  It
          works with all versions of MS-DOS / PC-DOS from 2.0 up, and with
          DR DOS / Novell DOS.

          4OS2 is to OS/2 what 4DOS is to DOS.  It is a complete
          replacement for CMD.EXE, the default OS/2 command processor, and
          brings the full power of 4DOS to OS/2 users.  4OS2 offers all of
          the features of 4DOS, plus additional features designed to
          enhance command processing under OS/2.  When you purchase 4OS2
          you will receive both the 16-bit and 32-bit versions, and you can
          install the version appropriate to your copy of OS/2.  Using 4OS2
          with 4DOS provides a consistent interface in OS/2 character-mode
          sessions and the DOS compatibility box (OS/2 1.x) (or DOS
          machines in OS/2 2.0).  4OS2 is compatible with OS/2 1.2, 1.3,
          2.0, and 2.1.

          4DOS and 4OS2 are $69 each including disk, manual, and a free or
          low-cost upgrade to the next major release (see page 3 for
          details on upgrades).  If you need both products, purchase them
          together for just $89.  If you have one product and want the
          other, the cost is just $29.  Multi-system licenses are also
          available (see page 4).

          JP Software's latest product is 4DOS for Windows NT ("4DOS/NT"). 
          4DOS/NT is a complete replacement for CMD.EXE, the default
          Windows NT command processor, and brings the full power of 4DOS
          to Windows NT users.  4DOS/NT also offers additional features
          designed to enhance command processing under Windows NT with its
          Single Command Shell architecture.  4DOS for Windows NT is $79
          alone, or $99 when bundled with 4DOS.  4DOS/NT for registered
          4DOS users is $39.

      4DOS / 4OS2 Utility Disks:

          JP Software offers Utility Disks for registered users only. 
          These disks contain the files needed to modify the help text, and
          4DOS and 4OS2 utility disk contains other useful utilities (see
          below). The Utility disks are $10 each.

          The 4DOS Utility Disk contains the JP Software's 4DOS help text
          and help compiler (4MAKE).  4MAKE is a licensed product offered
          by JP Software, and is available only by purchasing the 4DOS
          Utility Disk.  It allows you to add, modify, or delete
          information in the 4DOS HELP system.  You can use the modified
          help text yourself, and distribute it to other registered 4DOS
          users within your company or organization, but you cannot sell it
          or distribute it publicly.

          Other products on the 4DOS Utility Disk are either shareware or
          freeware, and are available on many BBSes and on-line services. 
          We provide these products on the Utility Disk as a service to
          those customers who do not have modems or who prefer to obtain
          software on diskette.  Like all shareware, you must register any
          of the shareware products that you continue to use after a trial
          period.  The shareware and freeware products on the 4DOS Utility
          Disk are:

            *  TSRCOM, TurboPower Software's popular freeware package of
               TSR and memory management and mapping utilities.

            *  A shareware copy of BOOT.SYS, which allows you to select
               your system configuration at boot time.  See page 10 for
               details on this product.

            *  A shareware copy of 4EDIT, a full-screen 4DOS file
               description editor.

            *  A shareware copy of 4FILES, another full-screen 4DOS file
               description editor.

            *  A shareware copy of SWAPDOS, a utility to swap applications
               out of memory when you shell to DOS.

          The 4OS2 Utility Disk contains the text for the 4OS2 help system
          and for 4OS2's "quick help" (messages displayed with the "/?"
          switch on 4OS2 commands).  You can modify this text and recompile
          it for your own use or for use by registered 4OS2 users within
          your organization.  To recompile the help text you must have
          access to the IBM Information Presentation Facility Compiler
          (IPFC) which is used by developers to develop help for OS/2
          programs.  IPFC is distributed by IBM as part of its developer's
          toolkit for OS/2.  To recompile the quick help text you must have

          access to the MKMSGF program, which is also part of the OS/2
          developer's toolkit.

          The 4OS2 Utility Disk also contains some additional shareware or
          freeware utilities which we feel 4OS2 users might find useful:

            *  A shareware copy of Browse/2, a Presentation Manager
               application for browsing ASCII files.

            *  A shareware copy of the OS/2 version of Vern Buerg's popular
               LIST utility.  Runs in character mode.

            *  MEMSIZE, a freeware system resource monitor.  Displays swap
               file size and available space, CPU load, and free disk
               space.  Runs under Presentation Manager.

            *  SHOWINI, a freeware REXX script to display the contents of
               OS/2 .INI files.


      4DOS for Windows NT Utility Disk:

          JP Software also offers a Utility Disk for registered 4DOS for
          WIndows NT users.  This disk contains the 4DOS for Windows NT
          help text, in both Word for Windows and RTF formats.  At this
          time it does not contain any other utilities.

          In order to use the 4DOS for Windows NT help text, you must have
          a word processor which can handle the Word for Windows and / or
          RTF formats, and a Windows help compiler such as Microsoft's HC31
          (distributed with the Windows and Windows NT Software Development
          Kits).

          You can modify the help text for your own use or for use by other
          registered 4DOS for Windows NT users within your company or
          organization, but you cannot sell it or distribute it publicly.

          To order your copy, contact Computer Solutions (see page 5).  The
          German version of 4DOS is available only from Computer Solutions,
          not from JP Software.


      BOOT.SYS:

          BOOT.SYS is a shareware package which allows you to choose your
          system configuration when your computer boots.  It makes managing
          a variety of configurations (for example, booting under plain
          4DOS, DESQView, or Windows 3) very simple.  It supports multi-
          level menus, color display, and option selection in both
          CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT.  It is invoked when the system
          boots, and does not require a reboot after changing
          configurations the way some similar programs do.  We use BOOT.SYS
          here at JP Software, and we like it so much we decided to add it
          to our product line.  BOOT.SYS is fully compatible with MS-DOS
          and PC-DOS version 6 and below, and with DR DOS.

          To use BOOT.SYS effectively you need to be reasonably familiar
          with CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  BOOT.SYS works with
          multiple sets of configuration directives (DEVICE, SHELL, etc.)
          in your CONFIG.SYS file.  It presents menus to allow you to
          choose which set or subset of these directives to execute, and
          also provides a program you can run in AUTOEXEC to determine
          which menu choice was selected.  You use the result returned by
          this program in IF or IFF statements in AUTOEXEC.BAT in order to
          make AUTOEXEC execute the correct TSRs and other commands
          corresponding to the choices you made in CONFIG.SYS.  This
          approach is very powerful when combined with 4DOS IFF / THEN /
          ELSE statements.

          A shareware copy of BOOT.SYS is available on the 4DOS utility
          disk, and can be downloaded from our CompuServe support area and
          many other on-line services and local BBSes.  You can order your
          registered copy of BOOT.SYS from JP Software for $42.


      Shareware Plus:  Featuring 4DOS (book):

          This 280-page book, published by Business One Irwin, is the first
          independently published book about 4DOS.  The author, David
          Busch, is an accomplished computer book author and the first two-
          time winner of "Best Book" honors from the Computer Press
          Association.

          The book takes you through a wide range of 4DOS features, and
          includes sample batch files and aliases on disk.  If you'd like a
          basic introduction to 4DOS and a set of examples you can work
          from, or you want a more step by step approach to 4DOS features,
          then this book is for you.

      Personal REXX:

          Personal REXX is a powerful, easy-to-use language from Quercus
          Systems that offers a perfect complement to 4DOS and 4OS2 batch
          commands. The REXX language is more powerful than traditional
          batch languages, without the heavy technical baggage of a
          conventional programming language.  It was specifically designed
          to be easy to read and write, so you can get started quickly and
          get your work done efficiently.  If you need advanced string
          processing capabilities, or are stretching the limits of the 4DOS
          and 4OS2 batch languages, then Personal REXX is for you!

          We are now running a special offer on both Personal REXX for DOS
          and Personal REXX for OS/2 & DOS. You can purchase the DOS
          version for $89 and the OS/2 & DOS versions both for $99.  THIS
          OFFER EXPIRES JANUARY 15, 1994!!  After January 15, we will
          continue to offer Personal REXX but at regular prices:  $129
          (DOS) and $149 (OS/2 and DOS).


      QEdit:

          QEdit is a fast, easy-to-use, full-featured text editor
          for batch files, simple documents, and program code. It's
          perfect for creating configuration files, or for any task
          that requires a small, yet powerful, ASCII text editor.
          QEdit offers multiple files and windows, pull-down menus,
          macros, and line, character, and column block operations.
          You can configure the keyboard as you like it and even
          spell check your files.  We use QEdit here at JP Software,
          and decided you might like it too!
