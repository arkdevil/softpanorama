                          AND LIMITED WARRANTY

   (1) Introduction.  This agreement explains when and how you may use both
   shareware and registered copies of software products from JP Software.
   In this agreement:

      *  "Program" means the JP Software software products(s) you have
         purchased or obtained for evaluation, including both the software
         and the associated documentation and other materials;

      *  "Shareware Copy" means a copy of the Program distributed by us or
         by our authorized agents for evaluation purposes and which is
         described as a shareware copy in the Program's sign-on messages;

      *  "Registered Copy" means a copy of the Program purchased from us or
         from a dealer, and which is not described as a shareware copy in
         the Program's sign-on messages;

      *  "we" or "us" means JP Software Inc., a corporation based in
         Arlington, Massachusetts, USA; and

      *  "you" means the end user of the Program.

   (2) Legal Agreement.  This is a legal agreement which allows you, the end
   user, to use the Program under certain terms and conditions.  If you
   cannot agree to abide by what this agreement says you should not use or
   evaluate the Program.

   (3) Copyright.  The Program is fully protected by copyright under U.S.
   law and international treaty provisions.

   (4) Evaluation Period.  You may use a Shareware Copy of the Program for
   an evaluation period of up to 21 days, in order to determine whether the
   program meets your needs before purchasing it.  Once the evaluation
   period ends, you agree to either purchase a Registered Copy of the
   Program, or to stop using it.  If you have ordered a Registered Copy of
   the Program from us or from a dealer, you may continue to use your
   Shareware Copy until your Registered Copy arrives.

   (5) Use of the Program.  While you are evaluating the Program, you may
   use it on as many computers as are required to perform your evaluation.
   Your 21-day evaluation period begins when you first install the Program
   on one or more computers for evaluation purposes. Once the evaluation
   period is over and you purchase the program, your use is subject to the
   following restrictions:

      (A) You agree not to install or use any individual copy of the Program
      on more than one computer at a time. However, you may install an
      individual copy simultaneously on one computer at work, one computer
      at home, and one portable computer, if all these computers are used
      primarily by the same individual, and there is no possibility that the

      computers will be in use at the same time except while you are
      actively transferring files between them. (If the Program was
      purchased by your employer you agree to get your employer's explicit
      permission before installing the Program on multiple computers as
      described above.)

      (B) If you purchased a multi-system license for the Program you agree
      not to install or use it on more computers than the number included in
      your license, as shown on your invoice, the program sign-on screen, or
      other documents from us.

   (6) Making and Distributing Shareware Copies of the Program.  You may
   make copies of your Shareware Copy of the Program to give to others, as
   long as you include all of the files that you originally received with
   your Shareware Copy.  When you give a Shareware Copy of the Program to
   another person, you agree to inform them that their copy is to be used
   for a time limited evaluation period, and that they must purchase a
   Registered Copy if they continue to use the Program once the evaluation
   period has ended.  You agree not to sell Shareware Copies of the Program
   or distribute them to others for any kind of compensation or fee unless
   you abide by the restrictions in JP Software's VENDOR.DOC file.

   (7) Copying Registered Copies of the Program.  When you receive a
   Registered Copy of the Program you may make copies of the Program
   software which are necessary for normal backup purposes. You agree not to
   make any other copies of the software, the manual(s), or any part of
   them, or sell or give any copies to others, without our advance written
   permission.

   (8)  Operation of the Program.  The Program offers powerful capabilities.
   If you do not follow our instructions, or if you use the Program
   improperly, you can destroy files or cause other damage to your software
   and data.  You assume full responsibility for the selection and use of
   the Program to achieve your intended results.

   (9) LIMITED WARRANTY:  The following limited warranty applies to
   Registered Copies of the Program.  It is included here so you understand
   what your warranty will be when you purchase a Registered Copy.  This
   warranty does NOT apply to Shareware Copies of the Program.

      Physical Defects.  We pledge that the disks and manuals we send you
      will arrive free of physical defects which interfere with normal use.
      If you find such a defect and report it to us within 90 days after you
      purchase the Program, we agree to replace the defective item(s) at no
      charge to you as long as the defect was not caused by misuse or abuse.

      Bugs and Program Errors.  We don't promise that the Program will be
      free of bugs or program errors.  If you report a program error or bug
      to us, we will use our best efforts to correct it.  If we issue a
      maintenance release for the Program which includes a correction for an
      error you reported, we will send you a copy of that maintenance
      release at no charge if you request it.  We will only do this for

      maintenance releases, not for new major releases or other new versions
      of the Program.

      Satisfaction Guarantee.  If you are dissatisfied with any product you
      buy from us under this Agreement for any reason, you may return it at
      any time up to 90 days after purchase and we will give you a refund.
      If the product is a JP Software product we will give you a full
      refund. If it is not a JP Software product we will give you a full
      refund if in our judgment the product is returned in resellable
      condition, or a 50% refund if not.  Refunds will be based on the price
      you paid, less shipping costs.  You must contact us before returning
      any product for a refund.  This satisfaction guarantee does not apply
      to multi- system licenses for more than 10 computers, or to purchases
      of more than 10 individual copies at one time.

   (10) DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS.  And now the legal language we couldn't
   avoid:

      DISCLAIMER FOR SHAREWARE COPIES:  YOU ARE NOT PAYING FOR THE TRIAL USE
      LICENSE FOR YOUR SHAREWARE COPY OF THE PROGRAM.  ACCORDINGLY THE
      SHAREWARE COPY IS PROVIDED "AS-IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

      DISCLAIMER FOR REGISTERED COPIES:  EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY
      STATED ABOVE, WE DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
      IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
      MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE LIMITED
      WARRANTY ABOVE GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, BUT YOU MAY HAVE OTHER
      RIGHTS, WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.

      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:  IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY
      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT
      OF USE OF THE PROGRAM OR YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US. SOME STATES DO NOT
      ALLOW EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR
      CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, THEREFORE THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO
      YOU.
