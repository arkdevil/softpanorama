This file provides information for bulletin board sysops on the distri-
bution of 4DOS via BBS systems.

We do explicitly permit uploads of the shareware version of 4DOS to BBS
systems.  (Obviously uploads of the registered version are not permit-
ted).  If you have any question as to whether the version which has been
uploaded to your BBS is shareware, simply uncompress the 4DOS.COM file
and run it.  The signon message will tell you which version you have,
and the serial number.  (When done, an EXIT command will return you to
COMMAND.COM).

If your BBS is associated with a shareware library which distributes
disks for a fee, you must meet our requirements BEFORE placing 4DOS in
the library.  See the file VENDOR.DOC for details.  This restriction
does not affect your permission to place 4DOS on the BBS as long as you
are not charging a fee for its distribution (other than the usual user
fees for general use of the board).

If you want software which will allow you to "brand" 4DOS for your BBS
(when the user starts the program it will say "uploaded to [your BBS
name]" in the signon message), send us a note and we will send it to
you, along with a 4DOS ZIP file designed for BBS upload.  Your copy will
be supplied on 3.5" disks.
