   This file provides information on using 4DOS with a variety of other
   software products.  It is intended for use whenever you have a question
   about using another product with 4DOS, or suspect a compatibility
   problem.

   Virtually all of your software will work with 4DOS with no trouble. 
   Inclusion of a product in this file does NOT mean there are
   compatibility problems with it!  It only indicates that we have some
   information that may be useful to you when you use the product with
   4DOS.

   Items in this file which were changed in 4DOS 5.0 are marked with "5.0"
   in the left margin.

   This file is formatted at 58 lines per page, and contains form feeds and
   page footers.  It is somewhat long, so you may prefer to view it with a
   file viewer such as the 4DOS LIST command.  You can print this file on
   most PC printers using the command:

              copy appnotes.doc prn

   Printing it with a program that formats the pages is not likely to work
   due to the formatting included in the file.

   Introduction
   ------------

   We have made every effort to ensure that this file is as accurate and up
   to date as possible.  Our information is based on our own
   investigations, reports from 4DOS beta testers, technical support calls,
   discussions with manufacturers of other products, and reports from our
   customers.  Unfortunately, varying conditions between systems or between
   software releases can easily invalidate the results of previous tests. 
   Therefore we cannot guarantee that every item in this file is accurate
   for all systems or will remain accurate over time; you may have to do
   your own testing to determine what works well on your system with the
   software you own.

   If you have a question or problem related to another program, first read
   through Chapter 3 and Appendix A of the 4DOS Introduction and
   Installation Guide ("4DOS And Your Hardware And Software").  Those
   sections of the manual give general suggestions for using 4DOS with
   other products and for solving compatibility problems, and should always
   be used along with this file.

   If the techniques in the manual don't help, check below for both
   additional general suggestions which pertain to your question, and
   information on the specific product you are working with.  Please note
   that some products are listed by category rather than or in addition to
   specific listings by product name; check the Table of Contents carefully
   to see where any particular product may be covered.

   Many of the items below refer to the 4DOS.INI file.  See Chapter 5 of
   the Reference Manual, or the online help, for a complete explanation of
   4DOS.INI and the directives which can be used there.

   Many popular software products are not covered in this file.  If a
   program does not appear here, it simply means that as far as we know no
   additional information is necessary or useful when using that program
   with 4DOS.

   If you have a question or problem related to how 4DOS works with other
   hardware or software products, and it isn't addressed in the manuals or
   these notes, contact JP Software or your dealer for technical support.

   General Information
   -------------------

      Running 4DOS along with COMMAND.COM:

          You may find a very rare program which will not work under 4DOS,
          but runs properly under COMMAND.COM.  If you have determined that
          the problem cannot be solved through configuration changes or by
          eliminating or reconfiguring a third program which is causing the
          problem, use this section to see how to run 4DOS and COMMAND.COM
          together in order to diagnose such a problem.

          There are two methods of loading COMMAND.COM before another
          program.  The first is to load it only when a specific program is
          running.  This can be accomplished with the following command
          (assuming COMMAND.COM is in the root directory of drive C:):

                    c:\command /c progname options

          where "progname" is the program name (with path if necessary) and
          "options" are any parameters for the program.  This command will
          run COMMAND.COM, load and run the program, and upon exit from the
          program will exit from COMMAND.COM and return to 4DOS.  If this
          is necessary to run a specific program, it can be defined as an
          alias:

                    alias progname `c:\command /c progname %&`

          The "%&" passes all command line arguments on to the program.

          With this method, if the program is large COMMAND.COM may need to
          reload itself when the program exits.  It will not be able to do
          so unless the COMSPEC is set properly.  If you experience
          problems such as "Invalid COMMAND.COM" errors when using this
          method, use a batch file like the following to run the program in
          question (the SETLOCAL and ENDLOCAL cause COMSPEC to be restored
          to its previous value after the program exits).  You will need to
          modify this file if your copy of COMMAND.COM is not stored in the
          C:\ directory:

                    setlocal
                    set comspec=C:\COMMAND.COM
                    c:\command /c progname %&
                    endlocal

          The second method is more drastic:  you can start your system
          under COMMAND.COM, then run 4DOS.  This approach is rarely
          necessary, and will use about 4 - 5K of additional RAM for the
          resident portion of COMMAND.COM.  





   4DOS 5.0  [11-23-93]          APPNOTES.DOC                        page 5


          The following steps will set your system up to boot with
          COMMAND.COM, and run 4DOS automatically as part of the boot
          process:

              (1) Set up the SHELL= statement in CONFIG.SYS to run
              COMMAND.COM, or leave it out entirely.  In other words, set
              it up just as you would if 4DOS were not on your system.

              (2) Separate your AUTOEXEC file into two parts:  part 1,
              which remains in AUTOEXEC.BAT, should contain any commands
              you wish to have COMMAND.COM execute before 4DOS is started. 
              This might include loading any TSRs which you cannot get to
              load properly under 4DOS.  Part 2, which you must place in a
              separate batch file (we suggest the name 4DAUTO.BAT, but you
              can use any name you wish), should contain the commands you
              wish to have 4DOS execute when it is started.

              (3) Place the following line as the last line in the modified
              AUTOEXEC.BAT:

                    4DOS parameters filename

              where "parameters" represents any necessary 4DOS parameters
              for your INI file name, et.c (see the manuals or the Startup
              topic in the online help for additional details), and
              "filename" is the name of the new batch file you created for
              part 2 of your old AUTOEXEC file.  Do NOT include a /P in the
              "parameters" or 4DOS will re-run AUTOEXEC and therefore load
              itself again, ad infinitum!

              (4) Be sure that KSTACK.COM is loaded in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
              file or your 4DOS startup file if you wish to use the 4DOS
              KEYSTACK command.

          This will load COMMAND.COM, execute the commands in AUTOEXEC,
          load 4DOS, execute the commands in your new batch file, and then
          give you the normal 4DOS prompt.

          There is one drawback to this second approach:  because 4DOS is
          not loaded with a /P, the EXIT command will return you to
          COMMAND.COM if you inadvertently enter it at the primary shell
          prompt.  You can get around this by including the /P parameter
          despite the caution above, and then placing the following line at
          the start of AUTOEXEC.BAT:

                    if "%@eval[2+2]"=="4" quit

          This line tests the 4DOS variable function %@EVAL, which will
          return "4" under 4DOS and remain unchanged under COMMAND.COM.  If
          %@EVAL returns a "4" the statement QUITs the batch file,
          preventing the infinite loop described above.

      Executing DOS Commands from Your Applications:

          In general you should have no trouble running DOS commands or
          "shelling to DOS" from within your applications.  If you do,
          first check your COMSPEC setting (see the Reference Manual or
          online help for details), and check that enough memory is
          available for 4DOS to execute as a secondary shell.

          If those techniques do not resolve the problem, it may be due to
          one of the issues covered below:  either the application was
          developed with a compiler that does not handle the format of
          4DOS.COM properly, or it is using interrupt 2E and you have
          disabled interrupt 2E support.

          Compilers and the Format of 4DOS.COM:

              If you have an application which can run DOS commands from
              inside the application and that particular feature does not
              work, try to determine if the application was developed with
              Borland C or Lattice C.  Some older versions of these
              compilers cannot properly execute 4DOS.COM to start a
              secondary shell, because 4DOS.COM (despite its name) is
              formatted as an EXE file, and the libraries shipped with
              these compilers do not use the proper method to determine
              what type of file they are running.

              If you suspect such a problem, make a copy of 4DOS.COM named
              4DOS.EXE, and SET your COMSPEC variable to this file, for
              example:

                    d:\4dos> copy 4dos.com 4dos.exe
                    d:\4dos> set comspec=d:\4dos\4dos.exe

              Then run the application in question and see if it works.  If
              so, you can use the above workaround to run the application. 
              Be sure to contact the application vendor to see if they have
              an update which corrects this problem.

          Re-Enabling Interrupt 2E Support:

              COMMAND.COM contains an undocumented feature which allows
              programs to execute DOS commands by passing the command
              through software interrupt number 2E (hex).  Very few
              programs use this feature, but full, documented support for
              it is available within 4DOS for those circumstances where
              it's needed.

              Interrupt 2E support is normally enabled within 4DOS, but can
              be disabled to save memory (INT 2E support requires about 100
              bytes of resident memory).

              If you have a program which is supposed to execute DOS
              commands and it does not work under 4DOS, check your 4DOS.INI
              file.  If you see a line like this:

                    FullINT2E = No

              then you have disabled INT 2E support.  If the line is there,
              try removing this line or replacing it with one reading:

                    FullINT2E = Yes

              to re-enable support for interrupt 2E, then check whether
              your program works properly.

              See Appendix x of the 4DOS Introduction and Installation
              Guide for technical details on the INT 2E interface.


      Swapping to RAM Disks:

          In order to swap the primary shell to a RAM disk the RAM disk
          must be completely defined in CONFIG.SYS via a DEVICE= statement
          (most RAM disks are set up this way).  RAM disks completely or
          partially defined in AUTOEXEC.BAT (such as the RAM disk / cache
          combination in Multisoft's PC Kwik Power Pak) cannot be used for
          swapping the primary shell, because AUTOEXEC.BAT has not been
          executed at the time that the root shell is loaded, and hence the
          RAM disk does not exist at that point.


      4DOS and Other Command Line Editing Programs:

          Programs such as Anarkey (Moderne Software), PCED (Cove
          Software), and ReDOS (Multisoft) will work properly with 4DOS. 
          However these programs require the use of SETDOS /L1 to operate,
          which will disable 4DOS's command recall and command line
          editing.  In most cases you will be able to switch back and forth
          between 4DOS editing and the other editor by toggling the SETDOS
          /L state.

          When another editor is used 4DOS's command history will be
          maintained, and can be viewed with HISTORY, but will not be
          available for recall until a SETDOS /L0 is executed.  4DOS
          aliases, executable extensions, and other features will be active
          regardless of the SETDOS /L state.  Aliases will be processed
          after any processing done by the other editing program.  You must
          use care with other programs that provide an aliasing capability
          to avoid confusion if a command is expanded by both the other
          program and 4DOS!

      4DOS and EXE File Compression Programs:

          If you use a file compression program like PKLITE, LZEXE, or
          DIET, you must use caution when compressing 4DOS files.  Most
          such programs should be able to compress the 4DOS.COM file with
          no trouble.  However if you have a copy of 4DOS that you intend
          to brand with your name and serial number, you must brand it
          BEFORE you run the file compression program, or the BRAND program
          will fail.  Similarly, HELPCFG will not be able to modify your
          HELP system colors if you compress the 4HELP.EXE program.  


      Mouse Compatibility with 4DOS HELP:

          The 4DOS HELP system depends on correct operation of your mouse
          driver.  If your mouse doesn't work in HELP, or you have trouble
          with mouse "droppings" (characters left behind by the mouse
          cursor), be sure you have the most up to date working version of
          your mouse driver that is available.

          Users of Microsoft serial and PS/2 mice may notice a long delay
          when the HELP system starts.  This is due to the long
          initialization time required for these mice, and is a function of
          the mouse driver, not the HELP system.  If you don't use the
          mouse in HELP and want to speed up HELP startup, set
          HelpOptions = /X in 4DOS.INI.  This will disable all mouse access
          in the HELP system.

   Information on Specific Products
   --------------------------------

   The information below is listed alphabetically by product, with
   manufacturers' names included.  MS-DOS commands are listed before other
   software products.

   Items marked with two asterisks [**] after the product name were
   supplied by users, and have not been tested by JP Software.


      MS-DOS APPEND Command:

          Unlike most other commands in MS-DOS, APPEND has both an external
          portion and an undocumented internal portion.  The first time
          APPEND is run the external portion is executed, and loaded into
          memory as a TSR (memory-resident program).  Subsequent uses of
          APPEND to adjust the APPEND path use an undocumented internal
          interface between COMMAND.COM and the TSR portion of APPEND.

          4DOS does not support the internal portion of APPEND command. 
          This means that you cannot change the APPEND path directly from
          4DOS.  However you can still use APPEND with 4DOS.

          APPEND should initially be loaded in the usual way, from AUTOEXEC
          or any other batch file, or from the command line.  However to
          change the APPEND path after APPEND has been loaded for the first
          time, you must run APPEND from COMMAND.COM, not from 4DOS.  To do
          this, enter the following command (modify the command
          appropriately if COMMAND.COM is not in the directory C:\):

                    c:\command /c append [new append path list]

          You could also set up a 4DOS alias to do the above command for
          you, for example:

                    alias app `c:\command /c append`

          which would be invoked with the command

                    app [new path list]

          The /X switch can be used, and it will affect 4DOS directory
          searches for many 4DOS commands (as it does for COMMAND.COM). 
          Please note that this makes APPEND very dangerous:  if you APPEND
          a directory with /X and then (say) delete *.BAK when no such
          files exist in the current directory, then the .BAK files in the
          APPENDed directory will be deleted instead.

          The APPEND /E switch will not work with 4DOS.

      !   CAUTION:  In our opinion APPEND is a dangerous command.  It is
          capable of "fooling" programs into thinking they are accessing
          one file when they are really accessing another one with the same
          name in a different directory.  This can either do just what you
          want, or cause all sorts of trouble, depending on the
          circumstances.  In particular, this behavior can cause 4DOS to
          place descriptions which go with files in one directory in the
          description file for another directory, because with APPEND
          running 4DOS can't tell whether APPEND has opened a file
          different from the one it asked for.

          If you must use APPEND to make certain applications work, we
          STRONGLY suggest that you set up the aliases described above, and
          load APPEND in AUTOEXEC.BAT with an empty path.  Then, for each
          application, set up an alias to run it that is similar to the
          following:

              alias myprog `app c:\mydata^d:\util\myprog.exe^app ;`

          This alias sets the APPEND path, runs the application, and clears
          the APPEND path.  When used in this way APPEND is less likely to
          cause trouble because it is disabled except when it is explicitly
          needed.

          In MS-DOS 4.0 and above, and in OS/2 2.x, the APPEND /PATH:OFF
          switch mitigates this problem somewhat; in particular it will
          keep 4DOS file description files from getting mixed up between
          directories.  For this reason 4DOS will automatically set this
          switch if it detects that you are running APPEND and DOS 4.0 or
          above.


      MS-DOS 6.x DBLSPACE:

          4DOS fully supports DBLSPACE compressed drives.  You can display
          and sort by compression ratios on DBLSPACE drives with the DIR /C
          and /O:c switches (the same switches also work with SELECT).  See
          your Reference Manual or the online help for details on these
          switches.


      MS-DOS 6.x HELP Command:

          MS-DOS 6.0 and above include a complete on-line help system. 
          Most of the time you probably won't need to access that system,
          because all of the internal commands and most external DOS
          utilities it discusses are also covered by the 4DOS help system.

          The MS-DOS 6 help also includes information on some commands
          which are not covered by the 4DOS help system.  These include
          more complex parts of MS-DOS 6 such as DBLSPACE (a disk
          compression utility) and MEMMMAKER; some commands which are not



   4DOS 5.0  [11-23-93]          APPNOTES.DOC                       page 11


          relevant to 4DOS users; and some rarely-used commands.  (A
          complete list is available in the MS-DOS 6 topic in the 4DOS
          online help system.)

          If you need to access MS-DOS 6 help for information on such
          topics, you can do so with an alias like this one, which assigns
          the command DOSHELP to load the MS-DOS 6 help system:

                    alias doshelp c:\dos\help.com

          If you prefer, you can use the HELP command to refer to MS-DOS
          6.0 help and another command such as 4DHELP to run 4DOS help. 
          For example:

                    alias help c:\dos\help.com
                    alias 4dhelp *help

          In all of the above aliases, adjust the path used if your DOS
          files are not in the C:\DOS directory.  For more information on
          aliases see the ALIAS command in your 4DOS manual or the online
          4DOS help.


      MS-DOS FASTOPEN Command:

          The MS-DOS FASTOPEN command generally works with 4DOS, but does
          not properly detect renamed directories, and may have similar
          problems when directories are removed.  This is a problem in
          FASTOPEN, not in 4DOS.  If you use FASTOPEN and rename a
          directory with the 4DOS REN command, then do a DIR command, you
          may see the old name and not the new one displayed; you may also
          occasionally have trouble accessing files under the new name. 
          You can usually solve this problem by including a DiskReset = Yes
          directive in 4DOS.INI.  If DiskReset = Yes does not work, the
          only other solution we are aware of is to reboot your system
          after renaming a directory.

          Our opinion is that, if you have the memory to support it, a disk
          caching program will provide a much greater and more effective
          performance improvement than FASTOPEN (but don't run both at the
          same time!).


      MS-DOS 4.0 and above FORMAT /S and SYS Commands:

   5.0    The FORMAT /S and SYS commands in DOS 4 and above will copy
          4DOS.COM to a newly formatted floppy disk and rename it
          COMMAND.COM, which may not be what you want and is confusing at
          best.  See the discussion of "4DOS and DOS" in the 4DOS
          Introduction and Installation Guide for more information on this
          issue.

      MS-DOS 6.x MEMMAKER Command:

          4DOS version 5 is fully compatible with MemMaker.  MemMaker adds
          commands to the end of your AUTOEXEC.BAT file during its
          operation, and removes them when it is finished.  If for some
          reason you have used a QUIT command in AUTOEXEC.BAT, remove it
          before running MemMaker.  Otherwise, MemMaker's commands will not
          run and the memory optimization process will not work properly.


      MS-DOS 6.x MOVE Command:

          MS-DOS 6 includes an external MOVE command which is generally
          compatible with the 4DOS MOVE command.

          The syntax and features of the MS-DOS 6 MOVE command are slightly
          different than those offered by 4DOS's MOVE, so batch files
          written for one command may not work exactly the same way with
          the other, especially if more advanced or complex features are
          used.  If you write batch files which use both commands, check
          the 4DOS and MS-DOS 6 documentation for your particular usage.


      MS-DOS 4.0 and above SELECT Command:

          In MS-DOS 4.0 and above, a SELECT command was included.  This
          external command is totally unrelated to the 4DOS internal SELECT
          command.  If you need to use both, you can set up aliases to
          adjust how the command names are handled.  For example, the
          following two aliases set up SELECT to access the DOS 4.0
          external SELECT command (assumed to be stored in
          C:\DOS\SELECT.EXE), and SEL to access the internal 4DOS SELECT
          command:

                    alias select c:\dos\select.exe
                    alias sel *select


      1DIR+ (Bourbaki):

          The information below was obtained from tests with 1DIR+ version
          3.02, and verified with version 3.5 as well.

          1DIR+ will work properly under 4DOS in its partially resident or
          EMS modes when set up as described below.  It will work in its
          fully resident mode but cannot reliably exit back to 4DOS once
          started.

          If your copy of 1DIR+ is set up for fully resident mode, you can
          load it into memory under 4DOS to switch it to partially resident
          or EMS mode.  To do so, from the directory where you normally run
          1DIR+, type the commands:



   4DOS 5.0  [11-23-93]          APPNOTES.DOC                       page 13


                    setdos /l1
                    1dirplus

          When 1DIR+ starts go to the "Wonder" / "Setup" menu and switch
          the mode to partially resident or EMS.  Hit Esc to exit, and take
          the "Exit/Save" option (not "Save/Reset").  Back at the main
          menu, exit with "Wonder" / "Exit".  At this point the system will
          probably hang.  Reboot your computer.  You should then be able to
          run 1DIR+ as described below.

          The above steps only need to be done once, when you install or
          re-install 1DIR+.

          Once 1DIR+ is set to EMS or partially-resident mode, you can
          start it from 4DOS using the following alias:

                    alias 1dir `setdos /L1 ^ 1dirplus`

          The SETDOS /L1 is necessary to allow 1DIR+ to send command lines
          to 4DOS.

          You must do a SETDOS /L0 when you are done with 1DIR+ in order to
          get normal 4DOS command-line editing back.  You can NOT do this
          within the alias above, as 1DIR+ returns to 4DOS in order to
          accomplish its work, and you don't want to switch back to /L0
          mode until 1DIRPLUS has been removed from memory.  If, after
          exiting from 1DIR+, you find that 4DOS's command line editing and
          history are unavailable, it is because you forgot to do the
          SETDOS /L0.  If you go in and out of 1DIR+ regularly aliases like
          the following can be used to make the process quick:

                    alias 1d `setdos /L1 ^ 1dirplus`
                    alias 1e setdos /L0

          If you run batch files from the 1DIRPLUS "compose" feature, you
          may find that INPUT commands in the batch file don't work
          properly unless they are preceded by SETDOS /L0.  You must also
          do a SETDOS /L1 before the end of the batch file, or 1DIRPLUS
          won't pop up properly when the batch file is finished.  For
          example:

                    setdos /l0
                    input Enter your name:  %%name
                    setdos /l1


      3COM Networks (3Com):  [**]

          Some users report that 3Com network software will not load
          properly if UMBLoad = Yes is used in 4DOS.INI.  If you have
          trouble with a 3Com network and 4DOS, try removing the UMBLoad
          and UMBEnvironment directives from your 4DOS.INI file.

      ANSI.SYS (various manufacturers):

          If you have trouble with screen scrolling in 43-line or 50-line
          mode, try a different version of ANSI.  We have had good results
          with PC Magazine's free utility ANSI.COM, and with the ANSI-
          UV.SYS program distributed with Personics' UltraVision EGA / VGA
          enhancement software.

          Some display-related device drivers may "fool" 4DOS into thinking
          an ANSI driver is present when this is not the case.  If this
          happens you will see ANSI strings like "[2J" displayed on-screen
          when you use the CLS and COLOR commands.  To correct the problem,
          place an ANSI = No directive in 4DOS.INI, or a SETDOS /A2 command
          in AUTOEXEC.BAT.

   5.0    Similarly, 4DOS may not be able to detect some ANSI drivers, in
          which case the colors you set with CLS and COLOR will not be
          "sticky" (i.e. they will be lost when you run an application, or
          otherwise change the display color).  To correct the problem,
          place an ANSI = Yes directive in 4DOS.INI, or a SETDOS /A1
          command in AUTOEXEC.BAT.


      Bookshelf CD-ROM (Microsoft):  [**]

          Microsoft Bookshelf uses the environment variable CDPATH, which
          is also used (for a totally different purpose) by 4DOS.  If you
          are using MS Bookshelf and want to set a CDPATH variable for
          4DOS, set _CDPATH instead.  4DOS will search for _CDPATH first;
          when it is found, 4DOS will use it, and ignore CDPATH.


      DESQview (Quarterdeck):

   5.0    4DOS works well as both the primary shell loaded before DESQview,
          and as the secondary shell loaded inside any DESQview window. 
          The general information about multitaskers in Chapter 3 of the
          4DOS Introduction and Installation Guide applies to DESQview as
          well.  You should read it before continuing with this discussion.

          To use 4DOS as a secondary shell with DESQview, you must add it
          to your DESQview "Open Window" menu.  To do this, select the Add
          a Program option, then press the "O" key (for Other Program). 
          Press Enter and you will get an Add a Program window.  You'll
          need to modify settings on the standard first screen, and on the
          second "advanced options" screen.  Set the Program Name to
          C:\4DOS\4DOS.COM (adjust the drive and path for your own
          computer).  Set the Parameters to whatever 4DOS startup options
          you want, but do not use /C or /P.  For other DESQview
          parameters, the defaults are workable with the following changes:




   4DOS 5.0  [11-23-93]          APPNOTES.DOC                       page 15


          To run 4DOS in a full-screen window:

              Writes Text Directly to Screen:    Y    (screen 1)
              Virtualize Text / Graphics:        N    (screen 1)
              Close on Exit to DOS:              Y    (screen 2)
              Uses its Own Colors:               Y    (screen 2)

          To run 4DOS in a window smaller than the full screen:

              Writes Text Directly to Screen:    N    (screen 1)
              Virtualize Text / Graphics:        Y/T  (screen 1)
              Close on Exit to DOS:              Y    (screen 2)
              Uses its Own Colors:               Y    (screen 2)

          4DOS is written to be "DESQview-aware", and will not "bleed
          through" to other windows when running full-screen commands such
          as HELP, LIST, or SELECT.

          You should normally exit a DESQview 4DOS window with the EXIT
          command, rather than with the Close option on DESQview's main
          menu.  If you do use the Close option while at the 4DOS prompt,
          4DOS will be notified of your action and will clean up its
          resources (for example, the shell number and disk swap file in
          use in that window).  However this notification has a side-
          effect:  it disables the Quit option on the DESQview main menu
          (this is a feature of DESQview).  To disable the notification and
          reenable the Quit option, you can use a DVCleanup = No directive
          in 4DOS.INI.  If you do so, be sure to exit 4DOS windows with the
          EXIT command to avoid leaving stray swap files on your disk or
          inadvertently using up 4DOS shell numbers.

          Some users report that DESQview uses all upper memory space when
          it loads, leaving no upper memory available to 4DOS.  If you have
          UMBLoad and / or UMBEnvironment set to Yes in 4DOS.INI, this will
          result in a couple of harmless error messages when 4DOS is
          started under DESQview.  To eliminate these messages, place the
          following lines at the end of 4DOS.INI:

                    [Secondary]
                    UMBLoad = No
                    UMBEnvironment = No

          DESQview includes the ability to assign "logical drives" to
          subdirectory paths to make access to commonly used directories
          easier, or to support older applications that can't handle
          subdirectories.  This is similar to the DOS SUBST command.  4DOS
          commands like DIR and COPY may not work as you expect on DESQview
          logical drives, because DESQview does not support certain
          standard DOS calls which 4DOS uses to determine whether a name
          you enter is the name of a file or a subdirectory.  If you are
          using specific filenames without wildcards, 4DOS commands will
          generally work properly on DESQview logical drives.  However

          problems may occur with "implied wildcards" (for example, when
          4DOS interprets DIR A* as DIR A*.*), filename completion, and
          other wildcard file access.  We know of no circumstances where
          these problems would cause a loss of data.  However for the sake
          of safety, when using DESQview logical drives we suggest you use
          the /N switches on commands like COPY and MOVE to verify the
          command's operation before files are actually modified.

          Under 4DOS, the DESQview DOS Services option will not work in its
          default configuration.  To make DOS Services work under 4DOS, you
          must first create a batch file, DOSSERV.BAT, in your DESQview
          directory to run DOS Services under COMMAND.COM.  (We are
          assuming that DESQview is in directory C:\DV and COMMAND.COM is
          in directory C:\; you will need to modify the settings below if
          your system is configured differently.)  The batch file is:

                    set comspec=c:\command.com
                    c:\dv\dosserv
                    c:\command
                    exit

          Then, make the following changes on the DESQview change a program
          screen for DOS Services (items marked ** are on the second page
          of the screen):

                    *   Memory Allocation = 128K or greater
                    *   Program Name = C:\DV\DOSSERV.BAT (modify from
                        previous value of C:\DV\DOSSERV).
                    **  Close on Exit to DOS = N
                    **  System Memory = 10K or greater
                    **  Allow Close Window = N

          Once these steps are taken, you should be able to open the DOS
          Services window normally.  However you will not be able to close
          it with a close window command.  Instead, go to the window where
          DOS Services allows you to compose a DOS command, and type EXIT
          to close the window.


      DOORWAY BBS Software:

          DOORWAY uses the caret [^] in certain command line arguments. 
          4DOS will interpret this symbol as a command separator, and will
          not pass the line to DOORWAY properly.  You can work around this
          problem by changing your 4DOS command separator permanently (with
          the CommandSep directive in 4DOS.INI) or temporarily when
          starting DOORWAY (with the SETDOS /C command), or by using the
          4DOS escape character (ctrl-X) before each caret in the DOORWAY
          command line.


      DR DOS / Novell DOS (Novell):



   4DOS 5.0  [11-23-93]          APPNOTES.DOC                       page 17


   5.0    4DOS will work properly as a command processor (including as the
          primary shell) under DR DOS / Novell DOS 3.4 and above, including
          Novell DOS 7.0.  Some aspects of using 4DOS with DR DOS / Novell
          DOS are discussed in Chapter 3 of the 4DOS Introduction and
          Installation Guide.  Be sure to read that information before
          continuing with this section.

          Internal vs. External Commands:

              DR DOS 5.0's design makes the ASSIGN, JOIN, MORE, and SUBST
              commands internal (in MS-DOS / PC-DOS they are external). 
              4DOS supports all MS-DOS internal commands, but does not have
              internal support for ASSIGN, JOIN, MORE, and SUBST.  To
              access these DR DOS internal commands when using 4DOS as the
              command processor, you must set up aliases which run DR DOS's
              COMMAND.COM.  The following 4DOS aliases accomplish this
              (adjust these if COMMAND.COM is not in C:\):

                    alias assign `c:\command /c assign %&`
                    alias join `c:\command /c join %&`
                    alias more `c:\command /c more %&`
                    alias subst `c:\command /c subst %&`

              In DR DOS 6, ASSIGN, JOIN, and SUBST were changed back to
              external commands, so the corresponding aliases are not
              necessary.

              For the MORE command, a much better alternative can be set up
              by aliasing it to the 4DOS LIST command:

                    alias more list /s

              This provides a scrollable, full-screen display rather than
              the simple paged display offered by DR DOS (or MS-DOS) MORE.

          HILOAD:

              The 4DOS LH / LOADHIGH command does not work properly under
              the March 1993 update release of DR DOS 6.  We are currently
              working with Novell to resolve this difficulty, which appears
              to be due to internal changes in the March 1993 release.  You
              can work around the problem by aliasing LH to use DR DOS
              COMMAND.COM, for example:

                    alias lh c:\drdos\command.com lh

              This problem is not present in any other version of DR DOS /
              Novell DOS, including version 7.0.

          CONFIG.SYS SETs:





   4DOS 5.0  [11-23-93]          APPNOTES.DOC                       page 18


              DR DOS allows you to put SET commands in CONFIG.SYS to set
              environment variables.  4DOS will retrieve this information
              and store it in the 4DOS environment, as DR DOS COMMAND.COM
              does.

          TASKMAX:

              4DOS will work with TASKMAX and TASKMGR (we refer to both as
              TASKMAX here), as long as you start new tasks according to
              the instructions below.

              You may need to experiment with the UMBLoad directive in
              4DOS.INI when running TASKMAX.  Depending on your system
              configuration and your version of TASKMAX, using
              UMBLoad = Yes may make the system more or less stable.  We do
              recommend that you use UMBLoad = Yes if it works on your
              system, as this allows 4DOS better control over secondary
              shell startups under TASKMAX.

              When using 4DOS with TASKMAX you can NOT use the Ins key on
              the TASKMAX menu to start new tasks.  You must use the
              TASKMAX /C command instead.  If you do not, your system will
              hang.  (This is due to assumptions TASKMAX must make when
              starting new tasks.  These assumptions are valid for
              COMMAND.COM, but not for 4DOS.)

              For example, this command:

                    taskmax /c c:\4dos.com

              will start a new secondary copy of 4DOS as a new task,, and
              display a prompt.  The same approach should be used when
              starting any task which needs a command processor.  To start
              a task which runs a .BTM or .BAT file, use a command like
              this:

                    taskmax /c c:\4dos.com /c startwp.bat

              This tells 4DOS to run the specified batch file, and exit
              automatically (removing the task from the task list) when the
              batch file is done.

              If you have tasks you start regularly using the approach
              described above, use a batch file or a set of 4DOS aliases to
              help automate the process.


      Epsilon (Lugaru Software):  [**]

          Epsilon can run 4DOS as a concurrent process, and pass commands
          to 4DOS for execution.  In this mode it traps 4DOS's input
          requests and feeds the keystrokes to 4DOS.  However it does not



   4DOS 5.0  [11-23-93]          APPNOTES.DOC                       page 19


          feed backspaces etc. -- only actual characters.  This means that
          editing of input isn't seen by 4DOS.  To fix the problem, either
          run 4DOS as a shell, and not as a concurrent process, or use a
          SETDOS /L1 for the copy of 4DOS that is run under Epsilon.  

          To use the more flexible SETDOS /L1 approach you must use
          4START.BAT (or .BTM) to set up the SETDOS /L1 before running
          Epsilon.  Epsilon sets the environment variable EPSRUNS=Y
          whenever it starts a secondary shell; you can use this variable
          to set up 4START to work with Epsilon.  Place the following line
          in 4START to issue the SETDOS /L1 command in a secondary shell
          started by Epsilon, but ignore it otherwise:

                    if "%epsruns"=="Y" setdos /l1


      FoxPro (Microsoft):  [**]

          FoxPro works well with 4DOS, but may have trouble if 4DOS or the
          master environment is loaded high (in a UMB).  If you experience
          compatibility problems between FoxPro and 4DOS, try removing any
          UMBEnvironment = Yes line in 4DOS.INI; if that doesn't help, try
          removing any UMBLoad = Yes line as well.


      Hijaak (Inset Systems):

   5.0    4DOS is generally compatible with Hijaak.  However the DOSCAP
          utility can sometimes interfere with 4DOS's disk swap file,
          causing the system to hang.  If you experience a problem with
          DOSCAP and disk swapping, configure your system to swap to EMS or
          XMS memory.


      LapLink (Traveling Software):  [**]

          LapLink's "self-cloning" feature is not compatible with 4DOS's
          CTTY command.  If you need to use the self-cloning feature, start
          a temporary copy of COMMAND.COM first (see "Running 4DOS along
          with COMMAND>COM" at the beginning of this file for details).


      LOGIMENU (Logitech):  [**]

          When using Logitech's LOGIMENU with 4DOS, LOGIMENU may leave a
          file open each time a menu is unloaded.  Some users have been
          able to work around this problem by loading the menu from a
          floppy disk or RAM disk rather than the hard disk, but in general
          you will probably need to load and unload LOGIMENU with a product
          like MARK and RELEASE (from TurboPower's freeware TSRCOM package,
          available on the 4DOS Utility Disk), which can help to clean up
          files left open by other programs.

      NDIS Network Drivers:

   5.0    Under 4DOS, some NDIS network drivers may hang your system when
          the NETBIND program is run in AUTOEXEC.BAT.  This is because
          these drivers use memory without allocating it, and 4DOS is then
          unable to avoid overwriting the memory used by the drivers.  When
          NETBIND runs it attempts to use the corrupted memory area, and
          the system hangs.  If you have this problem, you can solve it
          using the following steps:

              (1) Add this line to 4DOS.INI:

                         MaxLoadAddress=448

              (2) Make sure that NETBIND is the FIRST external program to
              run after 4DOS starts.  Do not run ANY other external program
              prior to NETBIND, in either 4START or AUTOEXEC.

              (3) If you cannot run NETBIND first, add a SWAPPING OFF
              command at the beginning of AUTOEXEC, and a SWAPPING ON
              command immediately before NETBIND is run.  However, we
              strongly recommend that you run NETBIND first if at all
              possible.

          Many NDIS drivers do not exhibit this problem; if your NDIS
          drivers work properly, there is no need to make the changes shown
          above.


      Netware (Novell):

   5.0    Before reading this information be sure you have read the section
          on 4DOS and Novell Netware in Chapter 3 of the 4DOS Introduction
          and Installation Guide.  The discussion below covers certain
          specific problems; if your copy of 4DOS is working properly with
          Netware, you may not need to read it at all.  See the following
          section for details on using 4DOS with diskless workstations
          under Novell Netware.

          Some versions of Netware may occasionally produce a "pipe not
          found" message when loading under 4DOS.  This message refers to
          Netware features related to COMMAND.COM, and does not apply to
          4DOS; the message can be ignored.

          If you use the 4DOS FOR (@filename) command or the %@FILEOPEN and
          %@FILEREAD variable functions to process lines from a file, you
          may find that the read is terminated after the first line.  This
          is because Netware is closing the file before 4DOS is finished
          with it.  To work around this problem, add the following line to
          your NET.CFG or SHELL.CFG file (SHELL.CFG is used in older
          versions of Netware, and NET.CFG in more recent versions):



   4DOS 5.0  [11-23-93]          APPNOTES.DOC                       page 21


                    EOJ=OFF

          In certain extremely rare circumstances using EOJ=OFF can leave
          files open on your server if an application does not close them
          properly.  We have never seen this problem occur in practice but
          you may wish to keep it in mind if you must use EOJ=OFF to
          prevent Netware from closing files you are processing.

          If you use 4DOS input redirection in a .BAT file which resides on
          a Netware drive, you may experience incorrect file assignments on
          some systems.  When this occurs, an application run from within
          the batch file, or a secondary shell run from such an
          application, may loop forever attempting to read lines from the
          batch file rather than accepting input from the keyboard.  For
          example:

                    copy /r *.* g: < YES
                    wp
                    rem  Now if the user shells from WP, the system will
                    rem  loop forever reading lines from the batch file or
                    rem  blank lines at the prompt.

          This problem occurs because Netware does not handle file
          assignments properly when 4DOS input redirection is used in a
          .BAT file.  We are awaiting a solution to this problem from
          Novell.  You can work around it in several ways:

              * Change the batch file to a .BTM file.

              * Place the file BTM mode with the LOADBTM command at any
              point prior to the use of input redirection.

              * Move the file to a non-Netware drive.

              * User reports indicate that adding a line which does a
              "dummy" output redirection just before the input redirection
              will prevent the problem from occurring.  For example:

                    echo This is junk > junk.dat
                    copy /r *.* g: < YES
                    wp
                    del junk.dat

          When loading a secondary 4DOS shell under Netware you can swap to
          a network drive if you wish, but you MUST set SwapReopen = Yes in
          4DOS.INI, or Netware will close the file and 4DOS will halt with
          a swap file error.  You can also avoid this problem by swapping
          to EMS, XMS, or a local hard disk or RAM disk.

          The UMBLoad directive in 4DOS.INI is compatible with Netware. 
          The UMBEnvironment directive is compatible with Netware 3.11 and
          above, but not with earlier versions.



   4DOS 5.0  [11-23-93]          APPNOTES.DOC                       page 22


          This technique is based on contributions from a number of 4DOS
          users.  It has not been tested by JP Software but several users
          have found it to work well.


      Netware Diskless Workstations (Novell):

          4DOS can be set up to run properly on Novell Netware diskless
          workstations which boot from the server.  To do so, you must make
          several changes to 4DOS.INI and your other startup files as
          detailed below.  The goal of all these changes is to ensure that
          there is NO access to the boot drive after the network software
          is loaded.

          In the discussion below, the term "boot image" refers to files on
          the A: drive image set up to boot the workstation.  This text
          assumes that your 4DOS files are in the server directory
          F:\SYSTEM\4DOS; be SURE to substitute the appropriate path for
          your network!

          The 4DOS directory on the server should contain at least a copy
          of 4DOS.COM, 4HELP.EXE, and 4DOS.HLP.  In this description we
          assume other files like secondary copies of 4START and 4DOS.INI
          are stored there as well.  You can move any of these files to
          another network directory if you change the corresponding
          directive below.
    
          1) Place a copy of 4DOS.COM into the boot image and be sure the
          SHELL command in the boot image CONFIG.SYS looks like this:
    
              SHELL=\4DOS.COM @\4DOS.INI /P

          2) Create a boot image 4DOS.INI file if you don't have one.  Add
          these lines to the file:

                    4StartPath=\
                    AutoExecPath=\
                    HelpPath=F:\SYSTEM\4DOS\
                    NextINIFile=F:\SYSTEM\4DOS\4DOS.INI

          This forces secondary copies of 4DOS to read the INI file from
          the network, and not from the boot drive.  Any directives which
          you might normally put in the [Secondary] section of 4DOS.INI
          should go into this file (see step 7), and not in the 4DOS.INI
          file that is part of the boot image.

          3) If you want a 4START file for the primary shell, create one
          and make it part of the boot image.

          4) Rename your boot image AUTOEXEC file to AUTOEXEC.BTM.  4DOS
          reads each line of a BAT file separately, and keeping AUTOEXEC as

          a BAT file will therefore cause access to the boot image drive
          after the network is loaded.

          This advice violates the usual rule that TSRs should not be
          loaded from a BTM file.  As a result you will have a small "hole"
          in memory when AUTOEXEC is done.  Generally such holes waste a
          small amount of memory, but cause no other trouble, and users
          have not reported any ill effects from this approach.

          5) Be sure that in AUTOEXEC.BTM you switch the current drive and
          directory to a network drive and directory at some point before
          the file terminates, for example with a command like CDD F:\. 
          Otherwise, the current drive will remain the boot drive and 4DOS
          will attempt to access that drive.

          Also be sure that you set the COMSPEC variable to the copy of
          4DOS on the network, for example:

                    SET COMSPEC=F:\SYSTEM\4DOS\4DOS.COM

          If you don't, secondary shells will not work properly from
          applications run on the workstation.
    
          6) Create a new boot image AUTOEXEC.BAT file with one line in it
          which reads:

                    AUTOEXEC.BTM

          This transfers control to the AUTOEXEC.BTM file as soon as 4DOS
          starts.
    
          7) Create the secondary INI file <4DOS path>\4DOS.INI (the one
          referred to in the NextINIFile directive in step 2 above), and
          put at least the following line in it:

                    4StartPath=F:\SYSTEM\4DOS\
    
          This forces 4DOS to find 4START and 4EXIT for secondary shells on
          the network drive, and prevents it from attempting to look for
          these files on the boot drive.  There need not be a 4START or
          4EXIT file in this directory, but if you do want to use 4START or
          4EXIT for secondary shells they must be in the specified network
          directory.

          Any other 4DOS.INI directives for secondary shells should also go
          into this file, and not in the 4DOS.INI file that is part of the
          boot image. 

          8) If you wish to swap secondary shells to a network drive add
          this line to the secondary 4DOS.INI file:

                    SwapReopen=Yes



   4DOS 5.0  [11-23-93]          APPNOTES.DOC                       page 24


          After these changes are made, generate a boot image and set up
          the diskless workstation normally.  4DOS should start and operate
          properly when you boot the workstation.


      OS/2 1.x and 2.x (IBM):

          4DOS works properly as the shell in OS/2 DOS sessions under OS/2
          1.2, 1.3, 2.0, and 2.1.  For complete details see Chapter 4 of
          the 4DOS Introduction and Installation Guide.

          If you see a message like "Cannot find OSO001.MSG" when running
          external utilities like TREE or DISKCOPY in OS/2 DOS sessions,
          you probably need to include the line:

                    loadhigh append c:\os2;c:\os2\system

          in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file used by these DOS sessions, or set up
          the append path in an alias or batch file used to run such
          programs (change the drive letter if OS/2 is installed on a
          different drive).  Be sure to read the notes and cautions on
          MS-DOS APPEND in this file before using APPEND.

          If you use OS/2, you will probably want to use our companion
          product 4OS2 in your OS/2 sessions.  See the ORDERINF.DOC file
          for more information.


      QEMM and QRAM (Quarterdeck):

          Both QEMM and QRAM are compatible with 4DOS, and will allow you
          to load the 4DOS resident code and the master environment into
          high DOS memory (UMBs) via the UMBLoad and UMBEnvironment
          directives in 4DOS.INI.  For these directives to work with QRAM
          you must have QEXT loaded also (this is the normal method of
          loading QRAM).

          QEMM's Stealth mode is compatible with 4DOS, but can decrease
          general system stability on some systems.  If you have unusual
          problems or system hangs with Stealth turned on, try turning it
          off and see if the problems clear up (this is the procedure
          recommended by Quarterdeck in their Stealth documentation).

          If you use FILES.COM to load part of the DOS file handle table
          into high memory, you must follow Quarterdeck's recommendations
          and keep a minimum of FILES=8 in CONFIG.SYS.  Lower values may
          cause 4DOS to hang during boot, especially if disk swapping is
          used.

   5.0    If you use QEMM's OPTIMIZE and your AUTOEXEC has 4DOS-specific
          commands like GLOBAL, IFF, aliases, etc., OPTIMIZE will recognize
          them based on the 4DOS.CMD file distributed with QEMM.  This



   4DOS 5.0  [11-23-93]          APPNOTES.DOC                       page 25


          ASCII file contains a simple list of 4DOS commands.  If you have
          a version of 4DOS.CMD created before 4DOS 5.0 was released, you
          may want to add the new DO, KEYBD, ON and START commands to it to
          make it complete.  To use 4DOS.CMD it must be renamed to
          OPTIMIZE.EXC before running OPTIMIZE; see your QEMM documentation
          for details.

   5.0    If you load 4DOS or 4DOS data blocks into upper memory, you can
          specify a particular upper memory region with UMBLoad and other
          similar directives in 4DOS.INI.  QEMM offers similar region
          selection capability for the command processor through its LOADHI
          command.  We recommend that you use the 4DOS internal directives
          for this purpose, rather than using LOADHI to select a specific
          region for 4DOS.


      RBase (MicroRim):  [**]

          When used with 4DOS disk swapping, some versions of RBase close
          4DOS's swap file when they exit.  This generates "4DOS
          Unrecoverable error DS" and other similar fatal error messages. 
          You can avoid this problem by changing 4DOS swapping to EMS or
          XMS, or by setting SwapReopen = Yes in 4DOS.INI.


      RoboComm Communications Software:  [**]

          If you have trouble shelling out of RoboComm (for example, to use
          an external protocol like DSZ), try increasing the setting for
          Files and Extract memory to 256K.


      Software Carousel (SoftLogic Solutions):

          Please see the general section on multitaskers in chapter 3 of
          the 4DOS Introduction and Installation Guide before reading this
          section.

          The information below applies to all versions of Software
          Carousel.

          Software Carousel will not work properly with 4DOS loaded as the
          primary shell.  It is designed with the assumption that
          COMMAND.COM is the system command processor, and contains logic
          which specifically depends on COMMAND.COM and the way it is
          written, and which actually modifies the copy of COMMAND.COM in
          memory.  This makes it impossible to write a program which works
          properly as an alternate command processor loaded underneath
          (i.e. before) Software Carousel.

          However, 4DOS can be run without difficulty inside a Software
          Carousel partition, if the instructions below are followed.



   4DOS 5.0  [11-23-93]          APPNOTES.DOC                       page 26


          When loading 4DOS into a Carousel partition, the best method is
          to leave the COMSPEC set to COMMAND.COM when Carousel is loaded. 
          4DOS should then be set up in the Carousel options file just like
          any other program.  For example, to load 4DOS into partition 1:

                    d:\path\4DOS.COM [parameters] [filename]

          where:

              d:\path         is the drive and path where 4DOS.COM is
                              located

              [parameters]    is any 4DOS command line parameters (/E,
                              @ininame, etc.; do NOT use /P here)

              [filename]      is the name of a batch file to be executed
                              when the partition is started

          To use different 4DOS.INI files for different Software Carousel
          partitions, use the "@ininame" parameter in the "parameters"
          section of your Carousel setup to invoke a specific file.  For
          example, the parameters could be set to @D:\WP\4DOSWP.INI to use
          that initialization file for the WP partition.

          Because 4DOS can only be loaded in a partition when running
          Software Carousel, and not as the primary command processor,
          using 4DOS disk swapping in multiple partitions is subject to the
          cautionary note on this subject in the general information
          section on multitaskers in Chapter 3 of the 4DOS Introduction and
          Installation Guide; please read it carefully.  As stated in that
          note, if you use disk swapping you will probably want to use the
          UniqueSwapName directive in 4DOS.INI to avoid swap file name
          conflicts.


      Stacker (Stac Electronics):

   5.0    4DOS fully supports Stacker compressed drives.  At this time the
          4DOS DIR and SELECT commands cannot display compression ratios on
          Stacker drives, because certain information required for this
          function is not readily available to 4DOS under the current
          Stacker software.  We are working with Stac Electronics to
          resolve this issue, and expect to provide compression ratio
          support for Stacker drives in a future version of 4DOS.


      SuperStor (AddStor, Novell):

   5.0    4DOS fully supports SuperStor compressed drives, under both the
          stand-alone version of SuperStor from AddStor, and the version of
          SuperStor bundled with DR DOS / Novell DOS.  You can display and
          sort by compression ratios on SuperStor drives with the DIR /C



   4DOS 5.0  [11-23-93]          APPNOTES.DOC                       page 27


          and /O:c switches (the same switches also work with SELECT).  See
          your Reference Manual or the online help for details on these
          switches.


      TSRCOM Utilities (TurboPower Software):

          The TSRCOM utilities will work properly with 4DOS as long as you
          use TSRCOM version 2.6 or later.  The current release is version
          3.5, and is available on the 4DOS Utility Disk and on many
          bulletin boards and on-line systems.

          If you use TSRCOM's MARK and RELEASE to manage your TSRs, 4DOS
          swapping (as set with the SWAPPING command) must be in the same
          state when RELEASE is run as it was when MARK (or FMARK) was run. 
          This is a characteristic of the design of MARK and RELEASE (or
          any other such products), and not a bug.  If you do not observe
          this rule (for example, if you run MARK with SWAPPING OFF in
          AUTOEXEC and later run RELEASE from the prompt with SWAPPING ON),
          you may receive unusual error messages or hang your system.  The
          same restriction applies to MARKNET and RELNET.


      UltraVision (Personics):

          The DE program distributed with UltraVision is written
          specifically for COMMAND.COM, and cannot be used to set directory
          colors with 4DOS.  Use 4DOS's built-in directory colorization
          instead.


      Windows 3.x (Microsoft):

          Most information about Windows is in chapter 3 of the 4DOS
          Introduction and Installation Guide.  4DOS has been tested
          thoroughly and works well with Windows.

          Under some circumstances you may find that Windows overrides the
          environment size specified in your 4DOS.INI file, and creates a
          smaller environment.  This can leave insufficient environment
          space for your 4DOS sessions running under Windows.  If you
          experience this problem, edit the SYSTEM.INI file in your Windows
          directory, and find the section labelled [NonWindowsApp].  Add
          the following line to this section:

                    CommandEnvSize = 0

          This tells Windows not to force a particular environment size,
          which will allow 4DOS to set the size itself.

          If you set up a PIF file for 4DOS, be sure to allow your 4DOS
          sessions access to the same type of memory used to swap your



   4DOS 5.0  [11-23-93]          APPNOTES.DOC                       page 28


          primary shell.  If you do not, your Windows sessions may not be
          able to retrieve aliases and the command history from the primary
          shell.  For example, if the primary shell swaps to XMS memory,
          and you set the XMS memory limit to 0 in the PIF file, your 4DOS
          sessions under Windows may start without inheriting aliases and
          history from the primary shell.

          If you set up a PIF file please note that the 4DOS MEMORY command
          will report the maximum amount of EMS memory which Windows can
          theoretically make available in that window.  Because Windows
          provides a virtual memory capability, this number may be much
          larger than the size of physical RAM.  For example, if you set
          the EMS Limit in your PIF file to -1, Windows will report total
          EMS memory of 64 MB to 4DOS as this is the theoretical limit on
          Windows' virtual memory manager.  Virtual memory figures which
          give the appearance of excess memory are a feature of Windows,
          and not a bug in 4DOS.


      XyWrite (XyQuest):  [**]

          XyWrite's "shell to DOS" capability shells to COMMAND.COM, even
          if you have your COMSPEC variable set to 4DOS.  The only way we
          know of to work around the problem is to make a copy of 4DOS.COM
          and call it COMMAND.COM.  If you do this, be sure to save the
          real COMMAND.COM in another directory in case you need it for
          another purpose.  Some users have reported that the same problem
          occurs with Signature, a newer word processor from XyQuest.


      Programs Requiring PATH to be Under 128 Characters:

          The following programs contain bugs which prevent them from
          working properly if you have a PATH which is over 128 characters
          long.  Since 4DOS allows you to create a PATH up to 255
          characters long this can appear to be a conflict between the
          program involved and 4DOS.  If your path is longer than 128
          characters, see Appendix A of the 4DOS Introduction and
          Installation Guide for information on creating a batch file to
          reduce the PATH length while one of these programs is running.

              Checkit (Touchstone):  [**]  Checkit version 3 requires a
              path length under 128 characters.

              Computer Select CD-ROM (Ziff-Davis):  [**]  Computer Select
              cannot find its help program if your PATH is over 128
              characters long.  

              RenderMan (AutoDesk):  RenderMan will hang your system if it
              is started with a PATH longer than 128 characters.

              VINES Network (Banyan):  [**]  VINES' installation may not
              work properly if your PATH is longer than 128 characters.

              Windows 3.0 (Microsoft):  The Windows 3 Setup Applications
              option, which scans your disk drives for applications to be
              added to Windows program groups, will not work properly if
              your PATH is more than 128 characters long.  This problem is
              fixed in Windows 3.1.

   5.0        Word for Windows 6.0 (Microsoft):  The Word for Windows
              version 6 help system will not work properly if your PATH is
              more than 128 characters long.  Microsoft is aware of this
              problem and will be releasing a fix.
