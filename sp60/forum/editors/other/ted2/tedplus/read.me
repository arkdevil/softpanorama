A few minor modifications to the excelent "Tiny Editor" from PC Mag.
	1)  Add a little color
	2)  <CR><LF> is the only newline interpreted
	3)  All keys enter their characters.
	4)  Don't add or hide CNTLZ's (don't need no stinkin cpm)
	5)  Use function 10 for extended keyboard. (tedalt.com doesn't)
	6)  Lose the DELETE LINE function
	7)  If cursor is in col 1 then DEL EOL is DEL LINE.
	8)  F9 is now a find function.
	9)  CNTL F9 is a repeat find.
