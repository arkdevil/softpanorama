      ROMANIZE - cyrillic text romanizer v1.00
      (C) Michael Bravo 1992

      The purpose of this program is to convert cyrillic texts into
      so-called 'polish' texts, for use by people who doesn't have
      appropriate screen drivers to read cyrillic onscreen.

      Use of the program is fairly easy - all translation is guided by a
      configuration file, containing two tokens per line - first is
      character code to translate and the second is string which will
      replace it in output file. Sample configuration is supplied.

      To run the program, type ROMANIZE <input filename> <output filename>
      from the DOS prompt. By default, program takes ROMANIZE.CTL as its
      configuration file, but you can specify some other name as a third
      parameter.

      That's all to it. Enjoy!
