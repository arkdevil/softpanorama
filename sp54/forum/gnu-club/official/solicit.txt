THE FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION

We are a nonprofit corporation whose purpose is to encourage the free
exchange of information by distributing a free integrated operating
system, GNU, that can run Un*x user programs.

The Free Software Foundation is seeking individual and corporate
sponsors for the following projects:

1. C Software Development Environment
 a. Portable C Compiler
 b. Source-level debugger
 c. Cross-reference and indexing of source code
 d. Performance metering tools
 We have a yacc-equivalent, a machine-language debugger,
 and a compiler for a limited subset of C; it must be extended.

2. GNU Kernel
 a. Upward-compatible with Un*x
 b. Architecture based on remote procedure call
 c. Improved file system: completely salvageable after
    a crash, version numbers on files
 We have a working mostly-Un*x-compatible kernel on which
 work is needed primarily in these three areas.

3. Bourne Shell
 We have a compatible replacement for the C shell
 from which this could be developed.

4. awk (pattern-matching data transformation language).
