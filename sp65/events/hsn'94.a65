1994 USENIX Symposium on High-Speed Networking
August 1-3, 1994
Claremont Hotel & Resort, Oakland, CA
*********************************************

The USENIX Association invites you to participate in a special
three-day Symposium on High-Speed Networking.

The participants will examine the current issues and trends in
high-speed networking, and explore the impact of high-speed networks on
systems and applications design.  In an attempt to temper the hype
about the "information superhighway" by presenting what is real today,
researchers from both the UNIX and the high-speed networking community
will share their experiences and the lessons they have learned on
different operating systems and high-speed networks.

We are privileged to have two outstanding networking researchers, Craig
Partridge and Van Jacobson, to each deliver a keynote address on the
first two days of the technical program.  The papers selected for
presentation at the Symposium represent a broad range of issues in
systems and networking design, from protocols and device drivers to
distributed computation and applications.  Invited speakers will
provide an overview of four high-speed networking testbeds in the
United States.. The Symposium will close with a panel session, allowing
for an open expression of diverse views on ATM (Asynchronous Transfer
Mode) technology.  Birds of a Feather sessions are scheduled for the
first evening of the Symposium, to facilitate informal discussions and
sharing of strategies on particular topics.

On the third day , USENIX will coordinate visits to some of the
high-speed networking testbeds in Berkeley:  BAGNet, BLANCA/XUNET and
MAGIC.  These visits will be offered to all Symposium participants on a
first-come, first-served basis.  We encourage you to pre-register for
this event early-on to ensure a space on these visits.

Join your fellow professionals in learning more about the realities of
high-speed networks and their implications for computing systems; how
the systems, and the way we use them, will change.

PRELIMINARY TECHNICAL PROGRAM 
*****************************
MONDAY, AUGUST 1 

9:00 - 10:30   Keynote Address:  High Performance Systems and
Protocols - Myths and  Realities 
    Craig Partridge, Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc.                 

In the past six years of high-speed networking research, a number
of persistent myths have cropped up.  These myths include the idea 
that TCP is a heavy weight and slow protocol, that a gigabit per 
second is a fast data rate, that UNIX cannot support high-performance 
real-time applications, and that data, voice and video traffic will 
aggregate well.

In this talk, Craig will argue that many of these ideas have been
proven to be myths.  TCP is as lightweight a reliable protocol as 
they come, a gigabit per second is quite slow, UNIX can support a wide
variety of real-time applications, and data, voice and video
appear likely to aggregate poorly (with important implications for 
network design).  Based on these ideas, Craig will make some 
predictions about how gigabit networking and high-speed systems are 
likely to evolve.                    

Craig is a senior research scientist at BBN where he is the lead 
scientist of BBN's gigabit networking project.  Prior to this work, 
he was on the technical staff of the Computer Science Network (CSNET)
project, also at BBN.  He is a consulting assistant professor
at Stanford, Editor-in-Chief of IEEE Network Magazine, and the author 
of the book, Gigabit Networking (1993 from Addison-Wesley).  He 
received his Ph.D. from Harvard University.

TUESDAY, AUGUST 2  

9:00 - 10:30  Second Keynote - Learning from the Present - Things that 
IP Got Right and  ATM got Wrong                        
    Van Jacobson, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory   

"We can never get rid of mouse ideas completely; they keep turning
up again and again, and nibble, nibble - - no matter how often
we drive them off.  The best way to keep them down is to have a few
good strong cat ideas to chase them.  - Samuel Butler"            

Some researchers feel ATM is the future of networking.  Others see it
as CCITT's attempt to adapt X.25 to space-division switch fabrics.
Whichever view turns out to be correct, it is clear that ATM violates
many of the architectural principles that have made IP and the IP
Internet the world's largest, most successful data network.  Most
of these principles have to do with the ability of the architecture 
to scale and evolve - - areas where design mistakes are especially 
damning since the errors are invisible until the system has become 
large and expensive or impossible to fundamentally change.  In a 
feeble attempt to avert, or at least presage, some costly disasters, 
this talk will try to stir up a chase between some of the "cat ideas" 
in IP and the "mouse ideas" of ATM. 

Van Jacobson is a staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.
He has been there sine 1972.  Most of his time is spent reading email 
& trying to keep his cat entertained.  It has been years since he did
anything useful.

FIELD TRIP DESCRIPTION: 
On the morning of August 3, we will coordinate visits to two local
high-speed networking testbed sites.  At the Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory, researchers will demonstrate the MAGIC testbed's Image
Server System technology (as presented in the paper by Tierney et al.),
as well as a teleconferencing application that runs over OC-3 (155
Mbps) links on the Bay Area Gigabit Network (BAGNet).  At the
University of California, Berkeley, researchers will demonstrate
teleconferncing and scientific visualization applications running over
XUNET (45 Mbps) and BLANCA (622 Mbps).  Visitors will also have the
opportunity to see as much of the supporting hardware as possible.

Complementary shuttle is provided for High-Speed Testbed visits.

BIRDS OF A FEATHER SESSIONS:  On Monday evening, August 1, space
is available for Birds of a Feather Sessions.  You can schedule your
BOF upon your arrival to the Symposium with a USENIX Staff
person.
