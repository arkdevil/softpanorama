CALL FOR PARTICIPATION-Artifacts session
PDC'94
Third Biennial Conference on Participatory Design
Chapel Hill, North Carolina
October 27-28, 1994

Sponsored by Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility
==================================================================

In the last few years, participatory approaches to design have gained
adherents around the world. Participatory design approaches have at
their core the involvement of workers in the design and development of
new technologies and work practices that have the potential of
improving their work lives. Collaborative design projects combine the
skills and knowledge of workers who will use or are using the
technology, with the technological and organizational expertise of
those involved in its development.

The first Participatory Design conference explored the historical roots
of this way of working, by bringing European practitioners together
with American researchers and industry developers. By the second
conference, PDC'92, participatory approaches to design had taken root
in the US, not only in research environments, but also at several
commercial firms. The goal at that time was to take a further step
towards defining and nurturing participatory design. In PDC `94, we
would like both to consider our ways of working and to foster a
substantial dialog among practitioners. The conference is an
international forum where this emerging community can meet, exchange
ideas and experiences, and investigate the incorporation of
participatory design approaches in new areas such as: product
development, long-term system maintenance and redesign, and settings in
the developing world.

We encourage the participation of all those interested in learning
about participatory design and in trying it in their own settings, as
well as those currently employing participatory approaches to design
(possibly under other names). 
==================================================================

Artifacts submissions
(including posters and demonstrations)

The Artifacts program brings together representations, techniques,
methodologies and technologies developed for or through participatory
design. (A representation may take the form of documents and other
objects that reflect work practices, designs, and associated materials,
and should include both the artifact itself and how it is used in the
work situation.)

A contribution to the Artifacts program should be intended to be shown
or demonstrated informally at a booth. The Artifacts program will take
place in conjunction with the conference dinner and thus will not
overlap with the papers/panels/workshops tracks.

Submission Requirements:
Description and motivation of the artifact and how it is used in
practice (5 copies, maximum 3 pages). Include non-textual materials
like photographs, videotapes, sketches, etc., if appropriate (only one
copy of a videotape is required, and photographs may be provided in
photocopied form). Be sure to describe any plans to engage conference
participants directly in using the artifact.
Brief description of artifact presenter's relevant experience and
background.
Any special equipment or power requirements.
