Dimmer is a VGA screen saver that supports two methods of screen saving:
disabling video and dimming. It works in all video modes (including
graphic ones).

WARNING: When selected method is dimming, Dimmer doesn't remove keystroke
    from keyboard buffer.

Command line parameters

    Install         :  Dimmer i{I} [minutes]
    Uninstall       :  Dimmer r
    Change settings :  Dimmer p{P} [minutes]

    [minutes] - time interval of keyboard and mouse inactivity
                before screen is dimmed (or blanked),
                if zero, then Dimmer is disabled.
    i, p      - small letter means use dimming as the screen saving method.
    I, P      - capital letter means use enable/disable video as the screen
                saving method.

If you include Dimmer installation in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, be sure
to install Dimmer AFTER mouse driver has been loaded, or else Dimmer won't
recognize you have a mouse.

Mouse positions convention

    Moving mouse pointer (possibly invisible) to the upper right corner of
    the screen forces immediate start of Dimmer operation.
    Moving mouse pointer (possibly invisible) to the lower right corner of
    the screen prevents Dimmer from starting up.

Dimmer API

    An application program can modify Dimmer parameters through Multiplex
    interrupt (Int 2Fh) subfunction ah = 64h.

    Installation check
    al = 0
        Return
        al = 0FFh if installed

    Dim now
    al = 1
    (would fail if mouse pointer was at the lower right corner of the screen)

    Change screen blank delay
    al = 2
    bl = time in minutes (0 = off)

    Screen saving method
    al = 3
    bl = 0 -- enable/disable video
    bl = 1 -- dimming

    Get parameters
    al = 4
        Return
        al = delay
        bl = method (as in al = 3 subfunction)
