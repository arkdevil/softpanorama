RUCKUS 1.0d for DOS C compilers.

INSTALL:
-------
First thing to do is to move all the files in this package to a new directory
with at least a 1.5M available. You can move them anytime after the
installation has finished. To install, run INSTALL.BAT. INSTALL.BAT executes
the INSTALLATION program to setup the library files. These programs extract
and build the two LIBrary files, RUCKDAC.LIB and RUCKMIDI.LIB, ready to be
used by any DOS C compiler (see the Borland patch below).


USING A BORLAND C COMPILER:
---------------------------
If you are using any of Borland's C compilers (TC 1.0 to BC 3.1+) you must
use the BORLAND patch. See the files in BORLAND.ZIP for more.


OLDER COMPILERS:
---------------
If you're using QuickC you should not use the AtExit() routines provided with
RUCKUS. Seems _atexit is always near in all QC 2.5 memory models (a QC bug).
This may be a local problem.


WHAT ELSE?
----------
For a quick demo of the RUCKUS toolkit, run both CHIMPS1 (MIDI interactive
playback sequencer) and MODAC (Mod and DAC player/recorder). Also see the
GUS & OPL2/3 demo file (MIDIM020.ZIP) in R2_DEMOS.ZIP.

Read the *.DOC files for more.

VGA graphics and a mouse is recommended for CHIMPS1 and MODAC110. For
CHIMPS1.EXE information run CHIMPS1 with nothing following. For MODAC
information see the MODAC.DOC file.


AND STILL:
---------
The XMS file transfer buffer is now 16K rather than 64K since C's malloc()
large model cannot deal with requests of 64K. Probably just as well.


Credit card order now accepted. See !ORDER.CC.
