AdLib 2-op IBK -> RUCKUS MIDI patch map
IBK2RUCK.BAS (C)1993 Cornel Huth

This program converts a .IBK instrument bank format for 2-op AdLib
devices used by Cakewalk into a assembly-language file that is to
be assembled for use with RUCKUS-MIDI.

Just run the program and follow the prompts. The resultant output
does require a suitable assembler. Any assembler should do.

This program is needed only by those that want to build there own patch
library. For a good IBK editing program, look for the shareware program
SBKTimbre by Jamie O'Connell (SBTMB252.ZIP on the Fortieth Floor). This
program generates IBK files that IBK2RUCK uses.
