This is GNU find.  It complies with POSIX 1003.2 draft 9, as far as I
know; it also supports some additional predicates, some borrowed
from Unix and some unique to the GNU version.  See the comment near
the top of find.c for a syntax summary.

Being distributed along with it is James Woods' public domain
fast-find code, which is also distributed with the 4.3BSD find.
Because POSIX requires `find foo' to have the same effect as `find foo
-print', the fast-find searching has been moved to a separate program,
`fastfind'.  If you want to use fastfind, you should run the included
`updatedb' script from cron periodically (typically nightly).

Suggestions and bug reports for GNU find should be mailed to
bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu.
