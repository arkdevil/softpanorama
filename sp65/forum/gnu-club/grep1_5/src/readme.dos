# readme. - GNUish MS-DOS e?grep			-*-Text-*-

To recompile e?grep for MS-DOS, you will also need the gnulib (obtainable
from the same place where you picked up this file).  In particular the
regexp library distributed with the original GNU e?grep is fairly outdated
and should be replaced by the one in gnulib.

The other changes are fairly trivial.
