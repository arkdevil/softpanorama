          ACMBUL's 1st INTERNATIONAL COMPUTER VIRUS PROBLEMS AND
                          ALTERNATIVES CONFERENCE

                   April, 1993     -     Varna, Bulgaria

The purpose of the 1993 International Computer Virus Conference is to
provide a forum for anti-virus product developers, researchers and
academicians to exchange information among themselves, the students,
the public and the industry. ICVC'93 will consist of open forums,
distinguished keynote speakers, and the presentation of high-quality
accepted papers. A high degree of interaction and discussion among
Conference participants is expected, as a workshop-like setting is
promoted.

Because ICVC'93 is a not-for-profit activity funded primarily by
registration fees, all participants are expected to have their
organizations bear the costs of their expenses and registration.
Accommodations will be available at reduced rates for conference
participants.

advisors, EDP auditors, network administrators, and help desk personnel
