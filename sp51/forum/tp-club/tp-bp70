                       Borland Pascal with Objects 7.0
                             Questions & Answers
   1. What are the new features of Borland Pascal with Objects
      7.0?
      Borland Pascal with Objects 7.0 includes all of the
      features necessary for high productivity application
      development for DOS and Windows.
      The major new features are:
      o  Support for DOS, DOS Protected Mode (DPMI) and Windows
         programming
      o  Ability to create DOS Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) that
         are binary compatible with Windows
      o  High capacity DOS and Windows IDEs
      o  Improved IDEs with color syntax highlighting and
         undo/redo
      o  DOS and Windows ObjectBrowsers for navigating source
         code
      o  New compiler optimizations and language features
      o  Extended DOS and Windows application frameworks
      o  Over 3,800 pages of documentation with many new
         tutorials
      o  Over 4 megabytes of on-line help including the Windows
         API
   2. What are the new features of Turbo Pascal 7.0?
      Turbo Pascal 7.0 includes features that make it the best
      way to learn object-oriented programming.  The major new
      features of Turbo Pascal 7.0 are:
      o  High capacity DOS Integrated Development Environment
         (IDE)
      o  Improved IDE with color syntax highlighting and
         undo/redo
      o  ObjectBrowser for navigating source code
      o  Additional Turbo Vision objects
      o  1,500 pages of documentation with several new tutorials
      o  1 megabyte of on-line help with copy-and-paste examples
   3. What's the difference between Borland Pascal with Objects
      7.0 and Turbo Pascal 7.0?
      Borland Pascal with Objects 7.0 includes features aimed at
      professional DOS and Windows programmers including the
      ability to create DOS Protected Mode (DPMI) applications,
      DOS Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs), as well as a more
      complete set of professional tools including Turbo
      Debugger, Turbo Profiler, Turbo Assembler.
      Turbo Pascal 7.0 is a subset of Borland Pascal with Objects
      and includes the ability to create DOS real mode programs.
      It includes the high capacity IDE, ObjectBrowser and
      extended Turbo Vision application framework, but does not
      support DOS Protected Mode (DPMI) or Windows development.
   8. What are the benefits of creating DPMI applications?
      By using Borland Pascal with Objects 7.0 you can create DOS
      Protected Mode (DPMI) applications that break through the
      640K barrier and access up to 16 megabytes of memory for
      code and data.  This gives you higher capacity for dealing
      with larger amounts of data for more efficient processing.
   19.What is the minimum hardware configurations for Borland
      Pascal with Objects 7.0 and Turbo Pascal 7.0?
      Borland Pascal with Objects 7.0 requires an 80286 or higher
      processor, 2 megabytes of memory, a hard disk.  For Windows
      development you must also have Windows 3.0 or later,
      graphics (EGA, Hercules, VGA or higher resolution) and a
      mouse.
      Turbo Pascal 7.0 requires 720K of disk space and 512K of
      memory.  A hard disk and 80286 or higher processor is
      required to use the high-capacity IDE.

      Both products will ship November 2, 1992.
