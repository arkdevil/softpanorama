+                           Command line mode

                        The command-line options

F-PROT.EXE is usually run without any parameters and will then enter
interactive mode.  It is also possible to run it in command-line mode,
which was the only possibility with version 1.

The available command-line options are

/ALL
Specifies that all files should be searched, not just normal "executable"
files.

/ANALYSE
Performs a heuristic analysis instead of a signature-based scan. This
approach may cause false positives, and should be used with care.

/APPEND
Used with /REPORT. Append the report to an existing file.

/AUTO
May be specified with /DELETE or /DISINF so F-PROT will not request
permission before deleting or disinfecting.  The default if only /DELETE
or /DISINF are given is to ask if the file should be disinfected (or
deleted).

/BOOT (default) /NOBOOT
Scan/Don't scan for boot sector viruses

/COMMAND
Force command-line mode.

/DELETE
Delete all infected files, instead of just listing them.

/DISINF
Disinfect whenever possible - deletes first-generation samples and files
destroyed by overwriting viruses.  It will never delete a file which can
be disinfected.

/FILE (default) /NOFILE
Scan/Don't scan for file viruses

/HARD
Scans the entire hard disk.

/HELP or /?
Display a list of available options.

/INTER
Force interactive mode.

/LIST
Produce a report of all files checked, not just those which are infected.

/MULTI
Scan multiple diskettes.

/NET
Scans any network "drives" found.

/NOBREAK
Disables ESC during scanning

/NOMEM
Skip the memory scan.

/NOWRAP
Do not wrap text in the report.

/OLD
Do not display the "This version of the program is rather old" message.

/PACKED (default) /NOPACKED
Search/Don't search inside packed files.

/QUICK
Faster search, but not as accurate.

/RENAME
Rename infected files to *.VOM or *.VXE.

/REPORT=file
Sends the output to a file, in addition to displaying it on the screen.

/SILENT
Generates no screen output at all - useful if you want to run the program
from a batch file, and only check the return code.

/TROJAN (default) /NOTROJAN
Search/Don't search for some Trojans and joke programs as well as viruses.

/USER /NOUSER (default)
Search/Don't search for user-defined virus patterns.  This option should
only be used if absolutely neccessary, as it may result in a considerable
speed decrease.

                          Return status

The program uses the following exit codes, which can be checked with the
ERRORLEVEL command from a BAT file.

    0 - Normal exit nothing found
    1 - Abnormal termination - unrecoverable error (usually a missing
        system file)
    2 - Selftest failed - program has been modified.
    3 - A Boot/File virus infection found.
    4 - Virus signatures found in memory.
    5 - Program terminated with ^C.
    6 - At least one virus was removed.  This code is only meaningful if
        the program is used to scan just a single file.
