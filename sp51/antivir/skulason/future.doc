                           Improvements

The F-PROT anti-virus program is not static - it is expected to change
quite a bit in the near future.  Some of the planned improvements are:

	* Context-sensitive help - Press F1 anywhere and get help.

 	* Windows version - the current version runs under Windows 3.0,
     	  but it is not a Windows application.  A Windows version of
 	  F-PROT and VIRSTOP is planned.

	* EMS-using version of VIRSTOP.EXE, which would keep the use of
 	  conventional memory below 2K.

Other features may be added if there is enough demand:

	* Mouse support.

        * Improving VIRSTOP.EXE, so it can check files when they are
	  copied and also check diskettes when they are accessed.

Any other suggestions for improvements are appreciated.
