
			F-PROT 2 introduction

F-PROT 2 is an anti-virus program - similar to version 1, yet fundamentally
different.  The earlier version could best be classified as a collection of
various anti-virus utilities, often with overlapping functions.

In version 2 many of the programs have been combined into one, and the
user-interface has been totally redesigned.  Instead of having to specify
various command-line options, the user is now presented with a menu-driven
interface.  Anyone who prefers to use command-line options can still do so,
however - see COMMAND.DOC for details.

The package consists of several files, which are:

	VIRSTOP.EXE   the virus-intercepting program.
	F-PROT.EXE    the main program
	SIGN.DEF      virus signatures
        *.TX0         language files for various languages
        VIR-HELP.*    virus information in various languages
        *.DOC         information about viruses and the package

The function of VIRSTOP.EXE is to intercept known viruses - it will
prevent the execution of any program infected with any of the viruses
it recognizes. See VIRSTOP.DOC for a description of this program.

The other program provides virus scanning, disinfection and information. 
To run it, just give the command

			F-PROT <enter>

If F-PROT.EXE is run from a diskette it might appear rather slow, but then
it is safe from being infected by a virus - provided the diskette is write-
protected, of course.

F-PROT first performs a self-test, to see if it has been infected with a
virus, and then it loads the virus signatures into memory.  The next step
is to search for viruses in memory, but this can be disabled with the
/NOMEM command-line switch.

You will then be greeted by a screen which shows the available functions:

			Scan
			Install
			Viruses
			Program
                	Quit

As a detailed description of some of the functions is provided in separate
.DOC files, they are only described briefly here.

Scan (see SCAN.DOC): Searches for viruses, using a large (and growing) set
of virus signatures.  The user can select where to search, and choose
between three different search modes.

Install (see INSTALL.DOC):  When this option is selected, a new menu will
appear where it is possible to select which language to use.  It also
provides some configuration of the program, as well as installation of
VIRSTOP.EXE. 

Viruses: When this function is selected, a new menu appears with a couple
of virus-related functions.  One is 'Information', which provides information
on viruses - a description of their size, behaviour, origin and other
facts which may be of interest.  The second option allows the user to enter
a search pattern for a new virus.  This should only be necessary between
the discovery of a totally new virus and the arrival of an updated version
of F-PROT.
	
Program: Answers to some common questions, such as how to obtain updates
and how to contact the author.  Also an attempt to answer the persistent
question of how many viruses F-PROT will detect.

Quit: Exit from the program
