                Known problems with F-PROT

The following compatibility problems are known at the moment, and will be
fixed as soon as possible.

VIRSTOP.EXE is not effective if run before a program which totally takes
over the "Load-and-Execute" function.  This includes Novell Netware and
PC-NFS, and as explained elsewhere, VIRSTOP should be run after those
programs.  However, this also applies to DesqView - which means that
VIRSTOP is not effective inside a DOS window in DesqView.

Occasionally, when using Novell Netware with VIRSTOP installed, and an
attempt is made to send anything to a Laser printer over the network, from
inside Excel or Word, the output may become garbled.  The reason for this
is not known, but a few other TSR's are known to cause the same problem,
so this may not be a F-PROT problem.  This is usually solved by using
LPT1.OS2 instead of LPT1 as the printer port.

VIRSTOP and PC Tools MIRROR are not happy to coexist together - at least
it depends on which one is run first. (I have not been able to reproduce
this problem with version 2.02, but I did nothing special to fix it, so
maybe it is gone...)

The following problem is not likely to go away in the near future:

F-PROT cannot be used on a single-floppy machine without a hard disk
or network connections. This is because if the F-PROT is run from a
diskette, the diskette may not be removed while the program is running, so
other diskettes cannot be inserted for scanning.
