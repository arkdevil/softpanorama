                          Installation 

Installation of F-PROT is fairly simple, and can either be done manually
or semi-automatically.

Manual installation involves copying all the files which make up the
package to a separate directory on the hard disk or on a network server.
One line is then added to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to load the VIRSTOP.EXE
program.  It is assumed that anyone installing the program manually knows
how to create directories and use a text editor, so this will not be
explained here.

The semi-automatic installation assumes that F-PROT is present on a diskette,
and the intention is to install it on the hard disk.  To install, you run
the program and select the "Install" function from the initial menu.

You will then be presented with a menu offering four choices:

  			      Language

The program is available in several different languages, with more on the
way.  When F-PROT.EXE is run it searches for *.TX0 and VIR-HELP.* files,
which contain all the necessary texts in each language.  If your version
has multiple such files, the "Language" option can be used to specify which
language to use.  This information will be stored in the SETUP.F2 file. 
See the file LANGUAGE.DOC for further information on the various languages.

The default language depends on the country information returned by DOS -
for example if both the English and German language files are provided,
but the current country is Austria, the German language would be used by
default.  You should select the correct language, before installing
VIRSTOP.EXE, so the correct version of VIRSTOP.EXE will be created.

			   	Setup

This option is intended to tailor the program to specific tastes.  In
future versions it might allow the user to change the color of the screen,
and make other similar changes, but currently it is only used to select if
the list of viruses should be displayed line-by-line or column-by-column.

			     Install

Selecting this options has two effects.  The package will be copied to the
hard disk, unless it is already there.  VIRSTOP.EXE will be modified, so
that it contains the correct texts for the current language.

			     VIRSTOP.EXE

The operation of this program (the resident part of F-PROT) is described
in the VIRSTOP.DOC file. Selecting this option on a stand-alone machine
has the effect of adding one line at the beginning of AUTOEXEC.BAT.  By
default, this line is

                            C:\F-PROT\VIRSTOP

If the package had just been installed on a different directory it will be
used instead.

Installation on networked machines is more complicated, and cannot (yet)
be done automatically. VIRSTOP.EXE must be loaded after the network
software, and generally a single copy would be installed on a server, so
that every single machine does not need to be updated when a new version
of F-PROT is available.

Starting with version 2.01 the VIRSTOP program can also be loaded from
CONFIG.SYS, as a device driver.  To do that you need to place a command like
the following in the CONFIG.SYS file.

                 DEVICE=C:\F-PROT\VIRSTOP.EXE

or, if you are using DOS 5, you may use:

                 DEVICEHIGH=C:\F-PROT\VIRSTOP.EXE

However, as mentioned above - if you are using certain types of network
software, such as PC-NFS or Novell Netware, you MUST load the program from
AUTOEXEC.BAT, after the network software is loaded.
