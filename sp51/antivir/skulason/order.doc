                               PRIVATE USE

The English-language shareware version of the F-PROT anti-virus program is
free of charge for any individual using it on his/her personally owned
computer, which is not used for a commercial purposes.

Updates to the program may be obtained from BBSes, via FTP or directly from

from FSI is US$20. Regular, bimonthly updates by mail are available for
US$100 per year. 

                              SITE LICENSES

The cost for a site license depends on the estimated number of computers in
the company or department covered by the license. There is a minimum fee of
US$20 per year.

                21 - 2500     $1.00 per computer
              2501 - 5000     $0.75 per computer
              5001 - 7500     $0.50 per computer
              7501 - 10000    $0.25 per computer
             10001 and up     call for information

Example: A license for 4500 computers would be

                2500 computers at $1.00   $2500
                2000 computers at $0.75   $1500
                                         
         which gives a total of $4000 per year

The customer is not expected to keep accurate count of the number of computers
which the software is installed on, only to provide a reasonable estimate.

If you just order a site license, we assume that you already have the
program, and that you will be obtaining new versions of the program by FTP
or download them from bulletin boards.  In this case, all you receive from
us is just an invoice and a paper copy of the license, if requested.  If
you need a diskette with the latest version, please add $20 (or $100 for a
1-year subscription).

                            EDUCATIONAL DISCOUNT

There is a 25% educational discount of the license fee, although the $20
minimum fee still applies.  There is no charge for the use of the program
on computers personally owned by students/staff.

                             SERVICE LICENCE

Large companies and organizations that do not want to install the F-PROT
software on all computers, only make it available to a few technicians
can get a service license for a fixed annual fee of US$500.  This includes
permission to install the program on no more than 50 (fifty) computers,
but the program may be used temporarily on other computers, to perform
periodic checks and to remove any viruses found.  

                             OBTAINING UPDATES

There is no additional fee for updates if they are obtained from BBSes,
from CompuServe, or via FTP from one of the Internet archive servers, such
as eugene.utmb.edu or oak.oakland.edu.

If you cannot use any of those options, we offer a bimonthly mail-update
service, for a fixed annual fee of US$100.
