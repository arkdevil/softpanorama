			   Different languages

The F-PROT anti-virus program is available in several different languages
in different countries.  In some cases the versions are shareware just
like the original English version, but in other cases they are distributed
as normal commercial products.

The native-language commercial programs are more expensive than the
shareware versions, but this is because users in those countries get more -
a printed manual and a higher level of support.  These versions are
primarily targeted towards commercial users and there will be no attempts
to limit the distribution of the shareware versions for private use in the
countries involved.  Commercial users in those countries are however asked
to contact the distributors of the program in their country, in order to
obtain a localized version.

Distributors of the localized versions are:
