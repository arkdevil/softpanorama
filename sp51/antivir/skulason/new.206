Version 2.06 - major changes:

   No major changes this time...sorry, folks...

Version 2.06 - the following problems were found and corrected.

   Some false positives have been fixed, for example if BACKUP.EXE was
   compressed with PKLITE, F-PROT 2.05 would report the "Stanco" virus.

   Joke programs, such as BUGSRES.COM no longer increase the "Infected"
   counter.

   Version 2.05 did not display the "Scanning memory" box.

   Previous versions of the program were sometimes unable to remove the Form
   virus from hard disks.

Version 2.06 - minor improvements:

   The /RENAME command-line switch was added, but using it is equivalent
   to selecting "Action: Rename" in interactive mode.  It is also possible
   to use /AUTO together with /RENAME

   Identification of infected .SYS files has been improved - previously
   they were just reported as "New or modified variant of ...".

   The /NOWRAP switch can now be used with interactive mode, and the
   report scrolled horizontally.

   The /EXT= command-line switch was added to allow the user to determine
   which file extensions to search.

   VIRSTOP did not stop compressed viruses such as Cvirus or Stanco.  This
   has now been added.

   The report produced by F-PROT includes the volume label(s) of the
   disk(s) scanned.

   If the user presses ESC or Ctrl-C during scanning, the program will
   aks if it should stop scanning.

Version 2.06 - new viruses:

   The following 9 new viruses can now be detected but not removed,
   only deleted.  This is because they overwrite infected files, or
   damage them irreversibly.
