  >|
  >|       Robert Jung grew up in Catonsville, Maryland.  He graduated from
  >|       the University of Maryland in 1970.  After a short stint in the
  >|       U.S. Army, he taught chemistry for six years.  From teaching he
  >|       entered the computer programming profession where he was employed
  >|       as a programmer analyst, a network analyst, and a senior software
  >|       engineer.  In late 1990, he developed the ARJ archive format and
  >|       program to meet a personal need in archiving. In February of 1991,
  >|       he released ARJ 1.00 as a shareware product. The author currently
  >|       supports ARJ full-time and resides in Norwood, Massachusetts with
