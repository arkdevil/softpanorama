     This is a public BETA TEST version of ARJ.  You should ONLY use this
     version for TESTING purposes.  This version is NOT intended for new
     ARJ users.  Only experienced ARJ users should test this program.

     Please keep in mind that this is BETA TEST version and may have
     serious bugs.  You should backup your computer data before using this
     program and should do so often while using this program.

     The most important feature to test is the new compression and
     extraction functions.  Another feature to test is the new yes/no
     prompt features.
