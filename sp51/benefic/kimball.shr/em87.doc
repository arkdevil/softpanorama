			EM87 V1.4	6/9/90
			=========

	This program fully emulates the 8087 math coprocessor on 80286 
and 80386 based computers. This is useful to run software that requires
the 8087/80287/80287. This program does not emulate the 80287/80387
extensions to the 8087 instruction set, but most software I have seen
only uses the 8087 instructions to be PC/XT compatible. Please note that
floating point emulation is MUCH slower than the real thing (but also 
much cheaper!).
	Unfortunately, this method of emulation does not work on the 8088
and 8086 based computers because these processors do not have emulation
support built in.

History:
========

	Version 1.1 fixes problems with programs that access extended memory,
like VDISK.SYS, RAMDRIVE.SYS, SMARTDRV.SYS, AUTOCAD, etc. Also this version
will not load if a real 80X87 is present.

	Version 1.2 fixes problems uninstalling EM87 under certain versions of
DOS. Also display of the help screen would lock up some machines.

	Version 1.3 allows floating point exception interrupts to properly 
cause a non-maskable interrupt when enabled. Very few programs use this feature.
The lack of this capability caused programs that needed it to do strange things
to the video display.

NEW!
====
	Version 1.4 will not attempt to load on a 8088/8086/V20 processor
machine. Note that the program has been changed from a .COM to a .EXE file. You
must delete the old program. Copying the new program will not overwrite the old
one! EM87 is now compatible with 80386 memory managers, see section below.

If you are using a 80386 memory manager:
========================================
	To load EM87 on an 80386 machine with a memory manager loaded (such as
QEMM, 386MAX, EMM386.SYS) you MUST place the device driver, EM87.SYS, in your
CONFIG.SYS by putting the line:
	DEVICE=EM87.SYS
as the FIRST line in your CONFIG.SYS. This line MUST be before the line that
installs the memory manager! You must also place the line:
	EM87 /L
in your AUTOEXEC.BAT. If EM87.EXE is not loaded after EM87.SYS and before ANY
program that checks for or uses the numerics coprocessor, your system WILL
crash! EM87 can not be unloaded if you are using a 80386 memory manager. It can
be loaded into high memory if your memory manager has the capability to load
programs in high memory. Do not load EM87.SYS into high memory, as it does not
remain resident anyways.

Do NOT use EM87.SYS if you are not running a 80386 memory manager! 
==================================================================

Tested with:
============

	AUTOCAD release 9.
	AUTOCAD release 10.
	Microway's 87TEST v1.20 (A very intensive 8087 test program).
	FATMAN30 (A great mandelbrot generator!).
	NORTON UTILITIES 4.5 SI (Reports a 8087 present).
	PC-Matlab
	Simnon

Does not work with:
===================

	AUTOCAD 386.
	Possibly any other program that uses a DOS extender (286 or 386
		protected mode).
	Probably only works with WINDOWS 3.0 in real mode.

Usage:
======
	EM87		>Display the help screen.
	EM87 /L		>Load the emulator.
	EM87 /U		>Unload the emulator.

EM87 returns the error codes as shown in the section below to MSDOS.
