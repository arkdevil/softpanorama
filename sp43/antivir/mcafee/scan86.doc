SYNOPSIS

     VIRUSCAN (SCAN) is a virus detection and identification
program for the IBM PC and compatible computers.  VIRUSCAN will
search a PC for known computer viruses in memory, the boot sector,
the partition table, and the files of a PC and its disks.  VIRUSCAN
can also detect the presence of unknown viruses.
     SCAN works by searching the system for instruction sequences
unique to each computer virus, and then reporting their presence
when found.  This method works for viruses that VIRUSCAN recognizes.
SCAN can detect unknown viruses in files and boot sector by appending
validation (CRC) codes to .COM and .EXE files and then checking the files
against their codes for changes, warning that an infection may have
occurred if the file has been modified in any way.  An enhanced validation
mode is available that will save and check information that can be used by
CLEAN-UP to restore infected files, the partition table, or the boot sector
of a disk in case of an infection by an unknown virus.  SCAN can also check
for new viruses from a user-supplied list of virus search strings.
     VIRUSCAN runs on any PC with 256Kb and DOS version 2.00 or above.


AUTHENTICITY

     VIRUSCAN runs a self-test when executed.  If SCAN has been
modified in any way, a warning will be displayed.  The program will
still continue to check for viruses.  If SCAN reports that it
has been damaged, it is recommended that a clean copy be obtained.
     VIRUSCAN versions 46 and above are packaged with the VALIDATE
program to ensure the integrity of the SCAN.EXE file.  The
VALIDATE.DOC  instructions tell how to use the VALIDATE program.
The VALIDATE program distributed with VIRUSCAN may be used to check
all further versions of SCAN.

     The validation results for Version 8.3V86 should be:

	      FILE NAME: SCAN.EXE
		   SIZE: 65,934
		   DATE: 1-24-1992
    FILE AUTHENTICATION
	 Check Method 1: A697
	 Check Method 2: 07FF

If your copy of SCAN.EXE differs, it may have been modified.
Always obtain your copy of VIRUSCAN from a known source.  The
latest version of VIRUSCAN and validation data for SCAN.EXE can be
obtained off of McAfee Associates' bulletin board system at (408)
988-4004 or from the Computer Virus Help Forum on CompuServe.

     Beginning with Version 72, all McAfee Associates programs for
download are archived with PKWare's PKZIP Authentic File Verification.
If you do not see the "-AV" message after every file is unzipped and
receive the message "Authentic Files Verified! # NWN405  Zip Source:
McAFEE ASSOCIATES" when you unzip the files then do not run them.  If
your version of PKUNZIP does not have verification ability, then this
message may not be displayed.  Please contact McAfee Associates if
your .ZIP file has been tampered with.

WHAT'S NEW
    
     Three new options have been added to this release of VIRUSCAN to allow
it to save and check information that can be used by CLEAN-UP to recover
infected files, partition tables, or boot sectors infected with unknown
viruses.  When SCAN is run with the /AG option it will add validation codes
to .COM and .EXE files like the /AV option, but will also store information
about the file that can be used by CLEAN-UP to reconstruct it if infected by
a virus.  It will add 52 bytes to COM and EXE files.  SCAN will also store
copies of the partition table and boot sector in the hidden SCANVAL.VAL file
created on the root directory of the bootable harddisk.  The /CG option will
check this recovery information to determine whether an infection has
occurred, and the /RG option will remove this recovery information from the
system.
     Additionally, a /NOEXPIRE option has been added to prevent display of
the SCAN expiration notice when SCAN is more than seven months old.  
     Of particular interest in this release is the Pogue virus.  This virus
uses a new and difficult-to-detect self-mutating engine employing a very
sophisticated variable encryption technique loosely based on one developed
by the author of Dark Avenger virus and contains code similar to that found
in other Bulgarian viruses.  The virus was uploaded anonymously to our BBS
so it is not clear as to whether it is from Eastern Europe or the USA.  It
also unknown if the virus is widespread or not.
     For a listing of the viruses that were added, please refer to
the enclosed VIRLIST.TXT file for a short description.  For a more
complete description, please refer to Patricia Hoffman's VSUM listing.

OVERVIEW

     VIRUSCAN scans diskettes or entire systems for pre-existing
computer virus infections.  It will identify the virus infecting
the system, and tell what area of the system (memory, boot sector,
file) the virus occupies.  Infected files can be removed with
the overwrite-and-delete option, /D, which will erase the file.
The CLEAN-UP program is also available to disinfect the system and
repair damaged areas of the system whenever possible.
     VIRUSCAN Version 86 identifies all known computer viruses
along with their variants.  Some viruses have been modified so that
more than one "strain" exists.  Counting such modifications, there
are 1,199 virus variants.  This includes the twenty most common viruses
which account for over 98% of all reported PC infections.  The
accompanying VIRLIST.TXT file lists describes all viruses identified
by SCAN.  The number of variants of each virus is listed in parentheses
after the virus name.
     All known computer viruses infect one or more of the following
areas:  the hard or fixed disk partition table (also known as the master
boot record); the boot sector of hard disks and floppy disks; or one or
more executable files within the system.  Executable files include
operating system files, .COM files, .EXE files, overlay files, or any
other files containing program code.  A virus that infects more than one
area, such as a boot sector and an executable file is called a multipartite
virus.
     VIRUSCAN identifies every system area or file infected, and
indicates both the virus name and CLEAN-UP I.D. code used to remove it.
SCAN will check the entire system, an individual diskette, subdirectory,
subdirectory tree or individual files for pre-existing virus infection.
     VIRUSCAN can also check files for unknown viruses with the Add
Validation and Check Validation options.  This is done by calculating a
checksum for files, appending it to the end of the file, and then
comparing the file against it.  If the file has been modified, the check
will no longer match, indicating that viral infection may have occurred.
When run in the enhanced mode, the validation codes will save information
that can be used to restore files or areas of the system that have been
damaged by an unknown virus.
     VIRUSCAN calculates checksums using two independently-generated CRC
(Cyclic Redundancy Check).  Files which are self-checking or self-modifying
should not be validated since this will set off their own internal checks.
VIRUSCAN adds validation codes to .COM and .EXE files only.  The validation
codes for the partition table, boot sector, and system files, are kept in a
hidden file called SCANVAL.VAL in the root directory.  To detect boot sector
and partition table (MBR) viruses, SCAN checks the boot sector and MBR for
signs of viral code.  If suspicious code is found, SCAN will report it has
found a Generic Boot Boot Sector or MBR Virus.
VIRUSCAN Version 8.3V86                                Page 5


     VIRUSCAN can also be updated to search for new viruses via
an External Virus Data File option, which allows the user to
provide the VIRUSCAN program with new search strings for viruses.
     VIRUSCAN can display messages in English, French, or Spanish.
     VIRUSCAN works on stand-alone and networked PC's, but not on
a file server.  For networks, use the NETSCAN file server scanner
instead.
     An aging notice is built into the SCAN program.  When the program 
is more than seven months old, a notice will be displayed to the user 
that SCAN may be out of date.  SCAN will continue to function normally,
however.  The aging notice can be bypassed by using the /NOEXPIRE switch.


OPERATION

IMPORTANT NOTE:  WRITE PROTECT YOUR FLOPPY DISK BEFORE SCANNING
YOUR SYSTEM TO PREVENT INFECTION OF THE VIRUSCAN PROGRAM.

     VIRUSCAN will check each area or file on the designated
drive(s) that could be host to a virus.  If a virus is found, a
message is displayed telling the name of the infected file or
system area and the name of the identified virus.  SCAN will
examine files for viruses based on their extensions.  The default
file extensions supported by SCAN are .APP, .BIN, .COM, .EXE, .OV?,
.PGM, .PIF, .PRG, .SWP, .SYS, and .XTP.  Additional extensions can
be added to SCAN or all files on disk can be selected for scanning.

     To run VIRUSCAN type:

SCAN d1: ... d26: /? /A /AG filename /AV filename /BELL /CERTIFY /CHKHI /CG
		  /CV /D /DATE /E .xxx .yyy .zzz /EXT filename /FAST
		  /FR /H /HELP /MAINT /MANY /NLZ /NOBREAK / NOEXPIRE /NOMEM
		  /NOPAUSE /NPKL /REPORT filename /RG /RV /SHOWDATE

VIRUSCAN Version 8.3V86                                Page 6


	    /NLZ - Skip internal scan of LZEXE compressed files
	/NOBREAK - Disable Ctrl-C / Ctrl-Brk during scanning
       /NOEXPIRE - Do not display expiration notice
	  /NOMEM - Skip memory checking
	/NOPAUSE - Disable screen pause when scanning
	   /NPKL - Skip internal scan of PKLITE compressed files
/REPORT filename - Create report of infected files
	     /RG - Remove recovery data/validation codes from files
	     /RV - Remove validation codes from specified files
       /SHOWDATE - Display date and time VIRUSCAN was last run
	     /SP - Display messages in Spanish
	    /SUB - Scan subdirectories
       @filename - Scan using options from configuration file
  (d1: ... d26: indicate drives to be scanned)


     The /A option will cause SCAN to check all files on the
referenced drive.  This should only be used if a file-infecting
virus has already been detected.  Otherwise the /A option should
only be used when checking a new program.  The /A option will add
a substantial time to scanning.  This option takes priority over
the /E option.
     The /AG option allows the user to store recovery data and
validation codes for .COM and, .EXE, files the boot sector, and
partition table of a disk.  Recovery information adds fifty-two
(52) bytes to files.  The recovery information for the partition
table and boot sector is stored seperately in a hidden file in the
root directory.  It is otherwise similar to the /AV option below.
Recovery requires the CLEAN-UP (CLEAN.EXE) program.
     The /AV option allows the user to add validation codes to the
files being scanned.  If a full drive is specified, SCAN will
create validation data for the partition table, boot sector, and
system files of the disk as well.  Validation adds ten (10) bytes
to files; the validation data for the partition table, boot sector,
and system files is stored separately in a hidden file in the root
directory of the scanned drive.  Files which are already immunized
against computer viruses or contain self-modifying code should not
have validation codes added to them.  To prevent VIRUSCAN from adding
validation codes to these files, a validation exception list will have
to be created with the complete path and filename of the each file NOT
to be validated listed on each line.  Only one file should be on a line.
To put a comment in, start a line with the asterisk "*" character.  This
sample file contains a list of programs not to validate:

*This is MS-DOS 5.00's self-modifying program, SETVER
C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
*PKWare's data compression programs already perform a self-check
C:\PKWARE\PKLITE.EXE
C:\PKWARE\PKZIP.EXE
C:\PKWARE\PKUNZIP.EXE
*Stac Technologies hard disk swapping program
C:\SWAPVOL.COM
*Symantec's Norton Utilities V6.01 disk caching program
C:\NORTON\NCACHE.EXE
*WordStar
C:\WORDSTAR\WS.EXE

The validation exception list should be an ASCII text file.  If a word
processor is used to create the list, be sure to save the file as ASCII.
VIRUSCAN Version 8.3V86                                Page 7

     The /BELL option will cause VIRUSCAN to beep each time a computer
virus is found.
     The /CERTIFY option will audit a system for files that have
validation codes added to them with the /AV switch.  Files that have
no validation code will be reported as being uncertified by VIRUSCAN.
     The /CHKHI option checks the memory above 640Kb that can be
used on AT (286) and 386 systems for computer viruses.  This
includes the 384Kb Upper Memory Area from 640Kb to 1024Kb, and
the 64Kb High Memory Area from 1024Kb to 1088Kb.  On XT systems with
extended memory cards installed, this will cause the first 64K of
RAM to be scanned again.  This option can not be used with the
/NOMEM option.
     The /CG option checks restoration information and validation
codes inserted by the /AG option.  If the file or system area has been
changed, SCAN will report that the file has been modified.
     The /CV option checks validation codes inserted by the /AV
option.  If the file has been changed, SCAN will report that the
file has been modified, and that viral infection may have occurred.
Using the /CV option adds about 25% more time to scanning.

NOTE:  Some older Hewlett Packard and Zenith PC's modify the boot
sector or partition table each time the system is booted.  This
will cause SCAN to continually notify the user of boot sector or
partition table modifications if the /CV switch is selected.  Check
your system's manual to determine if your system contains
self-modifying boot code.

     The /D option tells VIRUSCAN to prompt the user to overwrite
and delete an infected file when one is found.  A file erased by the
/D option can not be recovered.  If the McAfee Associates' CLEAN-
UP program is available, it can be used to disinfect the file.
Boot sector and partition table infectors can not be removed by the /D
option and require the CLEAN-UP virus disinfection program.
     The /FAST option will speed VIRUSCAN up by displaying less
information on the screen during scanning, skipping scanning inside
of LZEXE- and PKLITE-compressed files, and examining a smaller
portion of files during scanning.  This may reduce the accuracy of SCAN.
     The /E option allows the user to specify an extension or set
of extensions to scan.  Extensions should include the period
character "." and be separated by a space after the /E and between
each other.  Up to three extensions may be added with the /E.  For
more extensions, use the /A option.
     The /EXT option allows VIRUSCAN to search for viruses from a
text file containing user-defined search strings in addition to the
viruses that already SCAN checks for.  The syntax for using the
external virus data file is /EXT d:filename, where d: is the drive
name and filename is the name of the external virus data file.  For
instructions on how to create an external virus data file, refer
to Appendix A.
VIRUSCAN Version 8.3V86                                Page 8


NOTE:  The /EXT option is intended for users to add strings for
       detection of computer viruses on an interim or emergency
       basis.  When used with the /D option, it will delete
       infected files. This option is not recommended for general
       use and should be used with caution.

     The /FR option tells VIRUSCAN to output all messages in French
instead of English.
     The /M option tells VIRUSCAN to check system memory for all
known computer viruses that can inhabit memory.  SCAN by default
only checks memory for critical and "stealth" viruses, which are
viruses which can cause catastrophic damage or spread the infection
during the scanning process.  SCAN will check memory for the
following viruses in any case:

     1024           1253          1554          1963
     1971           2560          337           3445-Stealth
     4096           512           Anthrax       Antitelefonica
     Brain          Caz           CD            Dark Avenger
     DIR-2          Doom II       Empire        Fish
     Flu-2          Form          Greemlin      Irish
     Joshi          Leech         Lozinsky      Microbes
     Mirror         Nomenklatura  NOP           No-Int (Stoned III)
     P1R (Phoenix)  Phantom       Plastique     Pogue
     SBC            Sentinel      Stoned        Sunday-2
     SVC            Taiwan3       Tequila       Turbo (Polish-2)
     Twin-351       V2100         V2P6          Whale

If one of these viruses is found in memory, SCAN will stop and
advise the user to power down, and reboot the system from a
virus-free system disk.  Using the /M option with another
anti-viral software package may result in false alarms if the other
package does not remove its virus search strings from memory.  The
/M option will add 6 to 20 seconds to the scanning time.
     The /MAINT option is used to scan hard disks partitioned with
DOS 4.0 or above that have been damaged by a boot sector or partition
table infecting virus.  Attempts to access disks damaged in such a
manner result in an "invalid media" message being displayed.  The
/MAINT option will only scan the partition table and boot sector,
not the files.
     The /MANY option is used to scan multiple diskettes placed in
a given drive.  If the user has more than one floppy disk to
check for viruses, the /MANY option will allows the user to check
them without having to run SCAN multiple times.  If a system has
been disinfected, the /MANY and /NOMEM options can be used to speed
up scanning of disks.
     The /NLZ option tells VIRUSCAN not to look inside files
compressed with the LZEXE file compression program.  SCAN will
still check the programs for external infections.
     The /NOBREAK option disables Control-C or Control-Break from
stopping VIRUSCAN while running. 
VIRUSCAN Version 8.3V86                                Page 9


     The /NOMEM option is used to turn off all memory checking for
viruses.  It should only be used when a system is known to be free
of viruses.  The /NOMEM option can not be used with the /CHKHI or /M
options.
     The /NOEXPIRE option disables the aging message that is displayed
when SCAN is more than seven months old.  
     The /NOPAUSE option disables the "More..." prompt that appears
when SCAN fills up a screen with data.  This allows VIRUSCAN to run
on a machine with multiple infections without requiring operator
intervention when the screen fills up with messages from the SCAN
program.
     The /NPKL option tells VIRUSCAN not to look inside files
compressed with the PKLITE file compression program.  SCAN will
still check the programs for external infections.
     The /REPORT option is used to generate a listing of infected
files.  The resulting list is saved to disk as an ASCII text file.
To use the report option, specify /REPORT on the command line,
followed by the device and filename [See EXAMPLES below for
samples].
     The /RG option will remove validation codes and recovery
information from files added with the /AG option.  
     The /RV option is used to remove validation codes from a file
or files.  It can be used to remove the validation code from a
diskette, subdirectory, or file(s).  Using /RV on a disk will
remove the partition table, boot sector, and system file
validation.  This option can not be used with the /AV option.
     The /SP option tells VIRUSCAN to output all messages in Spanish
instead of English.
     The /SUB option allows SCAN to scan subdirectories under a
a subdirectory when scanned.  Previously, SCAN would only
recursively check subdirectories if a logical device (e.g., C:)
was scanned.
     The @filename option allows the user to store a list of preferred
options and/or areas of the system to be scanned in a configuration file
and then have SCAN read the options in and execute them.  Options need
to be separated by a space, while system areas (a disk or subdirectory
or file) need to be on a separate line for each entry.  A sample file
might look like this:

/A /BELL /CV /NOMEM /REPORT C:\VIRUSCAN\SCAN.LOG
C:
D:\BBS
E:\MCAFEE\CLEAN-UP\CLEAN.EXE

The first line contains the VIRUSCAN options while the other lines
contain the name of files, subdirectories, or disks to be scanned
The configuration file should be an ASCII text file.  If a word
processor is used to create the list, be sure to save the file as ASCII.

EXIT CODES

     VIRUSCAN will set the DOS ERRORLEVEL upon program termination
to:

     ERRORLEVEL | DESCRIPTION
     -----------+--------------------------
	 0      | No viruses found
	 1      | One or more viruses found
	 2      | Abnormal termination (program error)

If a user stops the scanning process, SCAN will set the ERRORLEVEL
to 0 or 1 depending on whether or not a virus was discovered prior
to termination of the SCAN.  The /NOBREAK option can be used to
prevent scanning from being stopped.

APPENDIX A:  Creating a Virus String File with the /EXT Option

     The External Virus Data file should be created with an editor
or a word processor and saved as an ASCII text file.  Be sure each
line ends with a CR/LF pair.

NOTE:  The /EXT option is intended for emergency and research use
only.  It is an temporary method for identifying new viruses prior
to the subsequent release of SCAN.  A sound understanding of
viruses and string-search techniques is advised as a prerequisite
for using this option.

     The virus string file uses the following format:

#Comment about Virus_1
"aabbccddeeff..." Virus_1_Name
#Comment about Virus_2
"gghhiijjkkll..." Virus_2_Name
     .
     .
"uuvvwwxxyyzz..." Virus_n_Name


Where aa, bb, cc, etc. are the hexadecimal bytes that you wish to
scan for.  Each line in the file represents one virus.  The Virus
Name for each virus is mandatory, and may be up to 25 characters
in length.  The double quotes (") are required at the beginning and
end of each hexadecimal string.
     SCAN will use the string file to search memory, the Partition
Table, Boot Sector, System files, all .COM and .EXE files, and
Overlay files with the extension .BIN, .OV?, .PGM, .PIF, .PRG, .SYS
and .XTP.

     Virus strings may contain wild cards.  The two wildcard
options are:

FIXED POSITION WILDCARD
     The question mark "?" may be used to represent a wildcard in
a fixed position within the string.  For example, the string:

		   "E9 7C 00 10 ? 37 CB"

would match "E9 7C 00 10 27 37 CB", "E9 7C 00 10 9C 37 CB", or any
other similar string, no matter what byte was in the fifth place.

RANGE WILDCARD
     The asterisk "*", followed by range number in parentheses "("
and ")" is used to represent a variable number of adjoining random
bytes.  For example, the string:

		   "E9 7C *(4) 37 CB"

would match "E9 7C 00 37 CB", "E9 7C 00 11 37 CB", and
"E9 7C 00 11 22 37 CB".  The string "E9 7C 00 11 22 33 44 37 CB"
would not match since the distance between 7C and 37 is greater
than four bytes.  You may specify a range of up to 99 bytes.
Up to 10 different wildcards of either kind may be used in one
virus string.
VIRUSCAN Version 8.3V86                                Page 14
					     

COMMENTS
     A pound sign "#" at the begining of a line will denote that
it is a comment.  Use this for adding notes to the external virus
data file.  For example:

		   #New .COM virus found in file FRITZ.EXE from
		   #Schneiderland on 01-22-91
		   "53 48 45 45 50" Fritz-1 [F-1]

Could be used to store a description of the virus, name of the
original infected file, where and when it was received, and so
forth.


APPENDIX B:  Miscellaneous Application Notes


CHECKING MEMORY FOR VIRUS ONLY

     VIRUSCAN can perform a quick check of for viruses in memory only.
In this mode, the SCAN program will not check the disk for computer
viruses.  This option is useful for network administrators who need
to check workstations for viruses before allowing them to log on to a
LAN but can not run the VSHIELD program due to memory constraints.
The command to enter is:

     SCAN NUL /M /CHKHI

By designating NUL as the drive to be scanned, the SCAN program will
check system memory for viruses (up to 1088Kb if the /CHKHI option
is used) and then return to DOS without scanning any disks.  SCAN
will set the DOS ERRORLEVEL as it normally does.


VIRUSCAN VALIDATION CODES

     If you have installed any new software or programs on your system,
and are running VIRUSCAN or VSHIELD with the check validation codes
/CV option, you will need to reinstall validation codes to the new
files with the add validation codes /AV option of VIRUSCAN.
Additionally, the SCANVAL.VAL hidden file containing validation codes
for the partition table, boot sector, COMMAND.COM, and system files
may have to be replaced. The MS-DOS 5.00 SETVER.EXE file contains
self-modifying code and can not have a validation code added to it.
The quickest way to update the validation codes is to remove all
validation codes from the hard disk and then add them back on by
running VIRUSCAN with the /RV and then the /AV options, and then
removing the validation code from SETVER.EXE by typing "
SCAN C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE /RV" and pressing enter.
VIRUSCAN Version 8.3V86                                Page 15


NOTE: This applies to any new version of DOS, as well as any
programs which you install on your system.


DOS 5 AND REFORMATTING INFECTING FLOPPIES

     If you are reformatting infected floppy disks under DOS 5.0,
be sure to add the /U switch to the FORMAT command.  This tells DOS
to do an Unconditional format of the disk, and not to save the original
(infected) boot sector of the disk.  This should be done to prevent the
virus from reappearing by unformatting the disk.
