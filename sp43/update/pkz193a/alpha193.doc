                                 ALPHA 1.93

Due to the extensive changes in PKZIP including the incorporation of our
new data compression technology, this ALPHA version is being made
available for a wide-spread test.  PLEASE be aware that this is NOT
final software, and must be treated as such.  It is EXTREMELY LIKELY
that files created with this version of PKZIP will NOT be compatible
with future/final releases of the product.  Therefore, do NOT use this
program to archive any data which cannot be replaced easily.  BBS SysOps
SHOULD NOT convert their archives to this release of PKZIP.  Although it
is true that significant space savings can be realized on all BBS's by
converting to the new compression, PLEASE wait until the final version
is available to ensure compatibility with your users and other BBS's.

This generation of PKZIP offers the following significant improvements
over previous releases:

1)  ALL NEW COMPRESSION ALGORITHM.  This new process allows PKZIP to
    compress data TIGHTER and FASTER.  In fact, the new FAST method gets
    more compression than the maximum compression in PKZIP 1.10, yet is
    almost as fast as Shrinking!

2)  MULTI-VOLUME ARCHIVES.  PKZIP can now create and extract ZIP files
    which cross more than one disk.  This is not functional in this
    Alpha 1.93 version.

3)  EMS SUPPORT.  When sufficient EMS is available PKZIP now requires
    only 85K of conventional memory to run.  Without EMS PKZIP requires
    183K.  PKUNZIP requires approximately 75K if EMS is present and
    approximately 81K without EMS.

NEW PKZIP OPTIONS
=================
Brackets [] are used in command option descriptions only to indicate the
position of optional or required switches and are NEVER typed as part of
a command.

****
Compression Type
-e[s/n/x]

Specifying this parameter allows you to select the compression type you
desire.  (s) specifies the FAST compression algorithm, (x) specifies the
EXTRA compression algorithm.  (n) specifies the NORMAL (default)
compression type and is provided to override the configuration file in
future revisions.

Examples:

        pkzip -es test.zip *.doc
        pkzip -ex test2.zip *.gif

****
Date Specifier
-t[mmyydd]    (files on or AFTER this date)
-T[mmyydd]    (files BEFORE this date)

With this option, you can specify a date so that only files with a date
that is equal to or more recent/older will be included in the PKZIP
operation.  These options MAY be combined, but take care not to have
them overlap or you will exclude all files!

Examples:

        pkzip -ex -m -T010191 oldstuff *.wk1

	This example would compress all files matching the file
	specification *.wk1 and created before January 1st, 1991, and
	place them into the ZIP file called 'oldstuff.zip'.  This
	example is also using the EXTRA compression option and MOVING
	the files (deleting them after they are compressed).

        pkzip -t110191 catalog catalog.*

	This example would compress all files matching the file
	specification catalog.* (i.e. all files names catalog,
	regardless of extension) and created on or after November
	1st, 1991, and copy them into a ZIP files called 'catalog.zip'.

****
Create Multi-Volume Archives
-&

This feature is not functional in this ALPHA 1.93 version, but will be
in the final release of the product.

When this option is specified, and a ZIP file is being created on a
REMOVABLE DOS media device, PKZIP has permission to create a ZIP file
that is larger than that single media.  When a ZIP file reaches the
point where it would exceed the capacity of the storage device, the user
is prompted to insert another one.  In the case of standard floppy disks
(360K/720K/1.2M/1.44M) these disks may be formatted on-the-fly, that is,
if an un-formatted disk is inserted it will be formatted before PKZIP
continues to write the archive.

****
Open files in compatibility mode
-=

When this option is specified, PKZIP will open files for archiving in
compatibility mode, as opposed to 'sharing' mode.  On some systems this
will bypass any network sharing and allow PKZIP to read files opened by
other programs or applications.

****
Disable EMS usage
-+

If you experience strange behavior when testing PKZIP, try using this
option. When this option is on PKZIP will use only conventional memory.
Use of this switch may reveal problems or incompatibilities with your
EMS driver.  Please report these occurances.

===================
NEW PKUNZIP OPTIONS
===================
Brackets [] are used in command option descriptions only to indicate the
position of optional or required switches and are NEVER typed as part of
a command.

****
Command line options for PKUNZIP may now be combined!  This was possible
with previous versions of PKZIP but never before with PKUNZIP.  For
example in the past if you wanted to extract a ZIP file while restoring
directory paths AND overwrite any previously existing files by the same
name you needed to give the command with separate -d -o options, you may
now combine them as the single option -do.

Please note: As with PKZIP, you still MUST separate options which take
additional parameters themselves, such as -e (extract files in
designated order).  The -ed option is the extract files in order of file
date, thus if you had planned it to also restore directories it would
not be interpreted in that fashion.

****
Exclude Files
-xfilename
-x@exclude.lst

PKZIP allows you to create plain ASCII text files containing file names
that you wish to compress, or exclude from an operation.  Now with this
option you may specify a list of files to EXCLUDE from an unzip
operation, or a particular file.

Example:

        pkunzip testfile.zip -xmanual.txt

	This example would extract the files contained in the archive
	'testfile.zip' but not the file 'manual.txt'

        pkunzip -d a:project2.zip -x@nowant.lst

	This example would extract the files contained in the archive
	'project2.zip' (which incidentally is located on the a: drive
	and is having it's directory structure restored via the -d
	option and the a: being added to the file name).  The files
	contained in the list file 'nowant.lst' would NOT be extracted
	from this archive.

****
Disable EMS usage
-+

If you experience strange behavior when testing PKUNZIP, try this
option. When this option is on PKUNZIP will use only conventional
memory.  Use of this switch may reveal problems or incompatibilities
with your EMS driver.  Please report these occurances.

****
New Overwrite Option
(automatic)

Past versions of PKUNZIP, when encountering a file it was extracting
that already existed, would prompt you as to whether or not you wished
to overwrite the existing file.  This question could only be answered in
a yes or no manner.

Starting with this revision, PKUNZIP will now prompt you with:

File already exists overwrite (y/n/a/r)?

The four possible responses to this question are:

Y - Yes, overwrite the existing file with the version that is contained
    in the archive.

N - No, leave the existing file alone and skip to the next file.

A - All, overwrite the existing file, and do so for any others that are
    run across as well.  This is useful if you forget to specify -o when
    you give the original PKUNZIP command.

R - Rename it!  This will prompt you for a new name of the file and then
    extract the file in the archive to this new name.  This is very
    useful when extracting downloads from BBS systems, which frequently
    contain files such as 'readme.doc' or 'manual.doc' in many different
    files.
