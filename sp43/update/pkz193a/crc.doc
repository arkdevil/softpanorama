
This is a copy of the screen presented by the test of the PKZ193A.EXE
file containing the alpha distribution.  The column labeled "CRC-32"
contains values that are unique to that particular file.  By comparing
this number to the number displayed by PKUNZIP, it is possible to
determine that the file is identical to the files we are distributing.
If there is any discrepancy in the numbers it should be reported to
PKWARE immediately.

Older versions of PKUNZIP can generate this report as well, the only
difference will be that the "Method" column will report "unknown"
rather than "A-Xtra".
