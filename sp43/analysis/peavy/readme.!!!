                            Resources Required

This program was developed on a Dell System 316 (386-SX) system having 5
Mb RAM, 100 Mb Hard Drive, Super VGA Color.  Also used was a Dell System
316SX with 2 Mb RAM and 80 Mb Hard Drive, VGA Color Plus.

The program is intended to run on almost any system that is supported by
Turbo Pascal Version 6.0 for development.  It's even possible that it may
work on a system having as little as 256Kb of RAM but no guarantees.

Subject to the limitations below, the source codes are supplied without
charge and without warranty.  The source is highly sensitive to Turbo
Pascal Version 6.0 and will NOT compile on earlier versions.  Attempts to
modify it to compile under earlier versions are DANGEROUS since pointer
manipulations are performed that are incompatible with the heap managers
of earlier versions of Turbo Pascal.  BE WARNED.

This work was done by William L. Peavy, Houston Texas as a private research
endeavor.

I am interested in feedback, suggestions, constructive criticism, and
success stories.  A few "atta boys" wouldn't hurt either.  I can be reached
via Compuserve (70042,2310), via the HAL-PC Telecom-1 BBS or via the HAL-PC
Telecom-2 BBS.

                               Running TPU6

To run the program, simply type TPU6 at the command-line prompt.  You will
be asked for the name of the unit.  Reply with the name of the .TPU file
but WITHOUT the .TPU extension.  The unit must be in the current directory
or in some directory on the current path, either as "unit.TPU" or imbedded
in "TURBO.TPL".  You will then be asked whether or not to disassemble the
object code.  Be careful here.  SYSTEM.TPU will produce over 700K of output
in file SYSTEM.LST.  These files can be copied to PRN: but they are verbose.

Enjoy!
