A.  The motto of the product - "ArtGraph - Engineering Graphics"
B.  The product belongs to the second category:
    automatization of work in MS DOS.
C.  Age : 24.
D.  Age category : Borland-Pro.
E.  Annotation :
       ArtGraph package consists of several Turbo Pascal (ver. 5.0
    and higher) units  which perform support of 2-D linear graphics,
    bar charts, pie charts and histograms. ArtGraph fills the gap of
    presentation graphics in Turbo languages.

G.  Operation instructions :

    LIST OF FILES ON THE DISKETTE

1. README       - text you are reading now.

2. ATT.BGI      - BGI device drivers.
   CGA.BGI
   EGAVGA.BGI
   HERC.BGI

4. ArtGraph units' interfaces (contain declarations of
   all ArtGraph routines).

   ARTGRAPH.DOC  - basic package unit
   GlOBALS.DOC   - global definitions
   PRESENT.DOC   - presentation graphics unit
   SPLINE.DOC    - spline-interpolation
   DYNPLOT.DOC   - dynamic plotting

5. ARTDEMOE.PAS  - demo source code.
6. DEMOE.TXT     - comments used in demo.
7. ARTDEMOE.EXE  - ArtGraph demo.

8. Examples of possible data structure realisations.
   DARRAY.PAS   -  unit realising structure used in demo.
   EXAMPLE1.PAS -  other examples
   EXAMPLE2.PAS
   EXAMPLE3.PAS

9. ArtGraph TPU-files
   ARTGRAPH.TPU
   PRESENT.TPU
   SPLINE.TPU
   DYNPLOT.TPU
   GLOBALS.TPU
   DARRAY.TPU
   MATH.TPU
   MESSAGE.TPU
   UTILUNIT.TPU
   MENUUTIL.TPU

10. DEFAULTS.INC - compiler directives used in ArtGraph.

   WE RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE OF WORK :

1. Copy all files from dikette to hard disk.
   The work with diskette is possible as well. 
2. Run ARTDEMOE.EXE demo program. 
   Note:   BGI-driver and DEMOE.TXT file must be in the same directory.
        ArtGraph routines work in different display modes. But as this
        demo was tested in CGA, EGA and EGAmono modes, we advise you to
        run ArtGraph demo in the same modes. EGA mode is the most
        attractive.

3. Study ArtGraph package interfaces (*.doc files) and demo
   source code (ARTDEMOE.PAS file)
4. Study examples of possible artgraph data stucture
   realisations (EXAMPLE?.PAS files)
5. Test ArtGraph making your own source code (use Turbo Pascal
   ver.5.5 for compilation)
   We recommend you first to use our data structure (DARRAY.PAS unit).
   In this case your program heading must contain the following
   source code :

{$I defaults.inc}  { compiler directives }
Program ArtGraphTest;
Uses
  Graph,     { standart TP unit }
  DArray,    { dynamic arrays manipulations }
{---- Include this units to test Present/Spline/DynPlot routines ----}
  Present,   { presentation graphics unit }
  Spline,    { spline-interpolation }
  DynPlot,   { dynamic plotting }
{____________________________________________________________________}

  Globals,   { global definitions }
  ArtGraph;  { basic package unit }

  {-- Your variable definitions and source code ------}
    ..............................................
  {___________________________________________________}

6. Now if you have become experienced enough in ArtGraph, try to construct
   your own data structure to convince yourself that ArtGraph is
   a universal data structure manipulator.
