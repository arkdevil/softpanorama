                    USE OF McAFEE ASSOCIATES PROGRAMS

     The  McAfee Associates VIRUSCAN series is distributed as shareware
for  home  use,  but  must  be licensed  for  use  within  a  business,
corporation,  or organization.  This includes educational  institutions
and  government  agencies.   If you have or suspect  a  computer  virus
infection, you are allowed to use the software for five(5) days free of
charge  to  isolate and remove the computer virus or  suspect  computer
virus.  We will provide you with assistance if requested.
     If you are a shareware distributor you may distribute all software
listed  below  in the registration form as long as you  contact  McAfee
Associates   for  permission  first.   You  must  distribute  all   the
files  intact  and in unmodified form (duplicate files may be  removed)
and  may not charge more than a reasonable disk copying fee.  You  must
obtain updates from our BBS at the number below.
     If  you are a System Operator and run a publically-accessable  BBS
for  which there is no usage fee then you may use the software free  of
charge on your BBS system--that's our way of saying thanks.
