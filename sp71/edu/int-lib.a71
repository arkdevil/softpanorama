VT100 emulation is possible but not explicitly present.

GLADIS is public access and it does not require a password for                  
access.  The catalog covers the holdings of most UCB libraries,                 
including the main library, the Moffitt Undergraduate Library,                  
the Bancroft Library and some 23 branch libraries.  The catalog                 
is complete for monographic holdings from 1977 to the present                   
and incomplete for monographic holdings prior to that date.                     
We are in the process of converting older monographic records,                  
so more of these records appear in the catalog daily.  All of                   
the serial titles, both past and present, are reflected in GLADIS.              
GLADIS also contains records for maps, manuscripts, audiovisual                 
materials and computer software.  Circulation information (whether              
an item is checked out or not) is available for some library                    
locations (six libraries as of September, 1989).

The CONSER file is a subset of the authenticated MARC CONSER file.              
It contains approximately 220,000 bibliographic records for serials             
that were coded  c  (current) in byte 6 of the 008 field.                       
Update tapes containing new records and changes are processed monthly.          
The records are cataloged using the same indexing rules that are                
applied to the CARL bibliographic files. Libraries may access this              
file for downloading bibliographic records through CARL Serials Control.

VT100 emulation is supported and logoff instructions are provided.              
                                                                                
                                                                                
Instructions:                                                                   
You can use telnet to connect to DELCAT.                                        
                                                                                
After you are connected to DELCAT, press the RETURN key to see a                
list of valid terminal types.  You may have to press the RETURN key             
2-3 times.  If you have connected in line mode, use TYPETERM as                 
your terminal type.  If you are using a Sun workstation, use VT100              
as your terminal type.  You should also telnet to DELCAT from a                 
"csh-tool" window.  Do not telnet from a "cmd-tool" window.                     
Otherwise, select the terminal type closest to the one you are                  
using.                                                                          
                                                                                
In response to the ENTER TERMINAL TYPE: prompt, type your terminal              
type and press the RETURN key.  Press the RETURN key again when the             
"Welcome to DELCAT" screen appears, and follow the directions as                
outlined on the resulting screen of instructions.                               
                                                                                
To log off DELCAT, type either QUIT or EXIT and press the RETURN                
key.

LUIS (Library User Information Service) is the online catalog of the            
State University System (SUS) libraries.  LUIS runs on hardware                 
belonging to the NERDC.  The software is maintained by the Florida              
Center for Library Automation (FCLA), a SUS agency.                             
                                                                                
There are actually nine LUIS catalogs, one for each university.  For            
each library, the percentage of its collection searchable in LUIS is            
different and is always changing.  To find out what a library's LUIS            
catalog covers, contact that library.

4.  You will see the message SIGN-ON COMPLETE.  Press the clear key to          
clear the screen, then type "luis" and press enter to display a menu            
showing each of the catalogs available in LUIS.  Type the number                
associated with the desired LUIS catalog, and press enter.  This                
places you in that card catalog and gives you the LUIS: LIBRARY USER

on to the catalog of your choice.  Follow the instructions on the

How to Search in LUIS                                                           
                                                                                
LUIS is a "user friendly" computer system.  It has self-instructing             
introductory screens, "help" screens, and prompt messages on each               
screen that you can consult for guidance.  You need only know that a            
search of the catalog must be made under AUTHOR, TITLE, or SUBJECT by           
typing one of the following commands into the terminal and pressing             
the ENTER key.                                                                  
                                                                                
   a = author's name (last name first)                                          
                                                                                
       (e.g., a = asimov)                                                       
                                                                                
   t = title of a book or journal                                               
                                                                                
       (e.g., t = robots of dawn                                                
                                                                                
   s = subject heading                                                          
                                                                                
       (e.g., s = computer)                                                     
                                                                                
   sm = medical subject heading                                                 
                                                                                
       (e.g., sm = genetics)                                                    
                                                                                
By following other basic card catalog rules (such as ignoring initial           
articles), you can rapidly gain access to all catalog entries that              
match the request.  Typing in a full author, title, or subject heading          
is not necessary to get a response.                                             
                                                                                
Exiting LUIS                                                                    
                                                                                
To exit LUIS, press your clear key once or twice until the screen is            
clear.  If you have problems clearing your screen with the clear key,           
you can clear the screen by typing #$#$ on the command line and then            
pressing enter.  This gets you out of the catalog you are in, but you           
are still signed on to LUIS.  When the screen is clear, type                    
                                                                                
      logoff                                                                    
                                                                                
and press enter.  When you see the message SIGN-OFF IS COMPLETE, you            
are logged off and the message NERDC VTAM IS ACTIVE will reappear.              
You are not logged off if you do not see these messages.  To terminate          
the telnet connection, type UNDIAL and press enter when the NERDC VTAM          
IS ACTIVE message reappears.                                                    
                                                                                
Questions and Problems                                                          
                                                                                
If you get the message "APPLID NOT AVAILABLE" when you enter                    
"nerluis", then LUIS is not available and you will have to try later.

The online catalog system is based on IBM DOBIS/Leuven software. The catalog    
contains the union catalog for 5 library units: General Libraries (Woodruff,    
Chandler, and Chemistry Libraries), Health Sciences Center Library, Law Library,
Oxford College Library, and Theology Library.                                   
                                                                                
The online catalog database currently contains more than 500,000 bibliographic  
records, representing approximately 40% of the total holdings.  A retrospective 
conversion project has been started.

After the VM screen is displayed, press ENTER (normally the return key) to      
get a CP READ.  Type DIAL VTAM and press ENTER.  At the VTAM screen, type LIB   
and press ENTER.  When the CICS screen appears, press the PF1 key.  The next    
screen will be the initial library systems screen.  All references to pressing  
RETURN on the library screens mean to press the key which sends ENTER (normally 
the RETURN key).  To exit, terminate the telnet connection.

VT100 emulation is supported and logoff instructions are provided.              
                                                                                
Northwestern University's "LUIS" online catalog may be accessed                 
from other academic institutions via the Internet, using TELNET.                
The library catalog's TELNET address is PACX.ACNS.NWU.EDU.  Once                
connected, press <ENTER> or <RETURN>; you will receive the prompt               
"enter class".  Type  60, then press <ENTER> or <RETURN> twice.                 
At this point you will be prompted for a terminal type; VT100 is                
to be preferred, assuming your local communications software will               
provide VT100 emulation.  Pressing <ENTER> or <RETURN> again will               
provide you the online catalog's introductory screen.                           
                                                                                
To sign off, please enter a percent sign (%) at any prompt.  You                
can then disconnect your TELNET session.  PLEASE NOTE that the                  
online catalog AUTOMATICALLY disconnects if there is no keyboard                
activity within a two-minute period.                                            
                                                                                
Remote users of Northwestern's LUIS catalog who may be familiar                 
with other NOTIS-based online catalogs will note some differences               
in our implementation.  Of particular interest may be NU's                      
provision of cross-references in the online catalog, a feature                  
that is to appear in the commercial release scheduled for the end               
of 1990.  This LUIS version does not provide keyword/Boolean                    
searching, but does offer what we call "search qualification,"                  
the ability of a user to limit an author, title, or subject                     
search result by any of several elements present in the                         
precoordinated indexes: date, format (e.g., serial, video), other               
word, or holding library.  Use of this feature is explained in a                
help screen which may be accessed by typing an ampersand (&).

You can dial-up to THOR with a variety of microcomputers and software.          
For whatever hardware and software combination you use, you must learn          
how to type the IBM <enter> and <clear> functions.  This information can        
be obtained from the Library Systems Department (317-494-2857).  The            
most common combination is an IBM PC compatible computer with VT100             
terminal emulation.  For this combination these key combinations work:          
                                                                                
        <enter>         <ctrl> and <return> simultaneously                      
        <clear>         esc O [capital O] p                                     
                                                                                
After connecting to the computer, press <return> several times until the        
system responds with the "DIAL:" prompt.                                        
                                                                                
                                                                                
ACCESS FROM THE INTERNET                                                        
                                                                                
Users of any computer connected to the Internet (which includes most            
multi-user computers on campus) can connect directly to THOR without            
using a telephone line.  Different combinations of computer hardware            
will connect in different ways, but some common types are discussed             
below.  If none of these combinations seem to describe your situation,          
or neither method works, call the Library Systems Department (317-494-          
2857) for assistance.  You might also get help from your local computer         
system administrator.                                                           
                                                                                
From terminals connected to a UNIX computer:                                    
   - log on to your UNIX account as usual                                       
   - make sure the TERM environment variable is set correctly                   
   - type, "tn3270 lib.cc.purdue.edu" and press RETURN                          
                                                                                
From terminals connected to the VM (IBM) computer:

   - type, "telnet lib.cc.purdue.edu" and press ENTER                           
                                                                                
From many off-campus computers on the Internet:                                 
   - follow the appropriate set of instructions above                           
   - if "lib.cc.purdue.edu" does not work, use "128.210.9.8" instead            
                                                                                
The system should display the THOR database selection menu.  If anything        
else happens, or if the system prints numerous extraneous characters            
with the menu, disconnect and seek help.                                        
                                                                                
Once properly connected to THOR, you must know how to type the IBM              
<enter> and <clear> functions.  Users already connected to an IBM system        
can use the same keys that they use for their own account.  For UNIX            
users, these keys are set by their System Administrator for each                
terminal type.  Frequently, <ctrl> and <j> will work for <enter>, and           
<ctrl> and <z> will perform a <clear>, but check with your System               
Administrator for the correct combinations.

THOR is an on-line database of information about books, periodicals, and        
other materials in the Purdue University Libraries.  All serials and            
books added to the Libraries after June 1976 can be found in THOR.              
Records for older books are continually being added.                            
                                                                                
THOR is controlled through a set of single letter commands followed by          
an equal sign (=).  Type the command, your search topic, and press the          
ENTER key.  Upper and lower case are treated the same.  For instructions        
on searching, type the search command without the equal sign.  Example:         
"a" by itself gives instructions on author searching.                           
                                                                                
                                                                                
        Prior to searching, press the clear button until the THOR menu          
        screen appears.  Then select either the BOOK or FILM/VIDEO              
        database to search.

The online catalog database is stored on the IBM mainrame computer, CORNELLC,   
and includes records for approximately one-half of the five million volumes     
owned by the sixteen Cornell libraries. Most records are for materials          
acquired since 1973.  However, records for many items acquired before 1973      
have been added to the online catalog, including most holdings of the           
Africana, Engineering, Entomology,Hotel, ILR, Mathematics, Physical Sciences,   
and Veterinary libraries.                                                       
                                                                                
The online catalog is usually available from 6:30 am through 4:00 am. However,  
due to computer maintenance requirements, the online catalog might not be       
available from 10:00 pm Saturday to noon Sunday, and from 10:00 pm to           
midnight Sunday.  The online catalog is most heavily used from 2:00 to 4:00 pm  
weekdays and might be slow to respond during those hours.

The service has been known for some years as "Infotrac", a name                 
created at Rensselaer before there was a commercial product by that             
name.  The name will soon change to "Infotrax" in order to avoid                
confusion with this product.                                                    
                                                                                
Once connected, you will be prompted for terminal type;  enter ?                
for a list of possible answers. After entering your terminal type,              
you will get a banner, and a request to type "return".  Finally,                
you get the following menu:

The Josiah Search Menu supports searches by author, title,                      
subject, and author/title combinations.                                         
Help is available at any point by pressing the PF1 key.                         
PF key alternatives are also supported                                          
by typing PF1 (or PF3, PF5, etc.) after any ">>" prompt.                        
                                                                                
The direct command language is a modified form of the language                  
developed by the Western Library Network (WLN).                                 
Use of this Josiah option requires familiarity                                  
with the WLN command language.  The direct command supports                     
bibliographic file searches by author, title, subject, series,                  
isbn/issn, and year of publication; authority file searches by                  
author, subject, and series; and call number browse.  Boolean                   
and keyword are also available.                                                 
                                                                                
The menu searches are programmed to execute the command language                
behind the scenes. Each menu search uses the text typed on the menu             
screen as the search key for a direct command. In addition, each menu           
search is programmed to try alternate search strategies in order to             
locate bibliographic records.

The Old Dominion University Library holds over 1.6 million items in a variety   
of formats - microform, recordings, newspaper, periodical and book.  The        
library is a selective depository of U. S. government publications and          
documents of the State of Virginia.

      Telnet escape character is Control - ]                                    
      This means that the connection has been established.  Make a note of      
which character serves as your escape character.  It differs from system to     
system.  The escape character is useful for getting out of problem situations.  
       Press <Enter> ONCE to get GEAC's attention.  The GEAC catalogue then     
comes online.  At the end of the session, type END or QUIT, or for CMS users    
type F4.  While online, type HELP for help.    Good luck!

FOOTNOTE ON 3270 EMULATION:                                                     
                                                                                
1.  IF your host computer does NOT support full 3270 emulation, the VCU         
    computer will respond "Enter one of the following commands" and will        
    list only TWO commands: MSG and LOGOFF.  In this case, type LOGOFF.         
    Start over by substituting the command "tn3270", instead of "telnet",       
    i.e., type:                                                                 
                                                                                
          TN3250 VCUVM1.VCU.EDU    OR    TN3250 128.172.001.066                 
                                                                                
    If TN3270 is supported by your host, you will get the four choices,         
    including DIAL.   Type DIAL VTAM.  Follow the instructions above            
    continuing from the section: "Type the Letter L (for VCU Library            
    Catalog)"                                                                   
                                                                                
2.  If both the "telnet" and "tn3270" commands do not work properly, it         
    will not be possible at this time for you to use Internet to connect        
    to the VCU library catalog.

Description:                                                                    
                                                                                
The Network Library System (NLS) is the online public catalog of                
the libraries at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the                    
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.  NLS supports separate online                
catalogs for each campus.                                                       
                                                                                
The UW-Madison online catalog contains more than 1.7 million                    
titles cataloged since 1976, located in 25 libraries on the                     
campus and at the Center for Research Libraries in Chicago.  This               
represents roughly 50% of the collections.  The UW-Milwaukee                    
catalog contains approximately 900,000 titles and represents 85%                
of the general collection.                                                      
                                                                                
                                                                                
Network Access:                                                                 
                                                                                
If available on your system, please use tn3270 (telnet supporting               
3270 emulation) to access blue.adp.wisc.edu                                     
When connected you are presented a menu from which you select                   
NLS1, the library catalog.  (If you don't know how your function                
keys are mapped, TAB to the option you want and press ENTER.)                   
                                                                                
Telnet access is also available via a gateway machine providing                 
the necessary 3270 emulation.  From your local host use telnet to               
access nls.adp.wisc.edu .  You will be prompted                                 
to enter a terminal type.  VT100 is the default, or you can enter               
the command list to display a list of supported terminal types.                 
Upon entering a valid terminal type, select NLS1 from the menu                  
displayed to connect to the library catalog.                                    
                                                                                
Upon entering NLS, a screen is displayed at which you either                    
press ENTER to search the Madison catalog or type Mil and press                 
ENTER to search the Milwaukee catalog.                                          
                                                                                
To exit, enter the command exit on any screen to return to the                  
Main Menu.  Here you select the option to quit.  This returns                   
control to your local host.

More detailed information on accessing NLS via the Internet is

Tn3270 And Telnet".  For a copy of this document, or any other

Note on keyboard mappings:                                                      
                                                                                
Because keyboard mappings are defined by the tn3270 software on                 
the client's host computer, we are not able to tell you                         
definitively how your keyboard will be mapped.  The following                   
chart shows a selection of the tn3270 keyboard mapping used on                  
many UW Madison VAX computers.  These definitions are also used

NB      Access can also be obtained by direct dial-in or by using X.25,         
     details of which are available separately.                                 
                                                                                
To gain access:-                                                                
                                                                                
0       Terminal setup:  no specific terminal settings required.                
        Terminals already connected to AARNet should not be altered.            
                                                                                
1.      Telnet to:      library.deakin.oz.au.                                   
                                                                                
        You may need to have already established a session on a computer at     
     your institution, which is connected to AARNet.  Alternatively, you may    
     be able to establish a connection directly from your terminal server.      
     Consult your local Computing Centre for further advice.                    
                                                                                
2.      If the connection is successful, you will receive something similar     
      to:-

                login:                                                          
                                                                                
3.      Type:   alice                                                           
        Press:  [RETURN]                                                        
                                                                                
4.      The system will then indicate when ALICE was last used, display any     
     "messages of the day", and then try to determine the type of terminal      
     being used.  If it cannot be determined automatically, the system will     
     prompt you for the device type.

        Press:  [RETURN]                                                        
                                                                                
        (If you don't know the terminal type, simply press [RETURN] and the     
     system will attempt to provide a reasonable format).                       
                                                                                
5.      The system will try to establish a connection to the Library's          
     computer.  If the connection fails the system will respond with 'Remote    
     is busy'.  The system will then break the connection with your             
     terminal, and you will need to restart from Step 1 to establish a new      
     connection.                                                                
                                                                                
        If the connection is established, the system will respond with:-        
                                                                                
        a)      clearing the screen                                             
        b)      give instructions for starting and finishing an ALICE session   
        i.e.                                                                    
                                                                                
                Type 'Q' to start, <CR>~.<CR> to end.                           
                                                                                
        You can now start ALICE, and any subsequent commands will need to be    
     ALICE commands.  Usually, the appropriate ALICE commands are displayed     
     at the bottom of the screen, but a user should consult the above-          
     mentioned Guide before any serious use of the system.

1.      At any stage of a search within ALICE, you may leave it.                
                                                                                
        Press:  [RETURN]                                                        
        Type:   ~.              (i.e. tilde, dot)                               
        Press:  [RETURN]                                                        
                                                                                
2.      The system will immediately break the connection to the Library's       
     computer, and then break the connection between your terminal and the      
     system.

POLYDOS.UNI-KONSTANZ.DE is the machine of Univ. Konstanz' library, running      
KOALA, a proprietary online cataloging/database software.                       
                                                                                
KOALA may be used to scan the library's inventory of about 1.4 million          
volumes (no journals yet) for a given volume, using (combinations               
of) about a dozen different search criteria, such as ISBN, ISSN, authors'       
names, title etc.                                                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
The user interface is TTY-like and KEPT ENTIRELY IN GERMAN.                     
It features an online help system, and a rudimentary message handling           
facility to contact the database managers.                                      
                                                                                
KOALA can be reached via telnet to polydos.uni-konstanz.de (134.34.3.5),        
on ***PORT 775***, during library opening hours (8:00 to 21:30 local time       
on Mon to Fri, 9:00 to 19:00 local time on Sat.).                               
                                                                                
There are a few technical limitations to using KOALA:                           
    - the machine is quite slow (and suffers from overload)                     
    - the number of KOALA sessions running in parallel is limited               
      (currently to 9)
