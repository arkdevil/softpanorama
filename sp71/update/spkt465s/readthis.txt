        Welcome to HyperWare's SpeedKit Version 4.65


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows Users, make sure not to use the HyperDisk defaults.  The optimum
settings for HyperDisk and Windows is to use between 1/4 and 1/2 of your
memory and stagged writes.  To do this you must use the C:nnnn parameter
and the S parameter.  If you are running the install program to install
HyperDisk, just enter in an amount of memory, don't accept the default, and
when it asks you for options add the letter S to the option line.  This will
make Windows run a whole lot better.

DoubleSpace, XtraDrive, Stacker and SuperStor users!  The answer is YES,
HyperDisk will work with these compression products.

                          Overall Changes

  - Installer. HyperWare SpeedKit now has an integrated one piece installer
    that is far better than the old batch file routines to install
    SpeedKit. We are continuing to improve this program and any feedback is
    welcome.

                       Changes to HyperDisk

  - Support for XtraDrive 3.0 drive compression.

  - Bug fixes for DoubleSpace

  - Default memory usage is now 1/2 of available system memory, not all
    available memory.



                       Changes to HyperKey

  - HyperKey is now on the same numbering system as HyperDisk, this release
    will be 4.65 of HyperKey.


  - M:±  Enable/disable SmartCaps(tm).  Default is disabled.
         Capslock is automatically turned off when a shift key is pressed,
         simulating the actions of a typewritter. No action if the [Ctrl]
         and/or [Alt] keys are also pressed.



                      Changes to HyperScreen

  - HyperScreen is now on the same numbering system as HyperDisk, this
    release will be 4.65 of HyperScreen.

  - M:±     Detect mouse for screen unblanking.  Default is enabled.
            Screen unblanks if the mouse is moved or a button is pressed.

  - W:±     This switch is no longer supported.  Hyperscr is always
            disabled when Windows is executed and renabled when Windows
            terminates.

_______________        ______________________________        _______________

  05/01/92  HyperDisk V4.32 release

* Fix memory resizing problem (/CW:nnn) while running with Windows 3.1.
  Windows 3.1 changed the startup and shutdown procedures, this version works
  correctly with these new conditions.

* Add alternate Windows 3.0/3.1 memory resizing method. Two new command are
  supported. /CB:nnn sets the minimum base free memory for Windows.
  Default is 512K bytes.  /CP:nn sets the percent free memory to be used by
  HyperDisk. Default 35%. Setting /CW:nnn disables this automatic method.

  Example: Your machine has 6098K of Extended memory. HyperDisk under DOS
  uses 4096K. When Windows starts up HyperDisk frees the 4096K and request
  the total free memory size; now 6098K. HyperDisk then subtracts the base
  free memory size (Default 512K) for a result of 5585K and takes 35% to
  obtain 1954K as the new HyperDisk cache size. (Actual Cache value will be
  rounded  down to the nearest integer multiple of the buffer size (Denoted
  as Sectors/Buffer).

* Fixed uninstall problem when operating with QEMM386 Stealth mode active.

* Disable QEMM386's Stealth Mode advanced disk/diskette support  when operating
  with Windows 3.0/3.1.

* Allow memory resizing (/XD, /XA, and XC commands) while running under
  DesqView.

* Added Stacker and SuperStor detection to eliminate installation order
  requirements. However, when the entire disk is compressed and no part
  of the non-commpressed disk is accessable you will have to load HyperDisk
  in the CONFIG.SYS file before Stacker or SuperStor to cache the drive.


* Added check to prevent write cacheing Hard Disk Boot area. Some Anti-Virus
  programs issue errors if this area is write-cache-delayed.

* Added additional test for Primary DMA type controllers (i.e. Adaptec 154xB)

* Changed XMS memory block locking default. HyperDisk now locks the XMS memory
  block as was previously done in versions 4.21 and earlier. Added /XML switch
  to change XMS memory block locking. XML or XML:+ locks XMS block (default);
  XML:- unlocks XMS memory block. Some XMS providers and/or applications alter
  HyperDisk's XMS memory block if it is unlocked. (DR-DOS 6.0's EMM386 and an
  early Lotus 123-R3 release revealed this problem. Locking the block prevents
  these bugs from destroying the cache memory buffer.)

* Added additional XMS diagnostic display information.

__________________________________________________________________

  01/10/92  HyperDisk V4.31 release

* Add update modified buffer when DOS DISK RESET (INT 21, 0Dh) is called.
  /KD:- will enable update. /KD default.

* Fix timing problem with Advanced Updateing when operating under
  QEMM386 Stealth Mode.

  11/22/91  HyperDisk V4.30 release

* Correct minor problem with floppy write caching.

* Automatic QEMM 6.0 Stealth support. Set VI:- to disable.

* Fixed problem with DesqView Exit operation.

* Reworked Interrupt 09 (Keyboard) logic to prevent cursor
  key problems while still handling reboot <Ctrl><Alt><Del> detection.

* Fix problem with HIMEM.SYS late INT 15-88 intercept being
  bypassed.

* Add additional verify operations when is verify enabled.

* Make XS and XSL inactive if loaded high with external loader
  (i.e. devicehigh, loadhi, etc.)

* Changed floppy handling with Disk Manager (OMTI) systems.

* Fix floppy media change problem after BIOS verify!
  Fixes Safe Format problem and DOS 5.00 Setup/Format problem, et. al.

* Altered read ahead logic to improve handling of bad sectors.

* Fixed problem with linear read perdictor.

* Changed XMS Lock/Unlock method to lock on direct transfers only, otherwise
  block is always unlocked.

*  Fix HYPERDK.EXE staying resident sometimes!

* Additional changes for IDE drive compatibility.

  _______________________________


  04/22/91  HyperDisk V4.21 release

* Add option to disable the floppy change notice tone. Select /KT to disable
  the change tone.

* Automatic detection of Sumo Systems SCSI BIOS to prevent hangup due to
  faulty Sumo BIOS function limit test.

* Add detection of End Of File (EOF) mark in command files (/XF:file).
  Fixes problem with WordStar text files.

* Fix HyperStb lockup problem with SpedStor detection.

* Change HyperDisk action call drive ID value. Fixes some IDE problems.

* Add code to allow use of Pre-Allocated XMS/EMS memory via XM:handle_num

* Fix XSL report message to display correct segment address.

* Restore Uninstall (/XU) in Shareware version. Use HYPERSTB.EXE for best
  results. Install HYPERSTB.EXE in the CONFIG.SYS file, install HyperDisk
  in the  AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

* Relax Chips & Tech. presence test. Fixes some 212 Neat and 302 problems.

* Fixed Disk Manager and SpeedStor configuration problem. Regression error
  in version 4.20.

* Fixed Advanced Update interlock problem.

* Change XMS free memory determination. XMS-HMA area was being reserved
  twice.

* Revise vector reset code for soft-boot.

* New interlock method for Network severs, Desqview, Windows 3.0, etc.

* Revised EMS 3.2/4.0 testing and selection procedure. XT forces 4.0

* Add addition messages for C&T 82C212 configuration errors.

                 _______________________________

                  HyperDisk and Windows 3.0/3.1

HyperDisk gives you a true high-performance cache with the Win3 compatibility
of SmartDrive.

Load HIMEM.SYS (or QEMM 5.10+, 386Max) before HyperDisk.
Load HyperDisk before Windows.

HYPER386 or HYPER286 may be used for Windows and HIMEM.SYS.

HYPERDKX should be used with QEMM386, EMM386 or 386Max.

To enable the automatic release of XMS/EMS memory from the cache for Windows
use, you must load Windows with the /S or /3 switches.  Having 386ENH as your
default Win3 mode will not by itself enable the cache reduction.


Loading HyperDisk high in Chips and Tech. based machines and Windows 3:

Be sure to add the appropriate EMMEXCLUDE= statement to the [386Enh] section
of SYSTEM.INI.  EMMEXCLUDE=E800-EFFFF or EMMEXCLUDE=E400-EFFF will be correct
depending on how much memory is used by HyperDisk.


CAUTION:  Windows Enhanced mode provides time-sliced multitasking. If you use
staged write caching, be careful with <Ctrl><Alt><Del> (Soft Reboot) when
under Win3; it will restart your machine immediately without informing
HyperDisk of the impending reboot, and could thus cause loss of data not yet
written from the cache to the disk.  Always exit Windows or wait until the
disk updates are complete before you reboot your system!

                 _______________________________


"Load High" Users:  Packed File Corrupt Error!

If you encounter this error you should select the /OG option when you install
HyperDisk. Microsoft's EXEPACK program, used to compress executable program
files, has a bug that causes this error. To make these applications safe for
programs using XMS High Memory Area (HMA) obtain a copy of LZEXE to unpack
the application program and then optionally repack the application.  Also,
please beware that some programs that have been packed using EXEPACK have been
post-processed and can not be unpacked using the UNPACKER; for these you will
have to contact the product producer and request an non-packed version.
LZEXE is a great FREEWARE program by Fabrice Bellard, Grabels, France.

                 _______________________________


  02/03/91  HyperDisk V4.20 release

* DOS 5.00 Upper Memory Support with /XS option.

* Added ACER A20 Gate method.

* Relax DMA boundary testing when run with 80386 EMS emulators. Allows
  "Load-Hi" optimizer to load HyperDisk high.

* Enhanced LIM-EMS 4.0 level functional testing.

* Added new installations check method that uses the DOS multiplex interrupt.

* Added auto-selection for EMS 4.0 transfer mode. Falls back to EMS 3.2
  when in Windows 3.0 (avoid bug in Win 3.0 EMS code).

* Now HyperDisk will release EMS memory automatically when ever you start
  Windows 3.0 or Desqview 2.24+ just like SmartDrive and Windows 3.0. Use the
  CW:nnn parameter described below.

* Added EMS 4.0 memory move functions. Makes EMS as safe as XMS! The EMS
  memory model no longer needs to use the EMS frame to transfer data.
  Use XT and XT:- in the same way as XMS. XT selects EMS 4.0  memory move
  function, while XT:- selects EMS 3.2 frame access method (original).
  If you select no transfer buffer (U:-) then EMS 3.2 level frame mapping
  is used. Think of /XT as eXternal Transfer mode.

* Added new display field to indicate the active memory transfer method.
  This field displays the last used method.

* Change EMS far call to INT 67, works better with Desqview. To restore the
  original FAR CALL method specify UI:-

* Fix disabled Hotkey status report. Display format error.

* Changed Hotkey acknowledge beep to issue one beep at the beginning of
  the update action and two beeps when update and flush is complete.

* Add new method to determine drive parameters. This is a complete rewite
  of this facility.

* Extended Diagnostic report (/YD): display Logical volume BPB.

* Add special error handling for faulty drive controllers.

* Add No Read-Ahead mode: /NR  Allows disabling of read ahead operations
  to aid in debugging faulty disk controllers. Default is Read-Ahead with
  short-term disabling.

* Added: Split Shadow RAM loading (Load High) memory load. Loads code and
  data tables high and leave I/O transfer buffer low; specify XSL. If you
  have trouble loading HyperDisk high try this option.

* Added: Display of system access counts. Total system read/write request,
  saved accesses (cached sectors) and disk accesses. Specify /YD report.

* Fixed: PS/2 A20 Gate code problem.

* Enhanced: memory limits testing, generally tighting of error conditions.
* Added: DMA boundary test override /OD disables DMA boundary testing.

* Added: New stack location algorithm.

* Fixed: Problem with reallocation of maximum cache size.

* Fix HotKey lockup within Windows (introduced by V4.11)

* Combine Shadow Ram Type (Upper memory) field and program memory size
  message. Revised and moved the Hotkey Shift Key field.

* Improve Windows 3.0 and Desqview resize cache logic. If you use fixed size
  cache the startup and exit delays have been reduced.

* Added independent Floppy and Hard Disk verify commands. The report field has
  been changed to reflect the new states. The command syntax is:

    VF, VF:+ or VF:-   Verify Floppy Write operation.
        VF and VF:+ are identical and both enable verify operations. VF:-
        disables the verify after write operation and is the default.

    VH, VH:+ or VH:-   Verify Hard Write operation.
        VH and VH:+ are identical and both enable verify operations. VH:-
        disables the verify after write operation and is the default.

    V, V:+ and V:- is still supported and affect both drive types in the
        same manner as before (see HyperDisk user document).

* Revised the report panel fields combining the Hard and Floppy Staged Write
  fields into one. Extended the Verify Write field status for the new verify
  command.

* Modified the pause for key after "no parameter" report. After you install
  HyperDisk you can obtain a status report by running HyperDk (or any other
  installable HyperDisk model). If you specify no parameters HyperDisk will
  pause and ask for a key after the panel is displayed. With the new KW:nn
  command you can disable this pause or select a time delay before continuing.

   KW   Key Wait Time
        Selects wait for key after "No Parameter" status panel. KW or KW:+
        enables a pause after the status panel (default). KW:- disables the
        wait for a key mode. Alternately, you may select a time delay by
        specifing KW:nn, where nn is the number of seconds to wait before
        continuing automatically.

                 _______________________________

  9/15/90  HyperDisk V4.11 release

*  Desqview (2.23+) API interface for Startup and Shutdown callouts, Cache
   resizing on startup/exit just like SmartDrive does for Win3.  Use
   C:NNNN:nnnn on the HyperDisk line in your CONFIG or AUTOEXEC, or CW:nnn
   from the command line, as described below.

* Automatic XMS-A20 gate control for QEMM and 386Max. Prevents "Packed
  File Corrupt" error when first 64K of conventional memory is partly used
  (most DDs and TSRs loaded high) and XMS High Memory Area (HMA) is accessable.
  Removes need to specify "OG" when installing HyperDisk with QEMM & 386Max.

*  Prevent conflicting configurations by detecting SMARTDrive, Fastopen or
   PC-Kwik and aborting installation. Also disable cache if any of these
   products are installed later and the command processor is executed.

*  Added Windows 3.0 full API critical section interface support.
   Eliminates need for InDOSPolling=true switch.

*  Improved floppy error handling (Some 3.5 seek/settle problems).

*  Automatic override of OX command when no parameters are present.
   Add pause for key after no parameter change report panel.

                 _______________________________

  8/20/90  HyperDisk 4.10 release and earlier releases

  Windows 3.0/386 aware version:

* Now HyperDisk can release memory in the same manner as SmartDrv, reducing
the cache size when Win3 loads in Enhanced mode.  Syntax is C:NNNN:nnnn,
where NNNN is cache size outside of Win3 and nnnn is cache size to use with
Win3.  You may also use HYPERDK CW:nnnn from the DOS command line to set
the size of cache to use while in Windows. (You must be using XMS memory to
use this feature, and you must load Windows with the /3 parameter.)
Examples:

In the CONFIG:
DEVICE=HYPER386.EXE C:2048:512 ; Set Cache size 2Mb in DOS, 512K in Windows 3.0

From the command line (or in a batch file):
  HYPERDK  CW:512              ; Set Windows 3.0 Cache size to 512
  HYPERDK  CW:0                ; No Cache while in Windows 3.0

Default:
  HYPERDK  CW                  ; No size change when running Windows 3.0

* The XMS-A20 gate is closed automaticlly (OG:+)

* Floppy interrupts are disabled (XIF:-).

* Upon exit from Windows the original conditions (including the original
  cache size) are fully restored from the above accomodations for Win3.

* Report panel displays CW active parameter: Cache Size   : 2048:512

* Extended the Override Gate Exit (OG) function; now the A20 gate may may
  be closed on exit for any gate method.

  This message has been changed to support both keystrokes and Shift
  State Hotkeys. Shift state hotkeys allow entry of commands even when
  the foreground application has taken normal keyboard control (i.e.
  Microsoft Windows 3.0, SmartCom, et. al.). The new error message is
  proceeded by three beeps and the following message:

    HyperDisk Error......... RShft: Retry=LShft Skip=Ctrl Abort=Alt?

  You can enter: R or <RShift><LShift> for RETRY; S or <LShift><Ctrl>
  for SKIP; A or <RShift><Alt> for ABORT.  If no response is entered
  within four seconds a RETRY is automaticlly entered for you.

* Staged write error handling has been enhanced. If a disk write update
  fails, each sector is written and verified one-by-one. This insures the
  minimum loss of data if the disk surface has developed a bad spot. Hard
  errors are then helt in the cache until all of the writable updates are
  completed; then the errors are retried and if still failing the error is
  displayed and the user is prompted for the appropriate action.

*  Add new parameter to control XMS transfer mode control:

   XT   Selects XMS transfer mode in both Real and Protected mode.
   XTR  Selects XMS transfer mode in Real mode.
   XTP  Selects XMS transfer mode in Protected mode.

   Example: hyperdk XTR:- XTP:+   (This is the default setting)

   Used to avoid Microsoft HIMEM.SYS problems.

   Add special handling for XF command to prompt for console I/O: XF:CON
   Use for Windows 3.0 PIF default command line parameters

   Some cosmetic changes to display logic:

* OX   Disable report display unless OR override applied.
       OX or OX:+ disables report panel.
       OX:- restores report panel display (default).
       OR:- may be used to override OX setting.


   If you are currently using 386 Max, QEMM 5.0 or have a machine
   based on Chip & Technologies NEAT 210 or 300 Series chip sets
   you may load HyperDisk directly in upper memory (above 640K)!

   Just add: XS to the installation command line.

   Chips and Technologies Shadow Ram users:

   If you are using an EMS system that does not support XMS's Upper Memory
   Blocks (UMBs) such as EMMSYS, Windows 3.0 Intel 4.0 EMS, AST EEMS, etc.
   You will need to EXCLUDE the last part of the E000 segment of memory.
   Load HyperDisk first with the XS option set, examine the report panel
   to (second section of the report panel) find where HyperDisk is loaded.
   Next, edit your EMS device installation command line and exclude the
   area from use by your EMS manager. See your EMS product installation
   guide for details on excluding areas from EMS use.

   Note: Qualitas' 386MAX 4.04+ and Quarterdeck's QEMM 5.0+ directly
   support XMS UMB's and require no special procedures when installing
   HyperDisk with these products.

                 _______________________________

  HyperStb Pre-Install Binder for HyperDisk: 6/17/90

   A new program module HYPERSTB.EXE has been added to the HyperDisk
   package.  This program allows you to install and later uninstall
   HyperDisk easily and without conflict with other resident programs.
   Install HYPERSTB.EXE in either your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT
   files (normally in the same place as you would place the HyperDisk
   install statement). Later, either near the end of the AUTOEXEC.BAT
   or from the command line you may install HyperDisk. HYPERSTB's function
   is to reserve the resources for HyperDisk, preventing other resident
   programs installed later from conflicting with HyperDisk. HYPERSTB
   requires approximately 400 bytes!


   Example:

   device=c:hyperstb.exe


   No parameters are needed!

  HyperDisk you can obtain a status report by running HyperDk (or any other
  installable HyperDisk model). If you specify no parameters HyperDisk will
  pause and ask for a key after the panel is displayed. With the new KW:nn
  command you can disable this pause or select a time delay before continuing.

   KW   Key Wait Time
        Selects wait for key after "No Parameter" status panel. KW or KW:+
        enables a pause after the status panel (default). KW:- disables the
        wait for a key mode. Alternately, you may select a time delay by
        specifing KW:nn, where nn is the number of seconds to wait before
        continuing automatically.

            Example: hyperscr c:s:-  Restore the small cursor and unlock it.
