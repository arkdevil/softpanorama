SWAG (SourceWare Archival Group) is a collection of source code and program
examples for the PASCAL programming language. The material has been donated
by  various  PASCAL  programmers  from  around  the  world,  who  desire to
contribute to the advancement of  one of the greatest programming languages
there is.  MANY THANKS to all  who have contributed. As  such, NO Charge of
any kind is permitted for this work.

The material has been collected from various network conferences worldwide,
and organized  according to subject.  New material is  added quarterly, and
new SWAG  packets are available  from various BBS  sources on a  FIRST call
basis. See BBS.TXT for current support sites and how your BBS can join.


SWAG packets are available in 56 different catagories as follows :

       ANSI       ARCHIVES          CHARS        CMDLINE          COLOR
       COMM       COPYMOVE            CRC            CRT         CURSOR
   DATATYPE       DATETIME       DESQVIEW           DIRS            DOS
     DRIVES         EGAVGA        ENCRYPT           EXEC            FAQ
      FILES       FINDREPL       GRAPHICS       HARDWARE       INTERRUP
        ISR       JOYSTICK       KEYBOARD           MAIL           MATH
     MEMORY           MENU           MISC          MOUSE        NETWORK
    NUMBERS            OOP        PARSING       POINTERS       PRINTING
    RECORDS       REDIRECT       SAVESCRN         SCREEN         SCROLL
    SORTING          SOUND        STREAMS        STRINGS       TEXTEDIT
   TEXTFILE       TEXTWNDW         TIMING            TSR       UNITINFO
    WIN-OS2

The SWAG Reader and *.SWG files are contained in various archives (ZIP204) :

SWAG.ZIP     - Contains READER.EXE and Information files.
SWAGA-C.ZIP  - Contains ANSI through CURSOR
SWAGD-F.ZIP  - Contains DATATYPE through FINDREPL
SWAGG-M.ZIP  - Contains GRAPHICS through MOUSE
SWAGN-R.ZIP  - Contains NETWORK through REDIRECT
SWAGS-Z.ZIP  - Contains SAVESCRN through WIN-OS2
ALLSWAGS.ZIP - Contains ALL SWAG packets PLUS READER.EXE (LOTS of bytes !!)

These packages will updated approximately every 90 days, as more "snipetts"
are collected.  Each update will  be provided in  a "stand-alone" EXE  file
that will automatically insert the  new material to the existing libraries.
These  update packages  will be  distributed the  LAST week  of each of the
following months, and will be named as :

                        FEBRUARY   -    SWAGYY02.ZIP
                        MAY        -    SWAGYY05.ZIP
                        AUGUST     -    SWAGYY08.ZIP
                        NOVEMBER   -    SWAGYY11.ZIP

Each  file  will  be  named  using  the  year  (YY) and month (2,5,8,11) of
distribution.

We estimate that there eventually will be over 3000 of these covering EVERY
POSSIBLE aspect of PASCAL.

Enjoy and GOOD PROGRAMMING !!!
