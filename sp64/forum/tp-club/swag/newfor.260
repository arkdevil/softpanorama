Please read the READER.DOC file for  a complete explanation of the features
of this version of the READER.

The changes made to the READER.EXE for version 2.6, released on 2/26/94 are
as follows :

1. GREP  function (F2) will  search for ALL  snipets since the  last update
just by  press <ENTER> on  GREP prompt (EMPTY  search string). The  program
knows the LAST release date, and all items since then will be returned.

2. Made the  program completly DESQVIEW, WINDOWS 3.x,  OS2.x aware. Changed
so that time slices are given back properly under these operating systems.

3. Added the BBSADDS=YES/NO switch to the READER.INI file to allow users to
disable the  BBS adds from displaying  at the top line  of the program. See
the DOCS under READER INI FILE.

4. Added the ability to read a  .SWG package from the DOS commandline. User
enters READER somename.SWG and ONLY that package will be displayed.

5. Added the GREEN and MAGENTA Colors to the colors choices table.

6. Added SHELL TO DOS using the CTRL[S] keys.

7.  Added  the  PLUS(+)  and  SPACEBAR  for  NEXT  snipet, and MINUS(-) for
PREVIOUS in the "snipet" window to be compatible with most QWK readers.

8. Fixed  the F5 key  so that it  will show stats  from any position. There
MUST be swag files in the current directory.

9. Fixed other slight bugs and reported problems.
