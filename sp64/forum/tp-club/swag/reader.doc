INTRODUCTION
------------

SWAG (SourceWare Archival Group) is a collection of source code and program
examples for the PASCAL programming language. The material has been donated
by  various  PASCAL  programmers  from  around  the  world,  who  desire to
contribute to the advancement of  one of the greatest programming languages
there is.  MANY THANKS to all  who have contributed. As  such, NO CHARGE OF
ANY KIND IS PERMITTED FOR THIS WORK.

The material has been collected from various network conferences worldwide,
and organized  according to subject.  New material is  added quarterly, and
new SWAG  packets are available  from various BBS  sources on a  FIRST call
basis. See BBS.TXT for current support sites and how your BBS can join.

GETTING STARTED
----------------

The program READER.EXE is a executable program that will allow you to read,
extract or print the contents of  SWAG packets. These packets are organized
according to subject, with each one containing a number of PASCAL "snipets"
on that subject. In the rest of this document, I'll refer to the program as
"READER".

The SWAG packets should be placed ALL together in a directory on your disk.
It is recommended that you create a single directory named '\SWAG'. You can
use the DOS command :

                            mkdir c:\swag

Unpack  the distribution  archives and  place  all  of the  files with  the
extension of "*.SWG" in this directory along with READER.EXE.

USING THE READER
----------------

Using the  reader is really very  simple. Just execute it,  and you will be
presented with a  directory of all of the .SWG  files in the directory that
READER is  located in. If you  have .SWG files elsewhere  on your disk, you
can move around the disk to find them by selecting the ".." file which will
take you to the  PARENT directory. Use the HOME, END and  the arrow keys to
maneuver around.

ALSO,

The directory window  is search key sensitive. This means  that if you have
.SWG files  or directories listed in  the directory box, you  can just type
the name of the file you want.  For example, pressing 'A' will place you at
the first  entry starting with  'A'. Press 'N',  and you will  jump the the
entry with 'AN...'  if you have one. If  NOT, you will jump the  first file
starting with the letter 'N'.

At the bottom  of the screen you will notice  a menu indicating some cursor
and function keys :

                        F2 - GREP
                        F5 - Toggle STATS

                        <ENTER> - GO
                        ESC - QUIT

F2 calls  the GREP (search)  function. This is  a VERY POWERFUL  and useful
function, but  in order to  use this function,  you MUST have  at least ONE
.SWG file  in the directory  box, and it  MUST be highlighted  !! Place the
cursor any one of the .SWG files,  and press F2. You will be presented with
a prompt window :

Enter a string  to search for. You may enter  MULTIPLE items separated by a
semicolon  (;). Additionally,  you can  also include  a date  in the format
MM/DD/YY, and ONLY  records AFTER this date will be  included. If you enter
JUST  the date,  ALL SWAG  snipets AFTER  this date  will be  included. For
example,  entering CURSOR;ANSI;CRT;05/08/93  would search  the SWAG packets
for  matches for  CURSOR, ANSI  and CRT  occurring AFTER 05/08/93. Entering
JUST 05/08/93  at the prompt  would bring back  ALL snipets AFTER  05/08/93
REGARDLESS of the subject.

                                !!! NEW  !!!

Entry  an empty  string as  the search  string, and  READER will return all
snipets since the LAST SWAG release.

READER will  search ALL of  the SWAG packets  in the CURRENT  directory for
matches  based on  your criteria.  A processing  box will  appear, and  all
occurrences of your  search string(s) or date matches will  be written to a
NEW SWAG file.  Initially, this file is named GREPSWAG.SWG,  and will be in
the current  directory. Upon completion of  this GREP process, you  will be
asked for the  file name. Enter any name AND  directory you choose, and the
file will be  RENAMED and moved to that directory.  This process allows you
to  create  SWAG  files  containing  ANY  combination  of material that you
please.

You can ALSO search JUST the HEADER  of the SWAG snipet. Just enter a tilde
(~) character  as the FIRST character  on the search line.  For instance to
find all snipets by GAYLE DAVIS, you would enter ~GAYLE DAVIS on the search
line. ONLY  the header of snipets  is searched for matches.  This a way you
can look at all snipets by a certain contributor. You can also use multiple
search criteria  here. For instance, ~GAYLE  DAVIS;GUY MCLOUGHLIN;JOE BLOW;
would bring back  everything for each of these  persons. This search method
is VERY fast as on the headers have to be read.

F5 toggles the STATS function. In order  for this to work, you MUST have at
least ONE  .SWG file in  the directory box,  and it MUST  be highlighted !!
Place  the cursor  any one  of the  .SWG files,  and press  F5. You will be
presented with an  EXPANDED directory list showing the  description of each
.SWG file and the number of snipets in each.


VIEWING, EXTRACTING, PRINTING SWAG SNIPETS
------------------------------------------

Once you have  some .SWG files in the directory  box, press <ENTER> and the
package will be read and you be able to manage the SWAG snipets.

You will be  presented with a list of  all of the snipets contained  in the
package with descriptions for each.

At the bottom of the screen, will be the following menu.

43/50 LINE VIDEO
----------------

You will have the capability of using 43/50 line screens if you have EGA or
better.  The  option  can  be  found  in  the  OPTIONS  menu  (F3).  It  is
automatically  disabled if  the user  doesn't have  the capability.  Select
SCREENLINES, and if you have an EGA/VGA, you'll get 43/50 line mode.

COLORS
------

To be quite  honest, the whole business of allowing  users to change colors
is quite a  problem. It adds a lot  of code to the program,  and more often
than not, it is used only once  by the user. Therefore, the color selection
if VERY limited.

There are four  color group choices available. LIGHTGRAY,  BLUE, CYAN, RED,
GREEN and MAGENTA. Select one that you find pleasing. This will be disabled
on monochrome monitors.

DOS SHELL
---------

You can shell  out to DOS from within  the READER. This ability is  here on
the OPTIONS  menu. You can  ALSO do  this  at ANYTIME by  using CTRL[S] key
sequence.

SORTING
-------

ALT S on the main selection window  brings up the SORT box. The snipets can
be sorted by :

                        ┌────────────────────────────┐
                        │                            │

                        │                            │
                        │         C - CONFERENCE     │
                        │         N - NUMBER         │
                        │         T - TO             │
                        │         F - FROM           │
                        │         S - SUBJECT        │
                        │                            │
                        └────────────────────────────┘


TAGGING ITEMS
-------------

Snipets can be tagged by using the SPACEBAR. SPACEBAR tag can be turned OFF
in the OPTIONS menu.  ALL items can be tagged with ALT  T and untagged with
ALT U. Tagged items can be written to a file with F4.


READING SNIPETS
---------------

Pressing <ENTER> on any of the snipets  allows it to be reviewed. You'll be
presented with the  "snipet" screen and you can use  the menu at the bottom
of the screen :

┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ▀ Next(+) ▀ preV(-)  ▀ Mark  ▀ Find  ▀ Extract  ▀ Print  ▀ ESC-Quit    │
│ ▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄  ▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄  ▄▄▄▄▄▄  ▄▄▄▄▄▄  ▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄  ▄▄▄▄▄▄▄  ▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄   │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

To accommodate  many of the  QWK reader  users  out there, you  can use the
PLUS(+) and  MINUS(-) keys to  display the NEXT  or PREVIOUS snipet  OR the
SPACEBAR key will display the NEXT  snipet. You can Mark, Find, Extract, or
Print snipets. If  you have a mouse, you can  select any of these functions
by using the LEFT button on any item.


EXTRACTING SNIPETS
------------------

Snipets can be  extract to an ASCII file by  selecting and pressing the 'E'
key. Enter  the filename, and  the data  with  be written out.  If the file
selected is already on  your disk, you will be asked if  you want to APPEND
or OVERWRITE.

WRITING TAGGED SNIPETS
----------------------

Once you  have tagged a  group of snipets,  you can write  them to an ASCII
file using F4. Enter  the filename, and if it exists, you  will be asked if
you want  to APPEND or OVERWRITE.  All of the tagged  items will be written
sequentially.

FINDING TEXT IN SNIPETS
-----------------------

You  can  use  the  (F)ind  command  to  find  text located within the SWAG
snipets. This works JUST LIKE the BORLAND  PASCAL IDE. You can ALSO use the
^Q^F  key sequence  to activate  this function.  Just as  with the  IDE, ^L
displays the NEXT find.

SWAG SNIPETS MARKED WITH CHECKMARK
----------------------------------

If you  see snipets with a  CHECKMARK (#251) beside them,  this indicates a
NEW item  added since the LAST  update. The READER.EXE keeps  track of this
and  marks  these  automatically.  The  checkmark  is  only  there for your
reference.

THE READER INI FILE
-------------------

Thre READER  program keeps several of  its program defaults in  an INI file
(simple ASCII) in the same directory  as READER.EXE. Contained in this file
are several items that you can change  to affect the way the program works.
The lines in this file have the format LABEL=VALUE.

The file looks like this :

         COLOR=LIGHTGRAY       (LIGHTGRAY,BLUE,CYAN,RED,GREEN,MAGENTA)
         43/50=NO              (YES or NO)
         SORT=n                (nUMBER,fROM,tO,sUBJECT,cONFERENCE)
         SWAGDIR=\SWAG\FILES\  (Wherever you keep them)
         SWAGADDS=YES          (Display those BBS adds at the top (YES/NO)

You can change this file using any  word processor. I think that you'll get
the idea.


COMMAND LINE USAGE
------------------

Starting with  this version of the  READER, individual SWAG packets  can be
read  from  the  DOS  command  line.  Simple  type READER swagfilename. For
example, you can look at all of the snipets in ANSI.SWG by typing :

                           READER ANSI.SWG <ENTER>

You don't really need to enter the  extension, as the READER will append it
for you.  If the .SWG  files are not  in the current  directory READER will
look for them somewhere on your current PATH.

XX3402 ENCODED FILES
--------------------

Many  of the  SWAG snipets  contain code  that has  been encoded  using Guy
Mcloughlin's XX3402  encoder. This has  been done due  to the necessity  to
include OBJ  code in the snipet,  and this allows us  a way to do  it. What
this fine  program does is to  create an ASCII encoded  file containing the
BINARY data.  You need to  "CUT" these items  from the snipet,  giving it a
unique name, and  decode it using XX3402. It's really  an easy thing to do.
Once you cut your file out, just execute from the DOS command line :

                        XX3402 d yourfilename

Magically, the file  needed to compile the snipet will  appear !! It's just
that easy. See the file included  with the SWAG distribution XX3402.ZIP for
complete instructions, and  the COMPLETE SOURCE CODE to  this fine program.
Thanks GUY for letting us use XX3402 for SWAG.

We  hope that  you find  the READER   easy to  use, and  the SWAG  material
valuable in development of your PASCAL programs.

ENJOY !!!!! and GOOD PROGRAMMING !!!
