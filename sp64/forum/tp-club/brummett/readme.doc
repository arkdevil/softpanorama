Section 1 - Description

These two units provide memory management extensions to the memory functions
of Turbo Pascal. The NewMem unit provides a greater control over
fragmentation than GetMem and FreeMem. The NewMem2 unit extends things
further by providing a form of virtual memory.


Section 2 - Legal Stuff

READ THIS! IT'S IMPORTANT!

These units come with no warranties whatsoever. Although they work for me,
there's no way I can test this software under every possible circumstance
and configutation. Sources are provided so you can look throught and make
sure there's no routine that re-formats your hard drive or anything like
that.

These units are released as "freeware." The copyrights are still held by
the author. They are provided in the hopes they will be useful to someone.
You may use, copy, and distribute them freely as long as no changes are
made to any of the files and no fee is charged for the files.

All software written with these units may be distributed or sold without
restriction. I do ask, however, that you mention the use of the unit(s) in
your program or documentation.

Even though this code is provided as freeware, I certainly won't turn down
any donations you send (My address is listed at the end of this document).
Also, if you find this at all usefull, drop me a line telling what you
plan on doing with it so I can enhance things even more. It'll also tell
me it's worth working on further.


Section 3 - Files

Here's the list of files you should have gotten in this archive:
  README.DOC   - This file
  NEWMEM.DOC   - Documentation for the newmem unit
  NEWMEM.PAS   - Source code to the newmem unit
  MEMTEST.PAS  - Sample source on how to use the newmem unit
  NEWMEM2.DOC  - Documentation for the newmem2 unit
  NEWMEM2.PAS  - Source code to the newmem2 unit
  MEMTEST2.PAS - Sample source on how to use the newmem2 unit

I wrote the source with Turbo Pascal 7.0, but it should work with any
recent version.
