Abstract:  Programmers of Microsoft Windows applications such as Word for
           Windows (WFW) can streamline the process by utilizing some of
           Windows' dynamic link libraries (DLL) in their routines. DLLs,
           which are collections of named subroutines and functions, are
           brought into Windows only when a service is needed by an
           application; they are offloaded when no longer needed. WFW 2.0
           contains a powerful programming language called WordBasic,
           which can be used to customize nearly every aspect of the
           program. When coupled with DLLs, Windows' basic services may
           be controlled directly from the application. The basic process
           for using WordBasic to customize aspects of WFW is presented,
           complete with examples of data structures, which are at the
           heart of most Windows functions.

It shouldn't surprise anyone to learn that shrink-wrapped applications
are more powerful than ever before--giving users and developers alike
tremendous opportunities to increase productivity through customization.
In this issue, we inaugurate a new column called Extending Your Apps that
reflects the sophistication of applications that contain powerful
application development environments in their own right. In this space,
we'll cover a wide variety of topics that will let you extend your own
apps--LBLDDE, OLE, REXX, WordBasic, VBA, OpenDoc--a veritable alphabet
soup of techniques to get the most from your applications. First, we'll
show you how to extend WordBasic's power programming language to use
Windows' Common Dialog dynamic link library (DLL) file.

Windows programming isn't just for C and PASCAL programmers anymore. If
you're a Word for Windows 2.0 user, you've already got a powerful
programming language called WordBasic built right into your word
processor. You can use WordBasic to customize virtually every aspect of
Word for Windows: building new commands, replacing built-in functions,
and interacting with users through custom dialog boxes. You can even use
it to tap directly into and control Windows' basic services by accessing
Windows DLLs.

A dynamic link library is just a collection of named functions and
subroutines that provides certain services to Windows applications. They
are called dynamic because they are brought into Windows only when an
application requests a service and unloaded when they are no longer
needed. Windows and Windows applications use DLLs extensively to share
functions and manage memory resources. In fact, most of Windows itself is
actually contained within three dynamic link library files: USER, KERNEL,
and Graphics Device Interface (GDI), which collectively form the Windows
application programming interface (API).

Accessing DLLs lets you perform a lot of useful operations that ordinary
WordBasic commands can't handle, such as determining whether another
application is running, finding the screen resolution, getting the DOS
environment string, or even deciding if Program Manager is your default
shell. Other examples of operations can be found in PSS.DOC, a sample
file that comes with Word for Windows. Conspicuous by their absence from
PSS.DOC, however, are WordBasic examples that use the functions in
Windows 3.1's Common Dialog DLL (COMMDLG.DLL). This dynamic link library
is responsible for helping Windows and Windows applications to present a
common, familiar user interface; it provides standard dialog boxes for
such fundamental interface operations as file selection, font selection,
color selection, search-and-replace, and printer control.

Unfortunately for WordBasic programmers, COMMDLG relies on data
structures, which are programming constructs used by advanced programming
languages to group related variables into a single block of memory. In
languages such as C, Pascal, and Microsoft Visual Basic, the declaration
of a data structure provides a full listing of the members (or variables)
located within a memory block and their data types. This declaration lets
you access each member simply by using its name, and the programming
environment uses the declaration listing to figure out where that member
is located in the memory block.

WordBasic and most other application macro languages don't know how to
work with data structures. But we don't have to let this limitation stop
us. All we need to do is find a way to allow WordBasic to access
individual members of a data structure, either to set it to a value or to
return its value to WordBasic. Our DLL ACCES.DLL helper DLL (which you
can download from PC MagNet, along with the sample macros from this
article) provides the solution to this problem; it is WordBasic's gateway
to the members of the data structure.

Combine this with a few WordBasic convenience routines that help
WordBasic reserve a memory block of the correct size, add a few
organizational concepts, and you'll be able to use almost any DLL
functions that require data structures. I'll illustrate the use of these
routines and concepts by means of a few sample macros that use the
COMMDLG interface to enhance Word for Windows' FileOpen and FileSaveAs
commands. But you can use similar techniques with any programming
environment that can use DLLs; a category that includes the macro
languages from Ami Pro, Microsoft Excel, and even personal information
managers such as PackRat!

WHY REPLACE FILEOPEN?

One of Word for Windows' most serious file-handling deficiencies is its
inability to start the FileOpen dialog box with a filespec pattern other
than the default patterns of *.DOC (for Word files), *.DOT (for Word
template files), *.RTF (for rich text format files), or *.TXT (for text
files). As a direct result of this, many people simply use the .DOC
extension, keeping track of the type of document using subdirectories or
the first eight characters of the filename. Life would be much simpler,
however, if you could use the file extension in order to categorize your
documents by type. Imagine if all your contracts were named *.CNT,
letters *.LET, invoices *.INV, and so on, and if you could include these
extensions in the pattern list box in your file-selection dialog boxes,
as shown in Figure 1.

Although you can build custom dialog boxes in WordBasic, the FileOpen
dialog box is a bit more complex to manage, because it needs to access
the file system to build up its lists of drives, directories, and
filenames. The default WinWord FileOpen dialog box does this by using
built-in file-selection dialog boxes, but you can use the prebuilt dialog
boxes supplied by COMMDLG.DLL. With this DLL file, all you have to do is
provide some details, such as what directory to use, what type of files
to display, and what the title bar should say.

The COMMDLG interface functions are designed to be flexible, providing a
wide range of options to satisfy the needs of a great variety of possible
Windows applications. Rather than using separate function arguments for
the different options, each COMMDLG function uses a single argument,
which represents a data structure that packages all the options and all
the function results into a single, functional unit. Provided that both
the calling program and the COMMDLG function are in agreement on the
definition of a data structure, you can access this unit in a consistent
manner.

Normally, the procedure for doing this is relatively straightforward.
Before calling the COMMDLG function, the calling program creates the data
structure and sets some or all the members of the data structure for use
as input to the function. And before returning, the COMMDLG function sets
some or all the member variables to return results to the caller.

Since WordBasic has no concept of data structures, it can't be used to
access these COMMDLG functions directly. But luckily, these and most
other DLL functions use only the addresses--or memory locations--of data
structures as function arguments. These addresses are represented as long
integers. (This is commonly known as pass by reference--when the address,
not the actual value, of a variable is given to the function.) A
WordBasic macro, therefore, can access these functions indirectly by
declaring a data structure as type Long then using the structure's
address to locate its members.

Once WordBasic locates the data member, it just needs a bit of help
interpreting the data that's there. That's where DLLACCES.DLL comes in.
DLLACCES is a custom collection of functions that translates data at
specified memory locations to and from data types that WordBasic
understands: integer, long, double, and string. In essence, you can tell
DLLACCES to do something like "get me the long integer value of the
second data member of this structure," or "set the fifth data member of
this structure to the byte value 16, but I'm passing you an integer
(since WordBasic does not have a Byte type)."

To use the DLLACCES.DLL functions, you need some understanding of how
data structures are stored in memory. Figure 2 shows a memory block
containing the data structure called MyStruct, whose C-language
definition is to the left in the figure. This data structure contains
five members: one long integer, two integers, one string, and one
double-precision number. The rectangular blocks represent the memory each
variable occupies. The first variable--a long integer--uses 4 bytes, the
next two--both integers--use 2 bytes each, var4--the string--uses 4
bytes, and the double-precision variable uses 8 bytes.

The total size of the structure is 20 bytes. Thus, in order to find the
location of any variable in the structure from the beginning of its
memory block, just add up the sizes, in bytes, of all the variables that
come before it. That's what the labels to the left of each block
represent: the offset of each variable from the beginning of the
structure. A programming environment that supports data structures can
automatically calculate the offset for each data member and convert the
bytes located there to the value of the correct data type. But WordBasic
can't do this, so you must calculate the memory offset of each data
member manually, and then use the DLLACCES functions to convert the data
into a form that WordBasic can handle.

THE DLLACCES.DLL FILE

Let's take a look at some examples of how to use the DLLACCES functions
with the sample data structure MyStruct, shown in Figure 2. The assigning
of values to bytes, long integers, floating-point numbers,
double-precision numbers, and string variables in WordBasic is
accomplished by means of a series of DA_Set functions. (The exact syntax
of which you'll find in DLLACCES.DOC, which documents the entire suite of
DLLACCES functions and gives detailed instructions for calculating these
address offsets.)

Say, for instance, that you have the memory location of a MyStruct data
structure stored in a variable called lpStruct, and you want to set its
third member (var3) to the value 48. Since this value is an integer
value, you'd use the DLLACCES function that sets integer variables
(DA_SetInt), providing the function with the memory location of the data
structure, the offset of the data member you're interested in (in this
case, 6 bytes), and the value you want to assign to the data member:

var3Offset = 6 result = DA_SetInt(lpStruct,
var3Offset, 48)

The result of the function is a status flag indicating whether the
attempt to set the value of the variable has succeeded or failed. Note
that you don't really need to use var3Offset (which stores the offset
location of var3) to call the DA_SetInt function. But using variables to
represent the offset values can help you document the members of a data
structure in your code and make your code more readable.

DLLACCES also offers a similar set of DA_Get functions to help you
retrieve the values of data members. For example, to get the value of
var1 (a long integer), you would use DA_GetLong. Again, you supply the
address of the data structure and the offset of the data member (0 in
this case, since var1 is the first member of the data structure):

var1Offset = 0
var1Value = DA_GetLong(lpStruct,

var1Offset)

DA_GetLong locates the data member, translates the data at the memory
location to a long integer, and places the value in var1Value.

Accessing a string member in a data structure is just as easy, but it's
worth a brief discussion. As the example in Figure 2 suggests, the data
in the var4 data member is really only the address of a string: The
actual character data is stored outside the data structure. This format
allows the string to be of any length without requiring you to reserve
space in the structure itself. Fortunately, WordBasic strings also work
in this manner: They use the addresses of the actual data. Thus, getting
the string value of the var4 data member is as simple as getting the
values of other members:

var4Offset = 8
var4Val$ = DA_GetString$(lpStruct,

var4Offset)

One thing to be aware of is that many DLL functions return string results
in the data structure, but the functions do not allocate memory for the
strings themselves. Rather, the functions expect the calling routine to
reserve memory buffers for each string and to assign the memory address
of each buffer to the appropriate data member of the structure.

Before we continue, a note of caution is in order. Accessing DLLs makes
WordBasic both powerful and dangerous. Any actions you initiate through a
DLL take place outside the normal error-trapping facilities of the
WordBasic environment. If you use the DLL incorrectly, you can easily
crash Windows. So save your work often, and to prevent losing any
changes, always save your work before you test your macro. And once your
program is debugged, test it out on several different Windows machines
before releasing it to other users.

ORGANIZING THE MACROS

We can make the whole process of creating and manipulating data
structures much easier by combining the setting up of data structures the
DLL calls into a single WordBasic interface function. In fact, it is
often handy to combine such interface functions and other necessary
routines into a single macro library, which in WordBasic terms is simply
a macro whose sole purpose is to supply routines for use by other macros.
By putting common routines into a macro library, you allow one or more
macros to use the routines without having to copy them over and over.

The new capabilities that we want to add to the FileOpen and FileSaveAs
dialog boxes are organized into three macros. CommLib is a macro library
containing the GetFileDlg$ interface function, which is responsible for
doing all the work in calling COMMDLG file-selection functions, plus a
few convenience routines for handling memory allocation. The other two
macros, NewFileOpen and NewFileSaveAs, are simply replacements for
WordBasic's FileOpen and FileSaveAs commands, respectively. Both of these
macros are relatively simple, because they rely heavily on the functions
in the CommLib macro library.

GetFileDlg$ is the most important function in CommLib. This function's
role is to make COMMDLG's GetOpenFileName, GetSaveFileName, and the data
structure they both use--OPENFILENAME--easier for us to use. By calling
the GetFileDlg$ interface function, macros do not need to be aware of the
messy details of the COMMDLG functions--they only need to pass a few
standard WordBasic strings and numbers to GetFileDlg$.

The syntax for using GetFileDlg$ from other macros is

fname$ = CommLib.GetFileDlg$
(OpenOrSave, dir$, fname$,
filt$, title$, flags)

Note that you use the MacroName.FunctionName (arguments. . .) calling
syntax to call GetFileDlg$ from a macro outside the CommLib macro
library. OpenOrSave indicates which of the COMMDLG functions to use: 0
for GetOpenFileName and 1 for GetSaveFileName. The rest of the arguments
let you access a few of the many members of the OPENFILENAME data
structure. In this particular example, you choose the starting directory
(dir$), the required filename (fname$), the filespec filter (filt$), the
title-bar caption (title$), and the flags that refine the behavior of the
file-selection dialog box (flags). The return value fname$ either
contains the full pathname of the file that the user selected or else
contains an empty string indicating that the user has clicked on the
Cancel button.

Supplying the starting directory and filename to the function is a rather
straightforward process, but setting up the file-type filter string and
defining the flags can be a bit tricky. Each file type is described by
two components: the description and the file pattern. To build the filter
string, you need to concatenate all the component pairs, separating each
component with the pipe character (|). Then store the resultant string in
global memory using BuildLPString--one of the convenience routines in the
CommLib macro library. COMMDLG uses the ASCII NUL (0) character as a
separator for the filter string, but BuildLPString translates the pipe
characters to NUL characters before storing the string in global memory.

The file types used for the File Open dialog box in Figure 1, for
instance, are Contracts (*.cnt), Letters (*.let), Invoices (*.inv), and
All Files (*.*). These result in the filter string

filt$ = "Contracts (*.cnt)|*.cnt
|Letters (*.let)|*.let|Invoices
(*.inv)|*.inv|All Files (*.*)|*.*"

The flags argument refines the behavior of the file-selection dialog
boxes. For example, if you set the OFN_FILEMUSTEXIST flag, COMMDLG will
pop up a warning if the user selects an invalid filename. You can use
other flags in order to prevent the changing of directories, prevent the
selection of existing files, and even allow selection of multiple files.
Each flag is represented by a numeric value, which you must define in
your WordBasic code.

Some of the more useful flags are

OFN_READONLY = 1
OFN_OVERWRITEPROTECT = 2
OFN_NOCHANGEDIR = 8
OFN_SHOWHELP = 16
OFN_MULTISELECT = 512
OFN_PATHMUSTEXIST = 2048
OFN_FILEMUSTEXIST = 4096

To use several flags at the same time, just add the values together. Our
NewFileOpen macro, for instance, uses

flags = OFN_PATHMUSTEXIST +

OFN_FILENMUSTEXIST

to force the user to choose a file that already exists.

GETFILEDLG$ IN DETAIL

Although GetFileDlg$ specifically deals with accessing the
GetOpenFileName and GetSaveFileName functions of COMMDLG, the procedure
it uses is applicable whenever you deal with data structures and DLLs.
The full code listing of the GetFileDlg$ and the other functions in the
CommLib macro library is in DLLACCES.DOC, and the following discussion
will attempt to give you an overview.

If you intend to take advantage of DLL functions, your first step in the
WordBasic macro is to declare those DLL functions used by the routines
(functions and subroutines) in the WordBasic macro. In the case of
CommLib macro library, GetFileDlg$ uses functions in the DLLACCES library
and the COMMDLG library (GetOpenFileName and GetSaveFileName). Windows
API functions and DLL functions are generally described in C or Visual
Basic, but it's not too hard to translate them into WordBasic. The
WordBasic declaration for the GetOpenFileName function, for instance, is

Declare Function GetOpenFileName
Lib "COMMDLG.DLL"(lpofn As Long)
As Integer

This tells WordBasic that GetOpenFileName is a function in the
COMMDLG.DLL DLL library, that it returns an integer, and that it takes a
single long integer argument, which represents the address of an
OPENFILENAME data structure. In general, any argument that is the address
of a data structure must be declared as a long integer. You'll use this
long integer in conjunction with the DLLACCES.DLL functions to access the
individual members of the data structure.

Though not strictly necessary, defining each member variable's address
offset at the head of the interface routine is also a good idea. By doing
this, we not only document the data structure, but we also make the code
more readable when the time comes to set and retrieve the values of the
members. To determine the offsets, take a look at the documentation for
the OPENFILENAME data structure shown in Figure 3. The size (in bytes) of
each variable is noted in parentheses after its name.

The final preparatory step is to allocate a memory block of the proper
size to accommodate those members of the COMMDLG data structure that we
plan to use in our macros. Though it is possible to create a variable of
arbitrary size within WordBasic itself (by defining it as a string
variable), the program sometimes behaves strangely if you directly
manipulate this memory in an attempt to make it look like a data
structure. Therefore, you're much better off managing memory yourself by
using Windows global memory (memory that is available to all Windows
applications) for your data structures.

Working with global memory requires the use of Windows API functions, but
I've written a number of convenience routines (which won't be described
in too much detail here for reasons of space) to help your macros
interface with these functions. The AllocVariable convenience routine
lets you reserve a global-memory block of the size (in bytes) that you
request, BuildLPString allocates global memory for individual string
members of data structures, and FreeVariable releases the global memory
allocated by both functions. All are stored in the CommLib macro library
along with GetFileDlg$.

Unlike programming languages that support data structures, WordBasic
cannot automatically calculate the size of a data structure. So before
you can reserve memory for a data structure, you must first add up the
size of all the data members (in this case, 72 bytes). You then pass this
size to the AllocVariable convenience routine, which returns two values
that describe the global memory to Windows and Windows applications--the
unique memory ID (or handle) for the block, and its actual location in
memory. For example:

lStructSize = 72
hStruct = 0 : lpStruct =

AllocVariable(lStructSize,

hStruct)

After the call to AllocVariable, the variable lpStruct contains the
address (location) of the data structure, while the variable hStruct
contains a unique ID of the memory block. Though both variables refer to
the same chunk of memory, they are used for different purposes. You need
the address in lpStruct in order to access the data structure in global
memory and to pass it as an argument to the DLLACCES and COMMDLG
functions, but you need the handle in hStruct to free up the memory block
(using the FreeVariable convenience function) when you're finished.

One quirk of AllocVariable is that it requires the memory-handle variable
(hStruct, in this case) to exist before you call it, for reasons too
obscure to explain here. The code fragment above reflects this
requirement; it creates hStruct and assigns it a value of 0 before
calling the AllocVariable function.

INITIALIZING THE DATA STRUCTURE

Once these preparatory steps have been completed, the GetFileDlg$
interface function then proceeds to use DLLACCES's DA_Set functions to
initialize those members of the OPENFILENAME structure that we plan to
use as input to COMMDLG's GetOpenFileName and GetSaveFileName functions.
This is the most lengthy and important section of the GetFileDlg$
interface function (see Figure 4). When building your own interface
functions, you'll need to consult the documentation for the DLL to
determine which members you should set before calling the DLL and which
members to examine after calling the DLL.

As we noted above, GetFileDlg$ allows the calling program to specify the
values of just five of the members of OPENFILENAME: the initial
directory, the initial filename, the filespec filter string, the
title-bar caption, and the flags. In addition to transferring these
values to the appropriate places in the data structure, we also need to
set up data members that represent the size of the data structure and the
ID of the active window, as required by the GetOpenFileName and
GetSaveFileName functions. In addition, we also need to preallocate
memory to hold the filename and file title that the COMMDLG functions
will return.

The following code fragment shows how the function sets the first two
members of the OPENFILENAME structure:

r=DA_SetLong(lpStruct,

lStructSizeOff, lStructSize)
hWnd = GetActiveWindow

r=DA_SetInt(lpStruct,

hwndOwnerOff, hWnd)

This routine uses the DLLACCES DA_SetLong function to assign the long
integer value representing the size of the structure (lStructSize) to the
data-structure member at the offset stored in the variable
lStructSizeOff. It then uses DA_SetInt to assign the integer value
representing the handle of the active window hWnd to the member at the
offset stored in the variable hwndOwnerOff.

Handling string members of data structures is somewhat different.
Remember that the data structure stores only the address of a memory
buffer that contains the string, not the string data itself. The
BuildLPString convenience routine is used to reserve buffers in global
memory to hold the contents of each string variable and then assigns the
address of each buffer to the appropriate member of the data structure.

BuildLPString's syntax is similar to AllocVariable's--it returns the
location and the handle of the allocated global-memory block. The
following two lines, for example, are used to initialize the filter
string member of the OPENFILENAME structure by setting it to the string
variable filt$:

hstrFilter = 0 : lpstr =
BuildLPString(filt$, hstrFilter)

r=DA_SetLong(lpStruct,

lpstrFilterOff, lpstr)

BuildLPString builds the string in global memory and then returns the
address (lpstr) and the memory handle (hstrFilter). The DA_SetLong
function initializes the filter string member by using the memory address
of the data structure (lpStruct), the offset of the filter string member
(lpstrFilterOff), and the memory address of the string (lpstr). Note that
you'll use the memory-block handle (hstrFilter) to free up the memory
block when you're finished.

BuildLPString also performs another service: It converts all pipe
characters () in the input string to a NUL character (ASCII 0) before
storing it in global memory. The GetOpenFileName and GetSaveFileName
functions expect each component of the filter to be separated by a NUL
character, but since these are difficult to enter in WordBasic,
BuildString allows the filter input string to use the pipe character
instead.

You can use BuildLPString in conjunction with the WordBasic String$()
command to preallocate memory for string data members that you expect to
receive results from the COMMDLG functions. To reserve memory for the
selected filename, the following lines of code allocate a global-memory
block of at least 256 bytes, assign the memory location to the data
member at the offset stored in lpstrFileOff, and assign the size of the
memory block of the member at the offset stored in nMaxFileOff. (This
prevents the COMMDLG functions from returning strings longer than this
value.)

hstrFile = 0 : lpstrFile =
BuildLPString(fname$ +
String$(256, 0), hstrFile)
r = DA_SetLong(lpStruct,
lpstrFileOff, lpstrFile)
r = DA_SetLong(lpStruct,
nMaxFileOff, 256)

Because this filename data member (at the lpstrFileOff offset) can also
be used as the input to set the initial filename displayed in the
file-selection dialog box, simply add the initial filename fname$ in
front of the 256-byte string buffer--created by the WordBasic
String$(256, 0) function call.

CALLING AND EXITING

Once we've done the complex job of setting up the data structure, calling
the DLL function is almost anticlimactic: We just pass it the address of
the data structure:

If OpenOrSave = 0 Then
success = GetOpenFileName(lpStruct)

Else

success = GetSaveFileName(lpStruct)
End If
If success = 0 Then
Goto Bye
End If

The first argument to GetFileDlg$ is OpenOrSave, which allows the calling
program to choose which of the two COMMDLG file-selection functions
(GetOpenFileName or GetSaveFileName) to call. The selected COMMDLG
function pops up a file-selection dialog box like the one shown in Figure
1 and handles all the user interaction from here on. It stores
information (such as the name of the selected file and the status of the
Read Only checkbox) in members of the data structure before returning a
status. The status is then checked to see whether the call was
successful. If it wasn't, an empty string is returned to the calling
program.

Assuming the call to the COMMDLG function is successful, we can retrieve
the output data from the data structure using the DLLACCES DA_Get
functions. We are interested in only two values for the GetFileDlg$
interface routine: the selected filename and the flags (which are used to
check if the user clicked on the Read Only box).

f$ = DA_GetString$(lpStruct,
lpstrFileOff) flags = DA_GetLong(lpStruct,

FlagsOff)

The f$ string contains the name of the selected file, and flags is the
value of the flags data member.

The final step in the GetFileDlg$ interface function is to free all the
global memory used for the call to the COMMDLG function, including the
global-memory blocks for string variables that were allocated by
BuildLPString. Always free global memory when you no longer need it. If
you don't, Windows will eventually run out of memory, and you'll have to
restart WinWord or Windows.

The FreeVariable convenience routine is a handy way to perform this
necessary function. FreeVariable takes only one argument: the memory
handle of the block that was returned to you by AllocVariable or
BuildLPString. The Bye: label before the FreeVariable calls ensures that
all the memory is freed whenever the execution exits this function via
calls to Goto Bye:.

Bye:

FreeVariable(hTitle)

FreeVariable(hstrFileTitle)

One of the beauties of Word for Windows is configurability. Since all the
menu entries, toolbar buttons, and key assignments invoke WordBasic
commands, you can change the behavior of the program simply by replacing
these commands with your own custom macros. Thus, if we change the name
of the NewFileOpen macro mentioned above to the default name FileOpen,
executing the File Open command (either by clicking on the FileOpen tool
in the toolbar or by choosing File Open from the menu) will run our
replacement macro rather than the default command.

Since most of the work is performed by GetFileDlg$, the NewFileOpen macro
looks very simple (see Figure 5). It supplies the starting directory and
filenames, builds the filter string, specifies the characteristics of the
dialog box, and calls the GetFileDlg$ function with 0 as the first
argument. It then calls the WordBasic FileOpen command to open up the
selected file, choosing the ReadOnly option if GetFileDlg$ returned with
OFN_READONLY set.

The NewFileSaveAs macro is quite similar, except that it tells
GetFileDlg$ to access the COMMDLG function GetSaveFileName instead of
GetOpenFileName, and that it uses the OFN_OVERWRITEPROTECT flag to
prevent the user from inadvertently overwriting an existing file.
(NewFileOpen uses the OFN_FILEMUSTEXIST flag to allow reselection if the
user enters a nonexistent file.)

To try out these macros, start Word for Windows, open the file DLL
ACCES.DOC (included in the DLLACC.ZIP file that you download from PC
MagNet's Programming forum), and double-click on the line that reads
"Double-click here to install the CommLib library." This installs the
CommLib macro library into your global template (NORMAL.DOT), making its
routines available to all your macros. It also copies the DLLACCES.DLL to
your WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. (You can click on the corresponding
UnInstall sentence to reverse the process.)

Now double-click the sentence, "Double-click here to test New FileOpen."
You should see a file-selection dialog box like the one in Figure 1. Try
typing in a filename that does not exist and click on the OK button. The
COMMDLG function should pop up a warning box and ask you to try again.

To use the NewFileOpen macro as your normal FileOpen command, open the
NewFileOpen macro and copy the contents to your global FileOpen macro.
It's important that you make sure to change the filter string to match
the filespec patterns you wish to have. Copy the contents of the
NewFileSaveAs macro to your global FileSaveAs macro in order to use the
custom file-selection dialog box when you save a file.

CONCLUSION

As you can see, most of the work in calling DLL functions that use data
structures is in setting up the data structure itself--defining the
address offsets and assigning data to the structure members. The DLLACCES
helper functions and the global-memory convenience routines described
here can help out, leaving only simple tasks to be performed by the
command macro itself. With a little imagination, you should be able to
adapt these steps to develop your own interface routines.

When you feel comfortable with this step, you might want to try exploring
the remaining functions in COMMDLG. Each of these functions uses its own
custom data structure, documented in WIN31WH.HLP, the on-line help file
for the Windows 3.1 Software Development Kit. DLLACCES.DOC contains a
short tutorial that should help you convert this information into
WordBasic terms.

If you're on a Novell Network, you can move beyond the COMMDLG functions
and explore the NetWare API (NWNETAPI.DLL) functions. The NetWare API
also makes extensive use of data structures. As a first cut, try calling
the GetServerInformation function. It uses the FILE_SERV_INFO data
structures, which contain, among other items, the server name, the
NetWare version, and the number of connections in use. You can find the
Visual Basic documentation for the NetWare API functions on CompuServe in
the MSBASIC forum, Lib 6, in the file NIVB.ZIP.

This article gives just a glimpse of what you can accomplish when you use
DLLs and data structures. Half the fun is in finding the right DLL
functions to do your bidding. And whenever you must deal with data
structures, you can use the organizational tips presented here to make
DLL access routines more understandable and easier to use.

Title:     The WordBasic programming language.
             (Tutor)
Author:    Prosise, Jeff


Abstract:  Techniques for using the WordBasic programming language
           included in Microsoft Word for Windows (WinWord) are
           presented. WordBasic is one of the most powerful macro
           languages available; it is modeled after the familiar BASIC
           language and is an extensive application-specific programming
           platform. Microsoft unfortunately does not include full
           documentation for WordBasic in the Word package; users must
           order it separately. WordBasic is easy to learn if the user is
           familiar with structured dialects of BASIC; it uses similar
           syntax, handles variables the same way and supports most
           standard BASIC flow-control statements. The language has many
           statements and functions specific to WinWord. All macros are
           stored internally as WordBasic programs in WinWord, and users
           can create a macro using either a macro recorder or by
           directly editing statements in a window. The macro recorder
           converts users' keystrokes into WordBasic code that can be
           edited. A handful of macro names are reserved for special
           purposes. Sample macros that transpose letters, split the
           WinWord window vertically and change default key assignments
           are included.

Full Text:

Microsoft Word for Windows is one of the most powerful word processors on
the market. It's also one of the most flexible: The basic elements of its
user interface--elements that are cast in stone and hidden deep within
the bowels of most applications--can be modified to suit the needs of
individual users. Want to add a new menu item to the Tools menu? No
problem; just select Tools | Options | Menus and register the new menu
item. Care to change a key assignment or add a new button to the overhead
toolbar? That's no problem, either. In fact, WinWord puts so many
configuration options before you, there's virtually no end to the
remolding and reshaping that you can do.

But perhaps the most remarkable aspect of WinWord is its built-in
programming language, WordBasic. WordBasic is a powerful
application-specific development tool modeled after the BASIC language,
which is familiar to millions of PC users. It's an extensive programming
platform that provides indirect access to the Windows application
programming interface (API) functions and can even be used to effect
Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE). It is also the stuff macros are made of.
Every WinWord macro that you define is stored internally as one or more
WordBasic statements. If you've never used WordBasic, you're missing out
on one of Word for Windows' most potentially useful features.

Unfortunately, the Using WordBasic manual isn't included in the basic
WinWord package but must be ordered separately. The WinWord User's Guide
contains a scant 24 pages of information on WordBasic. As a result, the
majority of WinWord users have never used WordBasic directly. A number of
users probably aren't even aware that it exists. But it's there, and with
it an enterprising user can customize WinWord to his heart's delight and
even write dedicated mini-apps that exist only within the context of his
word processor.

THE BASICS OF WORDBASIC

If you're already familiar with modern (structured) dialects of the BASIC
programming language, then you can easily pick up WordBasic. The syntax
is very much the same. WordBasic supports most of the standard BASIC
flow-control statements (Goto, For-Next, If-Then-Else, Select Case, and
While-Wend), and it handles variables in exactly the same way as BASIC.
The chief difference between BASIC and WordBasic is that the latter
supports many statements and functions specific to WinWord. For example,
the CenterPara command centers a paragraph on the page, and DocSplit
splits the current document window into two panes. In all, WordBasic
supports about 500 different statements and functions. If you don't have
access to a copy of Using WordBasic, you can list all the commands that
WordBasic supports by selecting Help Index from WinWord's Help menu and
clicking WordBasic Programming Language. Click on a command name to get
syntactical help with that command, or click on WordBasic Cross Reference
to display a list of WordBasic command categories. You can also get
context-sensitive help inside the macro-editing window by pressing F1
while the cursor is positioned over a command.

WinWord stores all macros internally as WordBasic programs. There are two
ways to create a macro, and therefore two ways to create a WordBasic
program: by using WinWord's built-in macro recorder to record a series of
mouse and keyboard events, or by opening a macro-editing window and
directly entering the macro statements. To demonstrate the former
technique, select Record Macro from WinWord's Tools menu, enter a macro
name in the Record Macro Name box (or accept the default), and click OK.
With WinWord now recording your every action, type "Hello, world" and
select Stop Recorder from the Tools menu. Then select ToolsMacro,
highlight the macro name in the Macro Name list box, and click Edit.
WinWord's macro-editing window will appear, displaying the following
three program lines:

Sub MAIN
Insert "Hello, world"
End Sub

What happened? WinWord's macro recorder converted your keystrokes into a
WordBasic command that says, "Insert the text 'Hello, world' into the
document at the current cursor position." When you replay this macro,
WinWord will execute the WordBasic program you just created.
Alternatively, you could have created the macro directly by selecting
Tools | Macro, entering the macro name in the Macro Name box, clicking
Edit to display the macro-editing window, and typing Insert "Hello,
world". You can create simple macros using the macro recorder, but to
create complex macros (that can, for example, use conditional logic to
branch to different instructions based on the value of a variable or the
result of an input event) or macros that contain WordBasic commands for
which there are no keyboard, menu, or toolbar equivalents, you'll need
the macro editor.

The best way to get familiar with any programming language is to jump
right in and start writing programs, and WordBasic is no exception.
Limited space prohibits a full treatment of the WordBasic programming
language, but to get you started (and perhaps to get you interested in
learning more about WordBasic), the remainder of this column presents
some useful WordBasic macros designed to solve common problems with
WinWord. To enter these macros, open the macro-editing window as
described above and enter the macro text as shown. To save a macro, close
the macro-editing window by double-clicking the control-menu box in the
window's upper-left corner and answer yes when WinWord asks if you want
to keep the changes. Then when closing WinWord, answer yes when WinWord
asks if you want to save global glossary and command changes. Another way
of saving the macro is to select Save All from WinWord's File menu and
answer yes when WinWord asks you about saving your changes.

WORDBASIC AND THE AUTO MACROS

WinWord reserves a handful of macro names for special purposes. For
example, if a macro is named AutoExec, that macro is automatically
executed whenever WinWord is started. Similarly, the AutoOpen macro is
executed every time a document is opened. Other Auto macros include
AutoNew, which is executed when a new document is created; AutoClose,
which is executed when a document is closed; and AutoExit, which is
executed when WinWord terminates. Combined with a few simple WordBasic
instructions, the Auto macros present some special opportunities for you
to customize WinWord's behavior.

Here's an example. By default, WinWord positions the cursor at the
beginning of a document when an existing document file is opened. You can
return the cursor to the position it was in when the document was last
saved by pressing Shift-F5, which invokes WordBasic's GoBack command. If
you'd prefer that WinWord return the cursor to its previous position by
default, create the macro

Sub Main

GoBack

End Sub

Be sure to name the macro AutoOpen, and save it as a global macro. Then
each time you open a document, WinWord will restore the cursor to its
last position. The only problem with this macro, as Guy Gallo points out
in his excellent book Take WinWord to the Edge (1993, Ziff-Davis Press),
is that it has the odd effect of switching back to the previously active
document when you open a template, rather than a document, for editing.
You can easily solve this problem by modifying the macro to read

Sub Main
If ExistingBookmark("\PrevSel1")
Then EditGoTo "\PrevSel1"
End Sub

When a document is saved, WinWord automatically stores the cursor
position as a bookmark called \PrevSel1. AutoOpen will return to the
previous insertion point only if this bookmark exists in the current
file, a condition that does not hold true for templates.

One use for the AutoExec macro is to make sure that WinWord's main
program window pops up in a certain state. If you terminate WinWord while
it is maximized, it will automatically maximize the next time you start
it. If you terminate WinWord in a windowed (nonmaximized) state, it will
restart in a windowed state. You can ensure that WinWord will always
maximize itself on start-up by creating the following macro and naming it
AutoExec:

Sub Main
If Not AppMaximize()
Then AppMaximize
End Sub

The AppMaximize command doubles as both a statement and a function.
AppMaximize() returns a nonzero value if the WinWord window is maximized.
AppMaximize (without the parentheses) maximizes the window if it's not
maximized or restores it to nonmaximized form if it is already maximized.

The tasks that you can accomplish with WordBasic and the Auto macros are
limited only by your imagination. You could, for example, write AutoExec
and AutoExit macros that use WordBasic's Date$() and Time$() functions to
write a date and time entry to a log file each time WinWord is started or
terminated, or each time a document file is opened or closed.

Like any good programming language, WordBasic supports a full complement
of file I/O functions. You could even write an AutoExec macro that
prompts the user for a user name or a password to restrict access to
WinWord. Lest you rely too heavily on Auto macros for security, however,
be aware that starting WinWord with a /M switch bypasses AutoExec.

TRANSPOSING CHARACTERS

If you're like me, when you scan your word processing documents you
frequently find that in your haste you accidentally reversed two
characters in the middle of a word. The word transpose, for instance, may
become trasnpose. This little problem can be easily corrected by this
macro, which exchanges the character left of the cursor with the
character right of the cursor:

Sub Main
CharLeft 1,1

EditCut

CharRight

EditPaste

CharLeft

End Sub

Before running this macro, position the cursor between the two characters
that you wish to transpose. If you use this macro often, you can use the
Keyboard section of WinWord's Tools | Options menu to assign the macro to
a key combination, menu, or toolbar button. Then you can run it without
having to bring up WinWord's Macro dialog box.

SPLIT WINWORD'S WINDOW VERTICALLY

If you use the Borland C for Windows program editor (part of the Borland
C++ package for DOS and Windows), you, like me, may have grown to love
its Window | Tile command. When invoked with two source-code files open,
Window | Tile splits the document window vertically in half and fills
each half with a source-code window. This is a wonderful arrangement for
comparing two source-code files line for line. WinWord has no comparable
command, though you can split the document window horizontally with
Window | Arrange All.

With WordBasic, you can arrange document windows however you like. The
following macro tiles two documents vertically so that each fills the
entire screen from top to bottom, but only half of the screen
horizontally:

Sub Main
If CountWindows() = 2 Then
xPos = Val(AppInfo$(6)) / 2
yPos = Val(AppInfo$(7))
If DocMaximize()
Then DocMaximize
DocMove 0, 0
DocSize xPos, yPos

NextWindow

DocMove xPos, 0
DocSize xPos, yPos

NextWindow

Else

Beep

MsgBox "There must be exactly
two documents open", "Error", 48
End If
End Sub

The macro only tiles the windows if CountWindows() returns the value 2,
meaning there are exactly two documents open. The active document is
placed on the left, the inactive one on the right. If more or fewer than
two documents are open, the MsgBox statement displays an error message.
This macro calls DocMaximize to nonmaximize the active document window if
it is currently maximized, because neither DocMove nor DocSize will work
on a maximized window. AppInfo$(6) and AppInfo$(7) return the width and
height of the active document workspace, respectively.

CHANGING DEFAULT KEY ASSIGNMENTS

Through the Options dialog box invoked with the Tools | Options command,
WinWord lets you assign macros and WordBasic commands to individual keys
and key combinations. This makes it possible to change the default
actions initiated by the A to Z, 0 to 9, F2 to F12, Ins, and Del
keys--alone or in combination with the Ctrl or Ctrl and Shift keys. With
this remapping capability and a helping hand from WordBasic, you can add
some interesting twists to WinWord's keyboard interface. For example, the
following macro, when assigned to the Ins key, causes WinWord to emit a
beep whenever you press the Ins key to switch between insert and
overstrike modes (a handy feature if you hit Ins by accident and don't
realize you're in overstrike mode until you've overtyped a line of text):

Sub Main

Beep

Overtype

End Sub

WinWord's Options dialog box offers only a limited selection of keys, but
you can reprogram virtually any key on the keyboard using WordBasic's
ToolsOptionsKeyboard command. The following WordBasic macro programs the
Alt-Spacebar key combination to execute a macro named DoCalc.
(Alt-Spacebar normally displays the system menu.)

Sub Main
ToolsOptionsKeyboard .Name="DoCalc",
.KeyCode=1056, .Context=0
Print "Alt-Spacebar is now enabled"
End Sub

The value 1056 for the .KeyCode value is derived from a table in the Help
for the ToolsOptionsKeyboard command. DoCalc, in turn, is defined

Declare Function IsAppLoaded
Lib "Kernel"(Name$)\
As Integer Alias "GetModuleHandle"

Sub MAIN
If IsAppLoaded("Calc") Then
AppActivate "Calculator"

Else

Shell "CALC.EXE", 1
End If
End Sub

After the first of these macros is executed, pressing Alt-Spacebar
executes DoCalc, which brings up the Windows Calc accessory. If Calc
isn't already loaded somewhere in the system, DoCalc launches Calc with a
Shell command. If Calc is already loaded, DoCalc simply brings Calc to
the foreground by calling AppActivate and passing it Calc's window title.
Among other things, DoCalc illustrates how WordBasic programs can
directly access Windows API functions. In this case, IsAppLoaded invokes
Windows' native GetModuleHandle function, which accepts a module
(program) name and returns a module handle if a module of that name is
active in the system. A return value of 0 means the module is not loaded.

One of the most inventive uses for WordBasic key remapping that I've ever
seen is embodied in the SmartQuotes macro supplied with WinWord (in the
document file NEWMACRO.DOC). SmartQuotes is actually four macros in one.
AutoEnableSmartQuotes reprograms the keyboard to execute
AutoInsertSingleQuote when the Apostrophe key is pressed and
AutoInsertDoubleQuote when the Shift and Apostrophe keys are pressed
together. These AutoInsertQuote macros replace the standard
typewriter-style single and double quotation marks with publisher-style
curled quotation marks as you type. The fourth macro,
AutoDisableSmartQuotes, restores normal operation.

WRAPPING UP

To close, here's a favorite WordBasic macro of mine that inserts today's
date into a WinWord document:

Sub Main
InsertDateTime .DateTimePic = "MMMM d, yyyy"

CharLeft

UnlinkFields

CharRight

End Sub

Of course, inserting a date using WinWord's Insert | Date and Time
command is easy enough. But dates inserted with Insert | Date and Time
are inserted as fields, which is inappropriate if all you need is, say, a
date at the top of a business letter. This macro inserts a field
containing today's date in the format August 23, 1993, and then converts
the field into static text. Now you don't have to worry about the date at
the top of the letter changing if you decide to update other fields in
the document.

Needless to say, this discussion only scratches the surface of what you
can do with WordBasic. If you would like more information, you can order
Using WordBasic from Microsoft. You'll find instructions for ordering in
your WinWord package. As an alternative, you can call Microsoft Sales and
Service at 800-426-9400. You may also find it helpful to pick up a good
book on the subject. Two of my favorites are Take WinWord to the Edge
(1993, Ziff-Davis Press) and Woody Leonhard and Vincent Chen's Hacker's
Guide to WinWord (1993, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company).

Take some time to explore WordBasic, and you'll open up a whole new
universe of possibilities for customizing the WinWord environment.

Title:     Convert word processor files to ASCII with PCMCVT.
             (includes related articles on downloading the utilities from
             PC MagNet and on the purpose, format, and use of the PCMCVT
             command) (Utilities)
Author:    Munro, Jay
Attached:  PCMCVT.EXE  Converts word processor files to ASCII.

Abstract:  The PCMCVT utility listed lets users convert text formatted
           with popular word processors into straight ASCII. The program
           recognizes and converts the binary files created by Word for
           DOS, Word for Windows, Windows Write, WordPerfect for DOS,
           WordPerfect for Windows, and Ami Pro into ASCII files. PCMCVT
           takes up very little space and is not memory resident, which
           makes it easier to shell out to DOS and convert another
           document without having to close the current document.
           PCMCVT.COM should be put in a directory in the DOS path, which
           lets users go to any directory and start converting files
           without having to move them around. The two kinds of ASCII
           files created by the utility are 'one-line-per-paragraph,'
           which is the most common (and default) format, and a format
           that inserts hard carriage returns and line-feeds at the end
           of each screen line. In the default format, everything up to a
           hard carriage return is considered part of a single line,
           regardless of the number of lines it occupies on the screen.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What do you do when you receive a document prepared on a word processing
program you don't happen to have? Dozens of formatting codes for every
font change, margin, and mode are embedded in the manuscript, and every
one of them is worse than useless if you have to do any work on the text.

This issue's free utility eliminates this hassle. If you ever need to
turn text formatted with today's most popular word processors into
straight ASCII, all you need is PCMCVT. PCMCVT recognizes and converts
the binary files produced by Word for DOS, Word for Windows, Windows
Write, WordPerfect for DOS, WordPerfect for Windows, and Ami Pro into
ASCII files.

Keeping all these different word processors on your machine would be
prohibitive both in cost and disk space. Moreover, you'd have to learn
enough of each of their commands to open the files you receive and then
resave them in ASCII format. And you'd have to know which program to use
on the document you received. PCMCVT does all this for you automatically,
making it the perfect answer to word processor overload.

PCMCVT is not a memory-resident program, and it takes up very little
space when it runs. This can be very handy when you want to shell out to
DOS and convert an additional document without having to close the
document on which you're working. Most word processors today provide a
shell-to-DOS capability, and since PCMCVT weighs in at under 10K, it runs
very comfortably in a DOS shell. Some word processors, such as Microsoft
Word for DOS, can accept a DOS command without even requiring you to
shell out to DOS, making it possible to convert a file with PCMCVT
without even seeing a DOS prompt.

The easiest way to get a copy of PCMCVT.COM and its assembly language
source code is to download the file PCMCVT.ZIP from PC MagNet. Details
are provided in the "PC MagNet: Utilities and More" sidebar. If you make
any changes in the PCMCVT source code, you'll need MASM 6.0 or later to
reassemble the program.

If you don't have a modem, we'll supply the PCMCVT files on-disk without

USING PCMCVT

You should put PCMCVT.COM in a directory on your DOS path. That way you
can then go to any directory and start converting files without having to
move them around. You enter PCMCVT with one or more parameters, from the
DOS prompt. Its complete syntax is

PCMCVT /S source [/D destination]
[/Wxx] [/O] [Tx] [/?]

The only required PCMCVT parameter is /S source, the filename of the
word-processed document you want to convert into ASCII text. Spaces can
be included between the /S and the filename but are not required. The
source filename must be complete, with no wildcards or missing
extensions; the Quick Reference Guide explains how to process a batch of
files.

When creating a file for the converted text, PCMCVT uses the same
filename as that of the source file by default, adding only the extension
.TXT. Thus, if you enter PCMCVT /S MYLETTER.DOC the source file will
remain unchanged and the converted file will be called MYLETTER.TXT. By
adding the optional /D destination parameter on the command line, you can
specify any legal DOS filename (including a path, if desired) for the
converted file.

If a same-named file exists in the destination directory, PCMCVT will
warn you and give you the choice to overwrite the file or not. If you
answer No, the easiest way to reenter the command up to the point of
typing in a new destination file name is to hit F3. If you want PCMCVT to
overwrite same-named files automatically and without a warning prompt,
simply include the /O switch parameter on the command line. This can be
useful when you are running PCMCVT from a batch file.

To tell PCMCVT to word-wrap lines at a certain length, you use the /Wxx
parameter, where xx is the maximum number of characters desired. With a
setting of /W60, PCMCVT will force a new line by inserting a carriage
return/line-feed (CRLF) after a maximum of 60 characters. When converting
a line longer than xx characters, PCMCVT tries to find a convenient space
to break the line. Thus in this example, although the specified length is
60, the line may break at 45, 52, or 59 characters, depending on where
the last word space occurred. If a file contains a long, unbroken
character string, PCMCVT has no choice but to break the line at the
specified length.

If you enter the /W switch parameter without specifying a value for xx,
PCMCVT defaults to a line length of 78 characters and replaces soft
carriage returns in the original document with hard carriage returns.

By default, PCMCVT passes on the tab character (ASCII 9) to the
destination file. This is not always desirable. The /Tx switch replaces
tab characters with the number of spaces you specify as x. Thus, for
example, /T5 replaces all tab characters with 5 spaces, which you might
use to approximate the tab spacing in the original document. If no value
of x is specified, the tab is removed.

If you forget the syntax details, you can get a listing of the PCMCVT
options by entering the command with no parameter or with the /? switch.

CONVERTING FILES

PCMCVT can create two kinds of ASCII files. The most common (and the
default) format is called "one-line-per-paragraph." In this format,
everything up to a hard carriage return is considered part of a single
line, no matter how many lines it may occupy on the screen. The other
format inserts hard carriage returns and line-feeds at the end of each
screen line, whose length is specified by the word-wrap setting as
explained above.

Which format is more appropriate in a given situation depends on how the
file will eventually be used. If you wish to import the converted text
into a word processor, the one-line-per-paragraph format makes the most
sense, as it leaves the word processor free to impose its own margin
settings and reformatting on the text.

Fixed-length lines delimited by a carriage return/line-feed, on the other
hand, are perfect for text files that are to be typed or browsed from a
DOS prompt. README files are a good example. With the trend in shareware
toward using the Windows Write format for instructions, you could preview
a newly downloaded file without having to fire up Windows.

FILE FORMATS

In addition to the text that you want and the formatting codes that you
don't, word-processed files contain information that uniquely identifies
the word processor that created them. For this reason, during the
conversion process PCMCVT is able to display the name of the originating
word processing system. Identifying the native document format also
enables PCMCVT to use the appropriate routines to extract the text from
the file.

Among the document formats PCMCVT supports--the DOS or Windows versions
of WordPerfect 5.1 or later; Word for DOS, Version 5.0 or later; Word for
Windows (WinWord), Version 1.0 or later; Windows Write 3.x; and Ami
Pro--the three from Microsoft are very similar, so I'll discuss them
first.

WORD/WINWORD/WINDOWS WRITE

Since its introduction in 1983, the file format for Microsoft Word has
remained unchanged. Microsoft had the foresight at that time to define
structures larger than were immediately needed so that new features could
be added without changing the basic format. As shown in Figure 1, a Word
document file consists of three sections: the header, or file information
block; the text section; and the formatting section. This basic file
structure is shared by the three Microsoft file formats with but slight
differences, which I'll discuss as they arise.

PCMCVT is concerned only with the first two sections of the Microsoft
document format, that is, the FIB or file information block, and the text
section. In identifying which word processor was used to create the
original file, however, PCMCVT also makes use of a second identifying
characteristic, called the signature. A file signature is usually a
unique byte sequence at a specific position in the file that sets it
apart from other files. In the Microsoft document files, for example, the
signature is contained in the first 2 bytes, as shown below:

File format        Signature
Word 5.5           31BEh
WinWord 1.x        9BA5h
WinWord 2.0        DBA5h
Windows Write 3.1  31BEh

From the signatures alone we can tell WinWord and Word for DOS apart, but
Windows Write presents a problem, as it shares the same signature with
Word for DOS. This is where the reserved areas of the FIB come into play.
Starting from the beginning of the file, if we look at the value of the
2-byte word located at offset 96, we'll get our answer. If the value is
0, then the file is written in Word for DOS; if it has any other value,
it's Windows Write. With the type of file nailed down, we can move on to
figuring out the size of the text portion.

As Figure 1 indicates, the text follows the file information block. In
both Word for DOS and Windows Write the text starts 128 bytes from the
beginning of the file. The starting offset of the text in WinWord is
specified by a word stored at offset 24 from the start of the file. Now
that we know the file type and the start of the text, with one more piece
of information and a bit of math, we can move on to read the text.

The actual length of the text plus the header size is stored as a DWord
(double word) at offset 28 from the start of the file. By subtracting the
header size (128 for Word and Write, 384 for WinWord), we get the length
of the text to be converted.

Of the formats handled by PCMCVT, Microsoft's are the easiest to convert.
Once the header information is gathered and the text length is
determined, what is left to be read is essentially pure ASCII text.
Unlike the other formats, only a few characters in the text demand
special treatment during conversion.

In Windows Write, Word for DOS, and WinWord, the pair of ASCII character
codes 13 and 10 (carriage return and line-feed) are used for paragraph
ends; character code 12 is used for explicit page breaks; and character
code 9 is used for tab characters. PCMCVT keeps all these characters
unchanged in the converted text unless, of course, the /Tx switch is
specified to expand tabs into spaces.

Several other special codes are used in Word for DOS and WinWord. Hard
line breaks are stored as character 11, which PCMCVT replaces with a
carriage return/line-feed pair. PCMCVT replaces ASCII 15, the character
that Word uses for the em-hyphen, or em-dash, with two normal hyphens.
Word for DOS defines the 196 as a nonbreaking hyphen and 255 as a
nonbreaking space; WinWord uses ASCII 30 for a nonbreaking hyphen and
ASCII 160 for a nonbreaking space. So in these files, depending on the
original format of the file--WinWord or Word--PCMCVT replaces the 30 or
196 with a character 45 (hyphen), and 160 or 255 with a 32 (space). The
utility ignores all other characters with a value of ASCII 31 or less.

WORDPERFECT

WordPerfect file formats are essentially the same in Versions 5.1 for DOS
and in 5.1 and 5.2 for Windows. The format goes back only to WordPerfect
5.0, which represented a considerable departure from that of the earlier
4.2 version.

WordPerfect 5.x files contain a 16-byte file header, called the prefix
area, that identifies the file and provides certain basic file
information. The first 4 bytes consist of the hexadecimal value 0FFh and
the three letters WPC, which comprise the signature. Although PCMCVT uses
only the signature and the next 4 bytes (which point to the start of the
text), the prefix area also contains information about the type of
document, the version of WordPerfect that created the file, and so forth.

After the header, WordPerfect document files are not segmented in the
manner of Microsoft files. Except for some initial formatting information
stored in an additional prefix area immediately after the 16-byte header,
all formatting information is embedded in the document area itself.
Having the formatting codes and data in the text area makes the
conversion process somewhat more difficult.

WordPerfect uses both single and multibyte codes to identify functions.
Single-byte codes employ some of the same control characters (ASCII
values of less than 32) used in Word files. In WordPerfect, such control
characters are used to signal carriage returns, page feeds, page numbers,
and special merge codes. Single-byte codes in the hexadecimal range from
80h to 0BFh (128 to 191 decimal) are used to turn such functions as
justification, columns, and footnotes on and off. PCMCVT traps the
single-byte codes for hard hyphens and hard spaces. Hard hyphens occur in
three types (in-line hyphens, end-of-line hyphens, and end-of-page
hyphens) and use codes 0A9h, 0AAh, abd 0ABh. Hard spaces use the code
0A0h. PCMCVT looks for these codes and replaces them with the standard
hyphen (ASCII 45) and space (ASCII 32) characters. Except for hard
hyphens, hard spaces, carriage returns, and page feeds, PCMCVT strips out
all the rest of the single-byte code characters when it converts a file.

Multibyte functions are where the real fun starts. There are over 50
pages of documentation on the multibyte functions in the WordPerfect
developers guide! These functions are of two kinds. Fixed-length
functions use the range from hexadecimal 0C0h to 0CFh (192 to 207
decimal), and variable-length functions lie in the range of hexadecimal
0D0h to 0FFh (208 to 255 decimal).

The fixed-length functions begin with a code (for example, 0C1h for
tab-align), which is followed by a series of bytes of data. The end of
the function is signaled by a repetition of the initial code. PCMCVT
recognizes only one of these functions, 0C1h, the tab-align code. While
most word processors use the tab character (ASCII 9), WordPerfect signals
a tab with the tab-align function. The function contains a byte that
distinguishes between standard tabs and left, right, or center alignment,
depending on which bits are set. PCMCVT retrieves the byte and, if the
code is for tab, replaces the functions with either an ASCII 9 character,
or the number of spaces if the /T parameter was used. In all other
functions, PCMCVT ignores everything between the two appearances of
WordPerfect's multibyte fixed-length codes.

Variable-length multibyte functions have a slightly different format. The
actual size of the function is stored in the codes. These functions start
with a 1-byte begin function code followed by a 1-byte sub function code.
This combination ensures over 12,000 possible variations, giving
WordPerfect a lot of room for expansion.

Immediately following the sub function code is a word (2 bytes) that
contains the length of the function. The value represents the size of the
whole function, including the beginning and the ending codes. After the
length word comes the data for the function. Multibyte functions can
cover a wide range of different features, such as margin commands, font
changes, printer codes, and graphics information.

At the end of the code sequence, the first section repeats itself, only
in reverse order. That is to say, the size word of the function is
duplicated, followed by the sub function code, and finally the function
code. In its conversions, PCMCVT must ignore (that is, strip out) all the
multibyte functions. Instead of examining each byte in search of the
ending code, however, PCMCVT figures out the length from the size word
and jumps past the function, saving the time it might take to scan
through possibly hundreds of bytes.

AMI PRO

Compared with the Microsoft and WordPerfect products, Ami Pro presents an
unusual format: Its files consist almost completely of ASCII text. Like
its competitors, Ami Pro does have a header to store information,
followed by the document area. Like WordPerfect, Ami Pro also embeds
formatting commands in the text area. However, the difference is that the
formatting codes are set off by certain low ASCII characters such as <
and @, rather than high-bit ASCII characters.

The Ami Pro signature used by PCMCVT is the text string [ver] at the very
start of the file. Following the signature comes line after line of
information about the file--printer last used, font information, title of
file, and so forth. PCMCVT skips through all this information and
searches straightaway for the Ami Pro start-of-document text string,
[edoc].

The text that follows the [edoc] string stores formatting information
both at the beginning and in the middle of the text lines. Simple
formatting information, such as bold on and off, is signaled with <>
signs surrounding a code. For example, if the single word bold were
supposed to appear in boldface, the code below would be used:

The next word is <+!>bold<-!>

Such formatting is humanly readable. The code for boldface is the
exclamation point. It is turned on with a plus sign and turned off with a
minus sign.

To distinguish between formatting codes and characters that are part of
the user's text, Ami Pro usually places a less-than sign (<) before the
character. For example, if the text contains a less-than sign, Ami Pro
prefixes it with another less-than sign. So if Ami Pro (or PCMCVT, for
that matter) sees two less-than signs (<<) in a row, it ignores one and
prints the other as a regular character. To signify a greater-than sign,
Ami Pro uses the three characters less-than, semicolon, and greater-than
(< ; >).

Ami Pro uses a similar coding format for many features, even page breaks.
Although in most word processors hard page breaks are usually an ASCII
character 12, Ami Pro puts the code <:P> at the beginning of the first
line of a new page instead. About the only ASCII control codes that Ami
Pro uses are the carriage return/line-feeds and tab characters (ASCII 9).
And again, as with all but the tab, carriage return/line-feed, and page
feeds, PCMCVT reads the Ami Pro codes and skips over them, extracting
only the actual text of the file.

HOW PCMCVT WORKS

PCMCVT was written in assembly language, using Microsoft Macro Assembler
6.0. (Version 6.1 would work as well.) A modular programming approach was
implemented for each conversion routine, so each conversion algorithm
could be designed and tested independently. What follows is a broad
overview of how PCMCVT works; add the complete commented assembly code
(available on PC MagNet) and you'll have everything you need to
understand the PCMCVT utility.

The main module of the program contains the routines for file handling,
identifying headers, parsing the command line, word wrapping, and other
support functions.

Program execution starts by revectoring INT 24h. This allows PCMCVT to
handle critical errors itself rather than by means of the classic "Abort,
Retry, Ignore" message. The HookInt24h and UnHookInt24h functions simply
intercept critical errors and send program execution back to the calling
program. Because the carry flag is set on the return, PCMCVT sees the
error and can process it as needed.

As a command line program, PCMCVT needs to read and parse the parameters
the user passes to it. It thus reads offset 80h of the Program Segment
Prefix (PSP), which contains the number of command line parameters. If
none are found, PCMCVT simply displays a help screen and terminates. If
it finds any user-supplied parameters, it calls the ParseCommandLine
function. In order to simplify the parsing process, PCMCVT first
capitalizes the incoming command line string. The parsing function steps
through each parameter, extracts the filenames and switches, and then
stores them for later use.

The next step is to identify the source file's word processing format by
examining the header and signature. PCMCVT opens the source file and
reads a 256-byte chunk of the file into the HeaderBuffer. This is more
than sufficient to identify the five formats supported here, and it
leaves room for expansion later. The function HeadCheck steps through the
beginning of the HeaderBuffer, looking first for a WordPerfect signature,
then for the signature of Word for DOS, WinWord, and finally AMI Pro. The
function StrCmp is called with pointers to the HeaderBuffer looking for
matches. If no matching signatures are found, PCMCVT displays the message
"Sorry, unknown format" and exits.

The HeadCheck function returns a value that corresponds to the file type
found. This determines which conversion routine will be called. If the
value is a valid format that PCMCVT can handle, the destination file is
opened and execution moves on to the appropriate conversion routine. The
code shown in Figure 2 is the signature-checking routine that HeadCheck
uses for WordPerfect. The routine is duplicated in PCMCVT, using the
unique signature for each file type.

CALLING CONVERSION ROUTINES

The PCMCVT conversion routines are essentially integral units that call
external routines for file support and that use global data. The way text
is extracted from its native file varies with the specific word
processor. However, the conversion routines use similar steps, starting
with finding the beginning of the text in the file.

Each module begins by getting (or calculating) the start of the text
section, to which the file pointer is then reset. (The file pointer needs
to be reset because it was left 256 bytes from the start by the
header-reading procedure.) Once the pointer is reset, the first block of
text is read into a 2,024-byte (2K) input buffer. This buffer size was
chosen as a compromise between the demands of adequate workspace and the
danger of hogging too much memory. If the file is less than 2K, the
buffer size is adjusted accordingly. If nothing is left to read from the
file, the routine will exit with an error. The file read routine is
self-contained, handling errors and monitoring the amount of text input
by itself.

The actual conversion process consists of a byte-by-byte comparison
between the source file characters and the codes and special characters
that PCMCVT recognizes. PCMCVT performs a trio of tests--Use it, Replace
it, Ignore it--on each successive character (or series of characters, in
the case of a multibyte function). For each file format, the decision may
be different. In Microsoft Word, for example, the carriage
return/line-feed (CRLF) characters are passed on to the destination
(output) file. However, in Ami Pro, because each line is CRLF delimited,
PCMCVT needs to check whether there is one or more than one CRLF. If
there is only one, it is ignored. If there is more than one CRLF, the
first is ignored but each additional one is passed on the output.

All the conversion modules handle tabs in the same manner. When a tab
character (ASCII 9) is found, the DoTabs routine is called. DoTabs, a
simple routine as shown in Figure 3, determines whether PCMCVT is to pass
the tab character on or replace it with spaces. If the /Txx switch is in
effect, DoTabs writes the correct number of spaces to the output file.
Otherwise it simply writes out a tab character.

To write data, whether characters or control codes, PCMCVT calls the
WriteIt function. WriteIt is also self-contained. WriteIt accepts a
character in AL and puts it into the output buffer. The output buffer,
also 2,024 bytes (2K) long, is used exclusively by WriteIt. WriteIt
monitors the current character position and, when the buffer is full,
writes the buffer's contents to the destination file. WriteIt can be
forced to write (or flush) its buffer by calling it with a -1 in AL. The
buffer is flushed when PCMCVT gets to the end of the source file.

PCMCVT reads the source file in sections. When the conversion routine
comes to the end of the input buffer, a call is made to read in another
piece of the file. The file-reading routine preserves all registers and
updates the input buffer pointer after the file is read. The input buffer
points at the current character the conversion routine is to consider.
Thus, when the file-reading routine returns to the conversion module,
execution can pick up exactly where it left off, except that now the
input buffer has a new block of text to convert. This is important in
cases like that of the WordPerfect conversion module, where the input
buffer can run out of characters while in the middle of a
multibyte-function-scanning loop.

If the /Wxx option was specified, the self-contained word-wrap module is
called when WriteIt writes the buffer to disk. Working with the output
buffer, the word-wrap routines scan the text in a two-step process. After
saving the current pointer into the output buffer, the first scan looks
for carriage return/line-feeds, which signal the end of a string of
characters. While scanning, the word-wrap routine counts the characters
at which it looks. When it finds a CRLF, or if it comes to the end of the
buffer, the number of characters is compared with the value specified on
the command line. If a CRLF was found in fewer characters than the
specified value, the line is printed as is and the scanning starts over
again. But if the CRLF is found beyond the desired line length (/Wxx
value), the second scan is performed.

The second scan, in Figure 4, actually consists of a series of small
scans. The current string or line is scanned for a space (ASCII 32) or a
tab (ASCII 9), which signals a break between two words. Each time a space
is found, its position in relation to the start of the current string is
compared with the specified line length value. If the space's position is
less than the line length, the position value is saved and the string is
further scanned. This continues until either a space is found with its
position greater than the requested length of the line, or the end of the
buffer is encountered.

Several things happen when the scanning process finds a space in the
string at a position greater than the line length value. First, the value
of the starting position of the current scan is retrieved. The starting
value and the last space position are subtracted, yielding the number of
characters in the string. This number of characters is used for the
length of the line when the string is written to the output file.

Once the string of characters is written, the program writes a CRLF
combination (ASCII 13 and 10) to the destination file, completing the
line. When the CRLF writing is done, the program clears the current
character counter and stores the last space's position in the starting
position variable, and then the scanning process starts all over again.

A slight variation on the previous procedure is required when the routine
runs out of characters at the end of the output buffer before either a
CRLF or the specified line length is reached. In this case, the current
line is written to the destination file without a CRLF. The length is
stored and the word-wrap procedure returns to the main program. Since the
files are read and written in small sections, the next time the word-wrap
function is called, it picks up where it left off and maintains the
correct line length throughout the conversion.

When PCMCVT finishes converting the file, it closes all files and returns
to the command prompt. The utility also returns error level codes for use
in batch files. If the conversion was successful, the return code is a 0.
The other error level exit codes are shown below:

Error- level code       Meaning
1                       Source file not found
2                       Destination existed, not overwritten
3                       Drive not ready
4                       Disk full

CAVEATS

PCMCVT is designed for quick-and-dirty text conversion. Given the
complexity of today's word processors, you may occasionally run into a
file that either will not convert, or will convert very oddly. One format
that does not convert well with PCMCVT, for example, is WinWord's
so-called fast save format. This format keeps text in the original text
area, but it also incrementally saves text in the area after the
formatting area. While you're unlikely to receive a Winword document you
need to convert that has not been saved in the regular manner, if you hit
one saved in the fast save format you'll have to consult WinWord help.

Other casualties of stripping out formatting codes are headers and
footers. The loss of formatting on outlines or tables could render the
text unreadable. Fortunately, PCMCVT will prove entirely adequate for the
vast majority of your conversion needs.

PCMCVT Command

Jay Munro                           June 29, 1993 (Utilities)

Purpose:To strip formatting codes from word processing documents created
by Word for DOS, Word for Windows, Windows Write, Word Perfect for DOS,
WordPerfect for Windows, and Ami Pro, creating a pure ASCII text file.
PCMCVT can save the converted files either in one-line-per-paragraph or
in user-specifiable line lengths delimited with a carriage
return/line-feed. Tab characters may be retained or converted to a
user-specifiable number of spaces.

Format:PCMCVT /S source [/D destination] [/Wxx]
[/O] [Tx] [/?]

Remarks:Entered at the DOS prompt with the name of the file to be
converted as its /S source required parameter, PCMCVT by default produces
an ASCII text with the filename of source.TXT. A different destination
filename can be specified with the /D destination parameter, and both /S
and /D switches accept paths as well as filenames. The source filename
must be complete and may not use wildcards. To convert a batch of files
that share, for example, a *.DOC extension, the following batch file
command line can be executed:

FOR %a in (*.DOC) DO PCMCVT /s %a

The /Wxx parameter allows specifying a maximum line length of xx
characters, each line terminated with a carriage return/line-feed. Line
breaks are made on word spaces short of the xx value, when possible. By
default, tab characters (ASCII 9) are retained in the destination file
unless the /Txx is included as part of the PCMCVT command line. In that
case, tab characters are replaced by x spaces. PCMCVT warns before
overwriting same-named files unless the automatic overwrite switch, /O,
is used. Syntax help can be obtained by entering the command without
parameters or with the /? switch.

PCMCVT.COM and its assembly source files can be downloaded together as
PCMCVT.ZIP from PC MagNet.

Title:     Quick tips.
Author:    Rohan, Rebecca


Abstract:  Tips for using several popular microcomputer applications,
           including Microsoft Word for Windows and OnTime for Windows,
           are presented. OnTime users can print out all messages in the
           system but can only view messages for a single day on the
           screen; those who have a print-to-disk driver installed can
           display reports on-screen. Changing the default .DOC extension
           in Microsoft Word for Windows 2.0 involves adding a single
           line to the WIN.INI file. One way to calculate columns in Word
           for Windows without using tables is to select a column with
           the Ctrl-Shift-F8 key combination and choose Calculate from
           the Tools menu; the result of the calculation will appear on
           the status bar. The bombing of the World Trade Center should
           make users more aware of the need for off-site backups for
           disaster recovery.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full Text:

Tip 1: See OnTime Reports Onscreen

If you have a program like OnTime for Windows that relies heavily on
printer output, you might want to get more information from the screen
before firing up your printer. With OnTime, you can print out all
messages in the system, but are only able to view messages for a single
day on the screen. This omission can be particularly annoying for those
who have no printer. If you have a program like ZSoft's Publisher's
Paintbrush with a driver for printing to TIFF files on-disk, you can now
view all your messages without a printer.

Make sure the print-to-disk driver is installed in Windows. If it is,
you'll see it when you enter Printer Setup from a program's File menu, or
from the Printers icon in Windows' Control Panel. When you want to see
all messages in OnTime, use Printer Setup to switch to the Print-to-TIFF
driver, then choose "Print all messages in system" from the File menu's
Print selection. When the output is written to disk, open Publisher's
Paintbrush and view your appointments as a TIFF file.

TIP 2: Change the Default DOC Extension in WinWord 2.0

If WinWord's DOC extensions are too generic, add this line your WIN.INI
under the section with the bracketed [Microsoft Word 2.0] heading:
DOC-extension=.bob (or the extension you use most often).

Now, when you use the Open command from the File menu, WinWord will offer
a list of files with your chosen extension. The default extension for
saved files will also change.

By changing the document extension once a month to J93 (for January
1993), F93, M93, etc., you'll see only a list of files created during the
current month when you use the Open command from the File menu. Use the
extensions JAN, FEB, MAR, etc. to get a list of all the January files
from every year you use the new extension conventions. If your work is
cyclical, it may pay to go to File Manager and sort old files by date,
renaming them to fit a new monthly or quarterly model.

TIP 3: Green Pictures in WinWord?

If you use the Insert menu to import a large BMP (bitmap) file to
WinWord, the picture may look green in places. To correct that, try using
the Paste command from the Edit menu. With Paste, the same picture should
appear perfectly normal.

Tip 4: Calculate Without Tables in WinWord 2.0

You don't have to insert a table or even separate columns with tabs to
select columns of numbers in WinWord 2.0 as long as you use the keyboard
instead of the mouse. First, make sure the status bar is displayed by
choosing Options from the Tool menu. Click the View icon and see that
Status Bar is checked.

To select a column, place the cursor at one corner of the column of
numbers you want to calculate. Press Control, Shift, and F8. "COL"
appears on the status bar. Use arrow keys to select the rest of the
column, then choose Calculate from the Tools menu. The result of the
calculation appears on the status bar.

Tip 5: Keeping and Flushing Clips

After copying and pasting large graphics or blocks of text, save the file
that received the pasted object, and then bring up the Windows Clipboard.
To flush the contents of the Clipboard, choose Edit, and then Delete.

When Delete is selected, a dialog box will ask if you want to clear the
contents of the clipboard. You may also save clips for future use with a
CLP extension.

Tip 6: Lesson From the Trade Center

After the catastrophe at the World Trade Center, it should be clear that
it isn't enough to make backups of files. If your business depends on the
data you keep, it's important to have a second set of backups stored
off-site.

Professional off-site storage services abound, but small businesses with
information that isn't highly confidential might get by with storing a
set of backups at home in case of fire or flood.

To guard against widespread perils such as earthquakes, consider
exchanging data with an out-of-town branch. Single-site business owners
from opposite sides of town might cooperatively store backups for each
other. Two business owners could install dedicated backup hard drives on
each other's machines, then dial into their off-site vaults to perform a
second backup at the close of the business day.

Choose a backup partner from contacts made at trade associations or civic
groups. Use DES file encryption to keep files confidential. Be
far-sighted with disaster-planning--and creative with low-hassle
solutions. If you'd rather not tie up phone lines, choose a partner whose
office is across town from yours, but on the way home from work, then
drop off backups after you leave your office.

If you back up to a tape drive, have an identical drive with identical
tape-drive software installed on your backup buddy's machine so you can
get to your files if disaster strikes. Meet with your new partner to
discuss hardware and software purchases. The more identical hardware and
software you buy, the easier it would be to work in your partner's
environment if your office is unavailable. Discuss ways you could share
space and equipment in a worst-case scenario. Can you take over your
partner's office at night?

Think through all aspects of your business that can't be saved by renting
new office space and equipment. If you depend on paper files, now is the
time to scan and store that data off-site. Make it office policy to store
every address and phone number on both electronic and paper media. That
way, current records can be easily backed up across town over the phone
lines, and you'll have access to the paper records in case of a power
failure.

Tip 7: Cheap Reminder

If you open Windows with a command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, and close
Windows at the end of your workday, it's easy to give yourself a free
reminder to back up files, pick up the kids, take backups home, and so
on. Add this line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, right after the line that
reads "WIN": @ECHO Take floppies home!

The reminder will only appear the first time you quit Windows after each
boot of the machine.

Take it from the experts: There is an easier way. Streamline your work
with these 67 timesavers for 16 best-selling DOS and Windows
applications.

Software is supposed to make our lives easier. But today's mainstream
applications give you so many ways to accomplish the same thing, you may
end up taking the long road home when the shortcut is just a keystroke or
mouse click away.

To identify the shortcuts, we asked 16 software gurus, book authors,
support technicians, consultants, and PC World contributing editors to
let us in on their secrets for the quickest, most efficient ways to
operate inside their favorite applications. You'll find hot tips for
using best- selling word processors (Ami Pro 3.0, WordPerfect 5.1,
WordPerfect 5.1 for Windows, Microsoft Word 5.0 and 5.5, and Word for
Windows 2.0); spreadsheet programs (1-2-3 for DOS and Windows, Quattro
Pro for DOS, and Excel 4.0); databases (dBASE IV and Paradox); draw,
presentation, and desktop publishing packages (CorelDraw 3.0, Harvard
Graphics 3.0, and PageMaker 4.0); and even the enormously popular
accounting program Quicken 6.0. Whether you use just one or several of
these packages, you'll find tips that will make you so much more
productive, you may be able to leave work an hour early.

Working Smart in Ami Pro 3.0

Working in Style

In the old days of DOS word processors, I did a lot of manual formatting.
Now I create specialized templates for common documents, so when I need a
bulleted list or an indented paragraph, I just press a function key or
pick a style from a list. Here's how you can set up customized style
sheets.

Start Ami Pro, which loads the -DEFAULT.STY sheet and selects
Style-Modify Style. From the Style list, choose Body Text for the bulk of
your text. Specify the font, size, alignment, and other options in the
dialog box, then select Save. Modify the other existing styles in the
same way. To create a new style name, such as Indented Text, choose Body
Text, select Save As, type the new name, then select OK. Select the
Alignment option and set your indents, then make any other changes you
need and select Save again. Create or alter any other styles you need,
then select OK. To alter page layout options for the default template,
select Page- Modify Page Layout and set up margins, columns, tabs, and so
on.

To make your changes permanent, select Style-Save as a Style Sheet. In
the dialog box, type -DEFAULT.STY in the File Name text box if it's not
already there. Enter a description in the Description text box, then
select OK and confirm overwriting the file. For other types of documents,
follow the same steps, but enter a different file name when you save the
style sheet.

Stylish Templates

Style sheets aren't limited to formatting; they can also contain
boilerplate text, frames, and graphical images. I've created a
letterhead, with my company logo, as part of a LETTER.STY style sheet.
Type in a signature block and add an automatically updated date by
selecting Edit-Insert-Date- Time. Just add the standard elements before
saving your document as a style sheet. Then, in the Save as a Style Sheet
dialog box, check the With Contents box before selecting OK.

Paragraph Pranks

To attach a template to a new document, select File-New, choose that
template from the list, and select OK. You'll save time if you type your
text in the default Body Text style. To reformat, position the cursor in
the paragraph, then click the Style button on the left side of the status
bar at the bottom of the screen to display a list. It's even faster to
press the function key shown to the left of each style in the list. To
change the function keys, select Style-Style Management and make your
changes in the dialog box.

For even faster paragraph formatting, assign a style to one block of
text, then select that block and press <Ctrl>-T or select Text-Fast
Format. Choose Only Paragraph Style and select OK. Your mouse pointer
will change to a paintbrush. To apply the same style to other paragraphs,
click and drag on any part of a paragraph. When you're finished with that
particular style, press <Ctrl>-T or select Text-Fast Format again to turn
fast formatting off.

-George Campbell

Working Smart in Word 5.0

Quick Keystrokes

I'm neither a menu person nor a mouser. Fortunately, Word 5.0 supports my
style with some handy keystrokes, such as <Ctrl>-<Page Up> to get to the
first line of a document, and <Ctrl>-<Page Down> to reach the end.

To select a paragraph, place the cursor anywhere in the paragraph and
press <F10>. To format continuous text, press <F6> at the start of the
text, then press <F10> for as many paragraphs as you want to format, or
use the <Down> and <Right> cursor keys to move quickly through the
document. To apply a format to an entire document, press <Shift>-<F10> to
select all the text, then <Alt>-XB for bold, <Alt>-XU for underline, or
<Alt>-XI for italics.

To undo character formatting, highlight the text, then press <Alt>-X
<Space>. If the paragraph formatting is wrong but you can't figure out
why, select the offending paragraphs, then press <Alt>-XP to strip out
the character or paragraph formatting.

Default Zone

If you hate having your margins set at Word's default 1.25 inches every
time you start a document, don't agonize- customize! Create a style sheet
by pressing <Esc>GI. Then <Tab> to Usage and press D<Tab><F1><Enter>. Now
press FM. Reset the margins to your preferred default and press <Enter>.
Press TS and save the style sheet as the default NORMAL.STY, then press
<Enter>, and E to return to your document.

Zig-Zag Zap

Don't waste time printing documents to see how lines will break. Instead,
press <Esc>O, then tab over to Show Line Breaks and set it to Yes. This
setting will show you where a line of monospace characters will break. If
you see that your text is running off the side of the screen, but you're
not trying to align text, set Show Line Breaks to No.

Working Smart in Word 5.5

Cure for Function Key Homesickness

Because Word 5.5's drop-down menu interface is so handy, I don't have to
remember so many different commands. I do have to remember, though, that
the old <Alt>-key formatting commands from Word 5.0 use the <Ctrl> key
instead. So instead of pressing <Alt>-B for boldface, I have to press
<Ctrl>-B.

Sometimes I get homesick for Word 5.0's function key shortcuts. When this
happens, I select Utilities-Customize, check the Use Word 5.0 Function
Keys box, and select OK.

See It All

To see as much text as possible on the screen, select View- Preferences,
then choose Text, 50 Lines, 80 Columns, 16 Colors in the Display Mode
list box. The Text mode speeds up the program; to see italics and
boldfacing press <Alt>-<F9>.

The Glossary Gift

Whenever I need to store text for use in other documents, I automate the
process with Word's Glossary feature. Here's how: Type the text, then
highlight it and select Edit- Glossary. In the dialog box, type an
easy-to-remember abbreviation (like ADD for an address) in the Glossary
Name field, then select Define. When you exit the program, click Yes to
save glossary changes. When you need the text in another document, type
the abbreviation, then press <F3> to insert it at the cursor position.

If you forget the abbreviations, select Edit-Glossary, find the
abbreviation in the list, and select Insert to pop it in.

Cunning Keyboard Tricks

Sometimes there's such a thing as too much freedom of choice. Take
selecting text in WinWord: You can use the mouse, the keyboard, or the
mouse and the keyboard. So what's the fastest, smartest way? Treat the
mouse like the disease-bearing vermin it is and memorize the following
shortcuts.

To select a single word and the space after it, place your cursor on it
and press <F8> twice. To select a sentence and the space after it, press
it three times. Pressing <F8> and a character highlights to the next
occurrence of that character. Four presses gives you the paragraph, and
five selects the whole document. (If you want to get technical, though,
<Ctrl>-<Numpad 5> is an even faster way to select everything.)

Selected more than you wanted? <Shift>-<F8> backs you down one level. If
you change your mind entirely, press <Esc> to turn off WinWord's
selection mode.

Take Control of Your Formats

When you need to format text, take Control. <Ctrl>-B makes selected text
boldface; <Ctrl>-I, italic; <Ctrl>-U, underlined. You can use these
toggles to format selected text or to set the format for the next
character as you type. Press the same key combo to toggle them off.

<Ctrl>-A toggles text entered in lowercase between uppercase or
lowercase, but remember, it's only an appearance; Edit- Find and
Edit-Replace won't see those characters as uppercase, and if you save the
file as text only, you'll lose the appearance formatting. To actually
change the case of selected text, use <Shift>-<F3>, which cycles selected
text through lowercase, uppercase, and initial capitals.

To format paragraphs, press <Ctrl>-1 or <Ctrl>-2 for single and double
spacing, respectively, and <Ctrl>-E, <Ctrl>-L, and <Ctrl>-R for centered,
left-, and right-aligned text. To clear all formatting, press <Ctrl>-
<Space>.

Quick Text Inserts

Only a dolt types the same text more than once. When you need to insert
the same text over and over in your document, save it as a glossary
entry. Select the text, press <Alt>EO to call up the Glossary dialog box,
type a name for the entry (use something memorable), and press <Enter>.
Then, whenever you need to insert the text, type the glossary name and
press <F3>.

The Mouse House

If you must mouse, here are a few pointers. Double-click on a word to
select it. To select a line, place the cursor in the left margin so it
changes from an I-beam to an arrow and click once; to highlight a
paragraph, double-click in the left margin. <Ctrl>-click in text to
select that sentence. To select a longer block of text, click once in the
left margin at the top of the block, hold down <Shift>, and click once at
the bottom. To highlight the whole megillah, <Ctrl>- click in the left
margin. And to select columns, click and drag with the right mouse
button.

Customizing the Tool Bar

Customize your tool bar correctly, and you may never have to pull down a
menu again. Select <Alt>OOT to get to the Toolbar Options dialog box.
Here you can assign an icon to any command or macro in WinWord's arsenal
and place it on the tool bar. Simply click Commands or Macros in the Show
box, scroll down the list of commands or macros, click on the one you
want to add, scroll through the Button list box, and pick an appropriate
icon. In the Tool to Change list box, choose an icon you want to replace
or choose a [space], put the new icon on an empty space on the bar. Click
Change- Close and the new button will appear.

So which icons should you add to your tool bar? Here are five I can't
live without: ViewZoom, which lets me shrink and expand my document view;
DocumentStatistics, for an instant word and character count, as well as
info on editing time and revisions; ControlRun, which takes me to the
Windows Clipboard or Control Panel; ViewPage, for instant print previews;
and InsertPageNumbers, for-well, you can probably figure it out.

Key Consciousness

WordPerfect runs fastest with function keys, which are easier to learn if
you lay the program's template on your keyboard and stick the color-coded
decals on the <Ctrl>, <Alt>, and <Shift> keys. I also find it easier to
memorize WordPerfect's commands by using the menus' mnemonic letter
choices.

WordPerfect was designed around the <Home>, <End>, and cursor keys on the
numeric keypad. If you turn off Num Lock and use the numeric keypad
rather than the inverted-T cursor keys, you'll save your fingers a lot of
labor. Also, train yourself to use <Ctrl>-<Right> and <Ctrl>-<Left>,
which move you forward and backward one word at a time, and <Gray Plus>
and <Gray Minus> keys on the numeric keypad, which move you forward and
backward one screen at a time.

Cursor Control

Another set of navigation shortcuts uses the <Home> key to bolster the
effect of the cursor keys. The more often you hit <Home>, the more
extreme the effect: <Home><Up> moves the cursor to the top of the screen;
<Ctrl>-<Home><Up> to the top of the current page; <Home><Home><Up> to the
top of the document; and <Home><Home> <Home><Up> to the top of the
document before any hidden codes. Similarly, <Home><Left> moves to the
left of the screen; <Home><Home><Left> to the beginning of the line (if
you're using a small font or wide paper, a line may be several screens
wide); and <Home><Home><Home><Left> to the beginning of the line before
any codes. (<Down> and <Right> use the same key combos, but it's faster
to use <End> than <Home> <Home><Right>.)

You can move the cursor to a specific page in a document by pressing Go
To (<Ctrl>-<Home>) and entering a page number. Pressing <Ctrl>-<Home>
twice returns you to where you last entered a major navigation command.
To move around when editing, use <Search> (<F2>) to jump to exactly the
right spot: Press <Search>, type the text that appears before the letter
you want the cursor to land on, and press <Search> again.

Around the Block

When you cut a block, WordPerfect tells you to 'Move cursor; press Enter
to retrieve'. If it makes more sense to clean up around the cut before
moving elsewhere to paste, press <F1> (Cancel). The prompt goes away and
you can edit freely. So long as you don't use the Copy or Move commands,
the cut text is still in memory; to retrieve it, position the cursor and
press <Ctrl>-<F4>RB.

For block moves, the time-honored trick in the WordPerfect bag is using
Undo (<F1>). Delete the text you want to move, position the cursor where
you want to paste it, and press <F1>R (Undoo Restore).

Delete Delight

To delete a single word, position the cursor anywhere on it and press
<Ctrl>-<Backspace>; press it repeatedly to delete additional words. To
delete to the end of a line, press <Ctrl>-<End>; continue to hold down
these keys to quickly delete to the end of the current paragraph.

Quick-Change Formats

If you apply a format like Italics from the Font-Appearance menu,
WordPerfect inserts hidden start and end codes: [ITALC] and [italc]. You
don't have to go back to the menu to turn off the format when typing; the
characters you type subsequently are inserted between the codes. Press
<Right> to move past the end code.

Keyboard Cut-Ups

I believe in equal rights, so I use a mouse for some things and a
keyboard for others. The mouse is great for clicking on the Button Bar or
selecting text (to select a word, place the cursor on it and
double-click; click three times to select a sentence, four times to
select a paragraph). But memorize the following few keystrokes, and
you'll be racing through your documents faster than the favorite at
Churchill Downs.

To go to the beginning of a document, press <Ctrl>-<Home>; to get to the
end, press <Ctrl>-<End>. Pressing <Ctrl>- <Delete> deletes text to the
end of a line; <Ctrl>- <Backspace> deletes a word. Press <Ctrl>-G<Tab>
<Tab> <Enter> if you want to return the cursor to the last position you
moved it to using a feature such as GoTo, Replace or Home.

Most of us know the time-honored shortcuts, like <Ctrl>-Z for undo, <Ctrl
>-X for cut, <Ctrl>-C for copy, and <Ctrl>-V for paste. Not everyone
knows, though, that pressing <Ctrl>- P will print the document that's on
screen without asking you to fill out a dialog box. Want to extend
highlighting to a certain character? Just press <F8> and type the
character. Want to turn boldface text (or some other different format)
back to normal? Just select it and press <Ctrl>-N to return to normal
text. And press <Ctrl>-W to access special symbols such as foreign
characters and accent marks.

No More Dialog Dallying

Using a mouse to make selections in a dialog box is like shooting peas
with a cannon. Instead, wend your way through dialog boxes by pressing
<Tab> or by holding down <Alt> and pressing the underlined letter of the
area or button you want. To open a pop-up list, move to the list button
and press <Alt>-<Down> or <Alt>-<Up>. Type the underlined letter in an
item's name to move directly to it. And although you can move to a check
box and press <Space> to check or uncheck it, and you can move to a radio
button list and use <Up> or <Down> to make your selection, in both cases,
using <Alt>underlined letter is faster.

Quick Lists

To avoid wasting time searching through file names, I always set up a
Quick List of files and directories. Select File- Open, check the Quick
List box if necessary, select Edit- Quick List and then add the documents
and directories you use most often. (To switch between a Quick List and
the regular directory list in the File Open Dialog Box, press <Alt>-Q to
check and uncheck the Quick List box.)

A Better View

WordPerfect for Windows' Viewer window shows you what's in a file without
actually opening it. Choose File-Open, select the file name, and then
click the View button or press <Alt>-V for a sneak preview. To see what's
in another file in the directory, click it or cursor to it.

Macro Magic

WordPerfect for Windows lets you use your favorite macros with the click
of a button. Once you've recorded a series of commands as a macro and
named it, place it on the Button Bar where you can get to it quickly:
Select View-ButtonBarSetup- Edit, select Assign Macro to Button, choose
the macro from the list, click Assign and voila! The macro shows up on
the button bar. When you're finished adding macros, click OK.

Working Smart in 1-2-3

Release 2.x and 3.x

Make an End of It

If I could see all 8192 rows by 256 columns in my 1-2-3 spreadsheets, I'd
be looking at a screen more than 7 yards wide and 61 yards long. With so
much spreadsheet real estate at hand, it's worthwhile knowing how to get
around.

I use the <End> key to jump almost anywhere in my spreadsheet with
lightning speed. For example, press <End>- <Home>, and the cell pointer
jumps to the bottom right corner of the active worksheet. (If that cell
happens to be cell K50, you can be sure there are no entries or
formatting in any of the cells in columns L through IV and in rows 51
through 8192.) Press <End>-<Right> starting on a blank cell, and the cell
pointer stops at the next nonblank cell to the right of that cell. If
there are no nonblank cells, it shoots all the way to column IV. (If you
start on a nonblank cell, the cell pointer stops at the last nonblank
cell in that series.)

The <End> key works the same way with the other cursor keys, and that
makes finding the beginning and end of data series remarkably fast and
easy. (Note: Using <End> plus the cursor keys is a good way to check
whether a row or column is empty before you delete it.)

You can also review your spreadsheet one screen at a time, if you like,
vertically or horizontally. Vertical is easy: Use <Page Up> and <Page
Down>. Press <Ctrl>-<Left> or <Ctrl>-<Right> to move the cursor a
screenful to the left or right for a horizontal view.

Forming Formulas

Once you master navigation in spreadsheet land, you can use those skills
to build mathematical formulas. When entering a formula that calls for a
range argument, you can select the range in the spreadsheet to enter it
automatically. For example, if you type SUM(, you can then press the
cursor keys to move the cell pointer to the top of a column of values.
Press the period key to anchor the range. Then press <End>-<Down> to
select the whole column of values for summation. To finish, type the
closing parenthesis and press <Enter>.

Slash and Print

To print a fast draft of your spreadsheet, use the /Print command. You
won't get any formatting or graphics, but /Print prints much faster than
the :Print command in 1-2-3's Wysiwyg add-in.

When using Wysiwyg, know thy printer driver. If you're printing draft
copies of graphics or ranges with lots of formatting, choose a driver
that prints at medium or low resolution-between 75 and 150 dots per inch
(dpi). For better quality, try a 300-dpi driver like the HPLASR4 or the
XHPLJ2C driver. (The XHPLJ2C driver is generally faster because it
downloads fonts, while the HPLASR4 does not.) To switch between available
drivers while using release 2.4, choose the :Print-Config-Printer
command. In release 3.1+, select :Print-Configuration-Resolution-Draft.

If you need to print many reports but don't want to wait around, try
printing to encoded files and then printing the files later. Create an
encoded file by selecting /Print- Encoded. To print to an encoded file,
select :Print-File and enter a file name with ENC as the extension (say,
92END1.ENC). After you've created an ENC file, you can print it by typing
COPY /B filename.ENC PRN at the DOS prompt. The resulting report looks
exactly like one printed from within 1-2-3, complete with fancy
formatting and graphics. You can even use wild cards to print multiple
ENC files: For example, type COPY /B *.ENC PRN at the DOS prompt to print
all the ENC files in the current directory.

Working Smart in 1-2-3 for Windows

Get Smart

Talk about choice: If you're used to DOS versions of 1-2-3, you can
always press the slash key to go to the 1-2-3 Classic menu. Pressing the
colon key even displays the Wysiwyg formatting menu. But hey, you're in
Windows. Why not do yourself a favor by using SmartIcons and other
features unique to the Windows version?

The SmartIcon palette is a veritable warehouse of shortcuts you can
customize to fit your way of working. To customize your SmartIcons,
choose Tools-SmartIcons and click the Customize button. You'll see the
current SmartIcon palette in a list box next to a Standard icons list
box. Scroll through the latter list, click on an icon, and you get a
description of the function in the Description box below it. If you find
an icon you like, double-click it to add it to your current palette. (A
few of my favorite SmartIcons are Cycle through colors for backgrounds,
Copy current cell into selected cells, Insert rows, and Insert columns.)
To make room for your new icons, jump over to the Current palette box and
double-click the icons you don't want. When you're satisfied with your
new palette, click OK to save it.

Cell Block

Chances are, you issue a command like Style-Font and then select the
range of cells to which it applies. But if you select a range before you
issue a command, the selection remains active after the command is
executed, making it easier to perform another operation on the same
range.

Help Where You're At

Here's an easy way to get help with @functions. When you need to enter an
@function, press @ and then <F3> for a list of all functions. Press <F1>
for the @Function Index. (You can follow a similar procedure when
entering macro commands. Enter a left brace { and press <F3> for a list
of all macro commands. <F1> displays the Macro Command Index.)

Peace Be Undo You

If you've blown it, you can back out with the Undo command. (First select
Tools-User Setup and make sure Enable Edit Undo is checked.) Issue the
Undo command by selecting Edit- Undo (or pressing <Alt>-<Backspace>). If
you select Undo after executing a macro, your worksheet will be restored
to its previous condition.

Working Smart in Excel 4.0

Be a Copycat

What's the best way to save time building spreadsheets? Build something
once and copy it. With Excel, I enter multiple copies of a formula or a
value in a single step: First, I select the range(s) where I want the
copies to go (holding down <Ctrl> and using the mouse to select multiple
blocks of cells); then I build my first formula and press <Ctrl>-<Enter>.
Every cell in the selection gets a copy.

To copy a formula or row of formulas to lower cells, select that formula
or row and the target range, then press <Ctrl>- D. To copy a formula or
column of formulas to cells to the right, select that formula or column
and the target range, then press <Ctrl>-R.

And how about AutoFill? Sure, you can use it to create a series of
entries, such as days of the week. But I also copy formulas with it: I
enter the first formula, then use the mouse to drag the AutoFill handle
to cover the range that needs copies. If AutoFill makes a series when I
just want to make copies, I hold down <Ctrl> as I drag the AutoFill
handle, and I always get straight copies. Hold down <Shift> as you drag
the AutoFill handle and you'll insert blank cells, shifting adjacent
cells down or to the right.

The drag-and-drop feature lets you select and move a cell, range, row,
column, or graphics object, but hold down <Ctrl> while you drag, and
you'll drag a copy of the cell or object.

When you need to duplicate just the formatting from one range to another,
select the range, then click the Copy tool on the standard tool bar. Now
select the range to be formatted and click on the Paste Formats tool. If
you're copying a set of formulas but need to convert them to values, use
the Copy tool to make your copy, but instead of selecting Edit-Paste
Special-Values, just hold down <Shift> and click the Paste Formats tool.

You're Selected

When it comes to selecting ranges in a spreadsheet, the mouse is a pretty
blunt instrument. Instead, hold down <Shift> and use the cursor keys to
extend the range selection. The selection extends away from the active
cell. Press <Ctrl>-<Period>, to switch the active cell to each corner of
the selection, changing the extensible corner of the range. I use this
trick to adjust the corners of a selected range without canceling the
selection and starting over.

When the range is large, start on one corner, hold down <Shift><End>, and
then press a cursor key: The selection extends to the last filled cell in
that direction.

Try putting the cell pointer in a block of entries and pressing <Ctrl>
<Asterisk>. Excel selects the current block based on a pattern of
adjacent filled cells. If it guessed wrong, hold down <Shift> and use the
cursor keys and <Ctrl>- <Period> to adjust the selection.

Formula Wrestling

When formulas get complex, it can be hard to figure out how they work.
Checking the value of parts of a formula can help. Select the cell that
contains the formula, and press <F2> to edit it. Use the mouse (or <Shift
> plus the cursor keys) to select an expression, then press <F9>. Excel
calculates just that portion of the formula and converts it to a value.
Then select a more inclusive expression and repeat the process to
understand how the formula was built. (Be sure not to enter the converted
formula.)

To analyze formulas on a broader scale, try pressing <Ctrl>` (the reverse
apostrophe key is to the left of 1 key) to toggle between viewing the
values of your formulas (the normal way of looking at a spreadsheet) and
viewing the formulas themselves. If you select Window-New Window and then
press <Ctrl>`, you can compare formulas and their values side by side.
Now, select Options-Workspace, check the Info Window check box in the
Workspace Options dialog box, and click OK to see a window showing
characteristics of the active cell. Press <Alt>I to access the Info menu,
and choose the information you want, such as Precedents (the cells a
formula refers to) and Dependents (cells that contain formulas that refer
to the current cell). Now arrange your spreadsheet and Info windows so
you can see them together on screen, and you're ready to take a very
close look at your spreadsheet formulas.

Working Smart in Quattro Pro 4.0

Keyboard Clues

In some ways, DOS heavyweight Quattro Pro feels like a Windows program.
It provides 12 ways to do the same thing, such as letting me mouse around
or use the keyboard to select commands. For my taste, though, the
keyboard is faster than the mouse for selecting a block of cells.

For example, I like to select an entire current column of data (when the
cell selector is not on the top cell) by pressing <End><Up><Shift>-<F7>
<End><Down>. To select the entire current row of data when the cell
selector is not at the left edge of that data, I press <End><Left><Shift
>- <F7><End><Right>. When the cell selector isn't in the top row or left
column of the block, I select the area by pressing <End><Up><End><Left>,
then <Shift>- <F7><End><Down><End><Right>. To select the entire active
spreadsheet area, from cell A1 to the last cell that contains data, I
press <Home><Shift>-<F7><End><Home>.

Formula and Function

It's a pain to enter all those dollar signs when I'm typing absolute cell
or range addresses into formulas. Using <ABS>, the <F4> key, makes it
much easier. Type the cell or range address into the formula, then stop.
Press <ABS> one or more times to cycle the address between relative, full
absolute, row absolute, and column absolute (you can view the changes on
the input line). Then finish entering the rest of the formula as you
would normally. <ABS> also works when you are editing a formula. Position
the cursor anywhere on a cell or range address and press <ABS> to cycle
through absolutes.

The @functions are one of Quattro Pro's standbys, but who can remember
all their names? When you're entering a formula that includes an
@function, try pressing <Alt>-<F3> to display an alphabetic list of all
available functions. Scroll through the list and select a function you
want, and it is entered in your formula automatically-including the
opening parenthesis after the function name.

No More Window Pains

When you're using multiple spreadsheet windows, you can move quickly to
any of the first nine windows by holding down <Alt> and pressing the
number of the window. Can't remember the window number? Press <Shift>-<F5
> for a list of window names you can select from. If you want to view all
windows at once, press <Ctrl>-T. You can click the desired window with
the mouse to make it active. Then, to zoom the active window to full
screen, press <Alt>-<F6>.

If you like seeing your windows on the screen in a particularly
convenient configuration, you can save time by saving the configuration
as a Workspace and recalling it later. Select /File-Workspace-Save, then
enter a name for the Workspace file. To restore a saved Workspace, start
Quattro Pro with the Workspace file name as a command-line argument (Q
MYCONFIG, for example) or select /File- Workspace-Restore once the
application is loaded. Remember that saving the Workspace does not save
the data in the windows; you must use /File-Save in each window to save
the spreadsheet data.

Beat the Oops! Blues

To keep your file intact, nothing beats a regular save (<Ctrl>-S or
/File-Save), of course. But what can you do to reverse individual errors
in your worksheet? Undo 'em. To enable the Undo feature, select
/Options-Other-Undo-Enable. If you make a mistake, press <Alt>-<F5> or
select /Edit-Undo to reverse it. Be aware that Undo takes some memory and
slows down some operations, so you may want to enable it only when you're
working on unfamiliar or complex tasks.

Working Smart in CorelDraw 3.0

Elect Select

Everybody knows CorelDraw is full of great tools for drawing and type
manipulation. But CorelDraw is also full of humbler but equally useful
shortcuts for selecting text.

For example, let's say you're using the Text tool to edit a page. To
select a word, double-click it; to select a sentence hold down <Ctrl> and
click it, to select a string of text click one end, hold down <Shift>,
and click the other end.

To move the insertion point within a text block, use the cursor keys;
press <Home> to move the insertion point to the beginning of the current
line and press <End> to move it to the end. <Ctrl>-<Home> takes it to the
beginning of a block; <Ctrl>-<End> moves it to the end of the block.
(Since it's sometimes hard to select text at the beginning of a block by
clicking and dragging over it, try clicking anywhere in the block,
pressing <Ctrl>-<Home>, then holding down the <Shift> key and clicking at
the place you want the selection to end.)

Face-Lifts

If Corel's default text font (24-point Avalon) isn't to your liking, you
can change it permanently by using the Windows Notepad to edit the
CORELDRW.INI file, located in your CorelDraw program directory. Find the
line that reads 'DefaultFont=Avalon, 1,24' in the [CDrawConfig] section,
and change 'Avalon' to the name of any PostScript font (provided you have
Adobe Type Manager or a PostScript printer) or TrueType font installed on
your system. The next setting, after the comma, lets you specify the
weight of the default font: 1 for normal, 2 for bold, 4 for italic, or 8
for bold italic. The final setting is the point size.

You can save time in a Corel session by setting the font for the current
insertion point. Just click on a blank part of the page with the Text
tool. Then choose the desired typeface and size in the Text roll-up (or
Character Attributes dialog box) and click Apply. When you type, the text
appearing at the insertion point will be the one you specified. But the
next time you click on a blank area of the page to make a new insertion
point, it will revert to the default.

To set a default face for an entire session, choose the Pick tool, making
sure no text block is selected, and define the desired attributes in the
dialog box; click OK to confirm and all new insertion points will be in
the face you chose. (The next time you run CorelDraw, it will revert to
the default face in the INI file.)

Path-Ology

Text attached to a path is linked to that path dynamically- you can
modify the text or the path separately without having to detach them from
each other. The trick: Hold down the <Ctrl> key and click on the text to
select it. You're now free to format or edit it as you would any text
block.

It's also easy to create and manipulate type. Let's say you're tightening
the spacing between the letters of some large display type to make it
easier to read. Try selecting the character and nudging it by pressing
the appropriate cursor key until it's in place. (In this case, I make
sure the Nudge value in the Preferences dialog box is set to only 1 or 2
points.) You can also move multiple characters by holding down the <Shift
> key while selecting them, or by dragging a selection marquee around
them.

Conversions and Reversions

There's a faster way to convert existing text from paragraph to artistic
mode, and vice versa. Instead of changing mode and retyping, choose the
Text tool, select the paragraph, and choose Edit*Copy. Then switch to the
Pick tool and choose Edit*Paste to create a new artistic text block. You
can go the other way by selecting a block of artistic text and choosing
Edit*Copy, then clicking and dragging with the Text tool to create a new
frame, and then choosing Edit*Paste. Remember: For this tip to work, you
have to use the Text tool to select the text.

Working Smart in Harvard Graphics 3.x

Default Is Mine

I never bother hunting around for charts and presentations. Instead, I
set up a default directory that tells the program exactly where my files
are. At the main menu, I select Setup-Program defaults and press <Enter>
three times to get to Directories Defaults (in the Program defaults
screen). Then I change any of the default directories-for Data, Import,
and Work files, for example-to the directories where I keep those types
of files.

Do the Keyboard Shuffle

Whenever you finish a task using the keyboard, such as typing text in a
form, press <F10> to get to the next menu, or press <Esc> to return to
the previous screen. If you're using a mouse and you've finished a task,
just press the right button to continue.

And if you forget Harvard's litany of keystroke shortcuts while working
on a chart-such as <Ctrl>-N to edit notes, <Ctrl>-B to insert fractions
and other special characters, and <Ctrl>-P to print a chart-there's an
easier way to remember them. Just press <Ctrl>-<F1> to produce a pop-up
list of keyboard shortcuts.

Stop Mousing Around

When I'm using the Draw feature, it's often faster to use keyboard
shortcuts than to mouse around. To select an editing tool, type the first
letter of the tool's name-say, C for Copy, P for Paste, G for Group, or U
for Ungroup-and then press <Enter>. For tools that start with the same
letter-such as Delete, Duplicate, and Disconnect-I press the letter
repeatedly until the tool I want is highlighted, and then press <Enter>.

You can also use the <Ctrl> key in combination with letter keys to bypass
pulldown menus or select another drawing tool. For example, <Ctrl>-G gets
you a chart, <Ctrl>-S saves a chart, and <Ctrl>-U gives you Undo. Press
<Ctrl>-T to toggle between the Text tool and the Select tool.

It's a Draw

I hate having to wait for Harvard to redraw an entire chart every time I
make a change. For top-speed redraw, press <F8>1 to access the Redraw
options list, set the redrawing quality to draft, and select No for all
of the other display options (they control gradients, bit maps,
subcharts, and button names). You can cancel a Redraw in progress by
hitting <Esc> and restart the redraw by pressing <Ctrl>-D.

Zippy Printing

To improve printing speed for draft copies, try the following tips.

1. From the main menu, select Setup-Printer 1 (assuming Printer 1 is your
draft printer) to open the Printer 1 Setup menu. Select Yes for Use
Spooler (which gets you back to work in Harvard faster) and Draft for
Quality.

2. When working on a chart, press <Ctrl>-P (to print) and <F8> to open
the Printer Options menu. Select No for Draw background color. If your
printer comes with built-in fonts, select Yes for the Use Hardware Fonts
Only option.

Working Smart in PageMaker

A Zoom With a View

I find that PageMaker does my bidding most successfully if I treat
keyboard and mouse as equal partners. At first, it was a little like
learning to drive with a stick shift, but with a little effort, <Shift
>-clicking, <Ctrl>-dragging, and other combined operations became second
nature.

For example, to toggle between actual view (100 percent) and
fit-in-window sizes, I just click on the right mouse button. To zoom into
200 percent magnification, I hold down <Shift> while right-clicking the
mouse. To zoom out to see two facing pages and the entire pasteboard, I
hold down <Shift> while choosing Page-Fit in window or just press <Shift
>- <Ctrl>-W.

Page Pranks

Tired of the scroll bars? Don't use them. Instead, hold down <Alt> and
drag to access the grabber-hand pointer, which lets you move the page in
any direction. And don't bother messing with the page icons when you want
to turn a page. Instead, press <F12> to move forward a page and <F11> to
move back one. To go to a specific page, press <Ctrl>-G, enter the page
number, and press <Enter>.

Story Time

Mice are great for selecting text, but you can also use the text tool and
double-click on a word to select it, or triple-click to select a
paragraph. Press <Ctrl>-A to select all the text in the current story.

If you prefer to keep your hands on the keyboard, hold down <Shift>-<Ctrl
> and press <Right> or <Left> to select the next or previous word.
Pressing <Shift>-<Ctrl> with <Up> or <Down> selects entire paragraphs.

To check spelling or to search and replace characters, triple-click a
text block with the Arrow tool or press <Ctrl>-E to enter the Story
Editor, then choose Edit- Spelling or press <Ctrl>-L. If your insertion
point is blinking inside the story already, press <Ctrl>-E. Press <Ctrl
>-E again to return to the layout view.

Editing With Style

Style sheets are real work-savers. Any time you format a paragraph of
text, save it to a style sheet so you can reapply the formatting to other
paragraphs easily. Assuming the Style palette is available (<Ctrl>-Y),
just hold down <Ctrl> while clicking on the No style option to define a
new style. If you ever want to edit the style sheet-and consequently
reformat all text associated with that style- <Ctrl>-click on its name in
the Style palette.

Grappling With Graphics

There's no substitute for the mouse when selecting graphics. But when one
graphic overlaps another, or when text and graphics overlap, the mouse
isn't enough. Instead, press <Ctrl>-click to select the top object (text
block or graphic) in a stack, <Ctrl>-right click again to select the next
one down, and so on until you select the object you want. When you drag
that object, it automatically moves to the front of the stack.

If you use photographic scans and other bit-mapped images (PCX or TIFF
files), remember this trick: To ensure that the resolution of your
imported image matches the resolution of your final output device-so you
don't get any unsightly patterns showing up in your pictures-select the
printer model using the File*Target printer command, then hold down
<Shift>-<Ctrl> and drag a corner handle of the image to scale it.

Tooling Around

Here's a tip that will elevate you from PageMaker novice to all-around
pro. Close the Toolbox-it consumes too much valuable space on screen-and
assign the following keyboard equivalents to the inner recesses of your
personal memory banks.

To select the Text tool, press <Shift>-<F4>. To toggle back to the Arrow
tool, press <F9>. You can access the other tools from the keyboard as
well-<Shift>-<F2> selects the Line tool, <Shift>-<F8> gets the Crop
tool-but how often do you use them? For most situations, <Shift>-<F4> and
<F9> are all you need.

Working Smart in dBASE IV

Strings Attached

With dBASE, I get an eclectic menu of working environments- the Control
Center, the infamous dot prompt, a group of interactive form designers,
and a built-in programming language. One key to working smarter with
dBASE is to take advantage of what each mode has to offer.

Because dBASE has a built-in programming language, it offers a wide array
of functions that let me carry out specialized calculations and data
transformations. (Even if you're allergic to programming, you can use
these functions to manipulate dates and character strings.)

For example, I sometimes use the UPPER() function to convert a string to
all uppercase. To print a name field in uppercase on a report, I add the
expression UPPER(Name) to the report, and to index on the state,
regardless of how the state abbreviation was entered, I use the
expression UPPER(State) in the index key expression.

The TRIM () function removes trailing blank spaces from a string. You can
use this function to combine strings on reports and labels and avoid
unsightly gaps that would result from partly empty fields, as in the
expression TRIM(City) + ", " + State + " " + ZIP. For example, you can
use an array of date manipulation functions to format dates on reports,
including CDOW(duedate), which evaluates to the day of the week, spelled
out (for example, 'Tuesday') and CMONTH(duedate), which yields the name
of the month.

Index Fingers

dBASE can index on a field of any data type, but when you combine fields
of different data types, you can use functions to convert all of them to
character strings. For example, to index a transaction file on a
character field called IDCODE, and within each IDCODE group, by a date
field called TRANDATE, you can use the DTOS function (which converts a
date to a character string in year/month/day order to achieve correct
chronological order) in an expression like Idcode + DTOS(Trandate). To
index in reverse chronological order, you need a more complicated
expression that subtracts the date from an arbitrary future date later
than any you anticipate in your database (say, December 31, 1999). The
subtraction yields the number of days between the two dates, and this
number will be smaller for later dates; those which will fall earlier in
indexed order. To combine this numeric result with a character field, you
can use the STR function to convert it to a four-digit number, as
follows: Idcode + STR({12/31/99} - Trandate, 4).

Go Dotty

If you are new to dBASE and have been working exclusively in the menu
system, you can work a lot faster with the dot prompt commands than you
can using the menu-driven Query by Example (QBE). For example, to compute
more than one summary statistic based on the same field, you must add two
copies of the database to the query. Using the CALCULATE command at the
dot prompt, you can carry out multiple calculations easily. The formula
CALCULATE MIN(Trandate), MAX(Trandate), SUM(Amount), AVG(Amount),
MAX(Amount) calculates the earliest and latest transaction dates and the
sum, average, and maximum transaction amounts.

Instead of using QBE exclusively to carry out inquiries based on multiple
databases, you can open and link the files at the dot prompt using the
USE, SET RELATION TO, and SET SKIP TO commands. These let you link
databases based on any expression, not just a field or index present in
both files. For example, you could link a name and address database to a
transaction file that's indexed, like the expression described above, on
a character field and a date. To accomplish this from the dot prompt,
open both databases, each in its own numbered work area and with the
transaction field ordered on the combined character and date index (in
this example, called IdDate):

SELECT 1

USE Names ORDER StateId

SELECT 2

USE Trans ORDER IdDate

To establish the link, use a SET RELATION command executed from the work
area you want to be active, followed by a SET SKIP command if the
relationship is one-to-many:

SELECT 1

SET RELATION TO Idcode INTO Trans

SET SKIP TO Trans

After some experience working at the dot prompt, you'll be surprised at
the power, speed, and flexibility you'll gain.

Working Smart in Paradox 4.0 for DOS

Field Flux

I love Paradox's report designer but there's no easy way to copy and move
fields. Here are a few quick tricks to increase efficiency.

To copy a calculated field, use the Instant Scripts feature. First I
position the cursor where I want the field and press <Alt>-<F3> to start
recording. Next, I use Field*Place* Calculated to create the calculated
field. When the field is in place, I press <Alt>-<F3> again to stop
recording the script. Then I move the cursor to the next place I want to
use the same field (or a similar one) and press <Alt>-<F4> to run the
script and create a new field. If I need to change the expression, I use
Field-Reformat.

If you need to move a field at the left margin to the end of the previous
line in a free-form report, press <Insert> to go into Insert mode, place
the cursor at the beginning of the line and press <Backspace>. And in
tabular reports, save time by pressing <Ctrl>-R to rotate a column just
like when you are viewing a table and pressing <Tab> or <Shift>- <Tab> to
move the cursor from column to column.

A New Image

Sometimes you'd like to see a different form than the default F form that
Paradox uses when you press <F7>, or use the Form Speedbar button. To
change the default, use Image- PickForm to show the form you want to use,
and then Image- KeepSet.

There's no rule that says you have to keep the standard R report in its
original form. If you want to print a different report when you press
<Alt>-<F7>, you can copy the report of your choice to the R slot using
Tools-Copy-Report- SameTable.

Edit, CoEdit

Paradox's hot-keys in Edit and CoEdit mode make it easy to edit tables
fast. <Ctrl>-<Backspace> erases an entire field; <Ctrl>-D copies a field
value from the previous record into an empty field, and <Ctrl>-F, <Alt>-
<F5>, or a double-click of the mouse button, brings you into Field View,
where you can readily change a field value without having to erase it
first.

If you make a mistake, you can use Undo (<Ctrl>-U) to reinsert a deleted
record, delete an inserted record, or return an edited record to its
original state. <F9> brings you into Edit mode when a table is in your
work space; similarly, <Alt>-<F9> or the CoEdit button on the Speedbar
puts you into CoEdit. You can move freely between table windows while
editing or coediting by pressing <F3>, <F4>, or <Ctrl>-<F4>.

ValCheck It Out

When it comes to data entry, the ValCheck feature is an ideal time-saver.
You can use it to do things like fill in and format values and check
against lookup tables. To add ValChecks to a table while you're editing,
choose ValCheck*Define while in Edit mode.

Spacebar, the Final Frontier

Why waste time typing in dates in the Date field? Instead, when you're in
the default mm/dd/yy format, just press <Space> to fill in the current
month, tap again for the current day, and tap a third time to fill in the
year.

Sort It Out

If you've been relying on the Sort command to order records for a report,
you have to use it every time you run your report. It's much easier to
use the Group command in Report mode. Groupings always override the
sorted order of the underlying report table, and you have to add them to
your report design only once.

Working Smart in Quicken 6.0

Quick Starts

I like Quicken because among other things, it lets me work fast. I can
load files automatically, change between accounts, and use some easy
keyboard shortcuts to get my accounting over and done with.

For example, let's say I know the account I'm going to use- call it
'Cash92'-I just type Q Cash92 at the DOS prompt, and Quicken loads it
automatically. If I have more than one file, I type the account name
followed by a space and the file name. For example, Q Wells Business gets
me into my Business file and Wells account.

Jump Shots

Quicken's shortcut keys let you jump from one place to another with
amazing agility. For example, you can assign a Quick Key number to each
of nine accounts and change accounts fast by holding down <Ctrl> and
pressing the corresponding number. It's easy to copy a transaction within
the same account or to another account in the same file: Press <Ctrl>-
<Insert> on the transaction you want to copy and paste it into an empty
transaction with <Ctrl>-<Insert>.

Fiddling with the register's date field when entering data that's very
old gets, well, kind of old. Try T for today, and M for the beginning of
the month. It's even better to use Quicken's Quick Calendar: Press <Ctrl
>-K to pop it up, scroll to the date you want, and press <F9> to paste it
in.

Why plow through a half-dozen keystrokes to create the same report each
session? Once the report's on screen, memorize it with <Ctrl>-M. Forgot
to memorize it? Use <Ctrl>-Z to call up the last report you used.

Say you're in a cash flow report and want to figure out how $10,000 got
into the Miscellaneous category, before your boss does. With your cursor
on a particular figure, press <Ctrl>-Z to display the list of the
transactions that produce the total amount.

Want to recategorize an item? Press <F9> to get back to the Register,
<Ctrl>-T to get to the list, and <Ctrl>-E to change the category. <Ctrl
>-Z zaps you back to the report.

Bill Time

Do you pay the same bills at the same time every month? There's no need
to remember the date or the categories these bills fall into. Quicken
will batch your memorized transactions, remind you when they're due , and
enter the entire group into your register. All you have to do is enter
the amount of each bill and print them. From the Register, press <Ctrl>-J
and just fill in the blanks.

Filling It Up

You probably take advantage of QuickFill-Quicken's database of every
check you write-to fill in transaction fields automatically. But creating
memorized transactions for regular events can be done even more quickly.
Because I do most of my banking through convenient automated teller
machines, I've created some memorized transactions for the typical
amounts I withdraw. For example, when I press 1 from the Payee field,
QuickFill brings up '100ATM' and 6 gets '60ATM,' each with the correct
amount of the transaction already filled in.

Transfer Tricks

It's easy to transfer between accounts in Quicken. Say you are thinking
of selling your house, so you keep careful track of all home improvement
expenditures and add them to the base cost of your house.

The easiest way to go about doing this is to set up a new account, let's
say, Home Improve, choose Other Asset for the type of account, and enter
the price you paid for your house. The next time you pay for something
that's considered a legitimate home improvement, choose your Home Improve
account and you'll automatically tally the improvement into the increased
value of your house.

Title:     Team 1-2-3 with your word processor for effective reports;
           here's how you can easily import data into your WordPerfect,
           Word, or Ami Pro document.
             (includes related articles on linking techniques and
             formatting spreadsheet data in reports) (Lotus: Getting the
             Most from 1-2-3 & Other Lotus Software)
Author:    Kenny, Catherine


Abstract:  Techniques are described for importing spreadsheet data into
           word processing documents for inclusion in reports. After
           linking a 1-2-3 worksheet with a word processor, the data need
           not be reentered, but while the numeric format of the 1-2-3
           data is imported as well, WYSIWYG formatting may not make the
           transition. Character formatting applied to the 1-2-3 data in
           a word processor is wiped out every time the spreadsheet data
           is updated, but many word processors let users define styles
           and apply them to data, which makes it easy to reapply formats
           after the report is updated. The two ways to bring data into a
           word processor are by importing it and by linking it:
           importing data essentially copies it into the word processing
           document, while linking it allows the linked data to remain
           connected to the worksheet rather than becoming part of the
           document. Which technique to use for specific situations and
           the linking and importing features of popular word processing
           programs are described.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full Text:

In 1-2-3 you can do a lot of things well, but you can't do everything.
When you need to merge your 1-2-3 worksheet data into a company report,
memo, or newsletter, you're better off creating the document in a word
processor and then bringing in the spreadsheet data.

1-2-3 lacks the word processing power to create anything more complex
than a simple one-page report. For example, 1- 2-3 lacks a spelling
checker, doesn't let you set important formats such as line spacing and
paragraph indentations, and can't handle more than one page of text.
Almost any word processing program, on the other hand, lets you
manipulate text and numbers in virtually any way imaginable. Bringing
your spreadsheet data into your word processor lets you apply all that
power so you can create professional-looking reports with the numbers
generated in 1-2-3.

Sophisticated links mean that once you link a 1-2-3 worksheet with your
word processor, you never have to reenter the data. Suppose you linked
the data in a large budget worksheet to a monthly report. As you change
the worksheet's numbers, the numbers in the report change automatically.

Be forewarned, however, that while the numeric format of your 1-2-3 data
travels with it, Wysiwyg formatting may be left behind. And any character
formatting you apply to the 1-2-3 data in your word processor gets wiped
out each time you update the spreadsheet data. On the other hand, many
word processors let you define styles and apply those to the data, making
it easy to reapply the formats after the report has been updated.

Combining worksheet data with a word processing document is easy because
1-2-3 is a de facto standard, which means that most word processors make
special provisions for 1-2-3 data. To demonstrate just how easy it is,
we'll show you how to combine 1-2-3 data with documents created in
WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS and Windows, Microsoft Word 5.5 for DOS,
Microsoft Word for Windows 2.0, and Ami Pro 3.0.

There are two ways to bring worksheet data into your word processor:
importing and linking. When you import data, you are essentially copying
it into the word processing document. The data becomes part of the
document. If you later change the data in the worksheet, those changes
will not be reflected in the document.

Linked data remains connected to the worksheet rather than becoming part
of the document. When you link worksheet data to a word processing
document, you can view a -copy' of the 1-2-3 data through the document.
If you change the linked data in the worksheet, the data in the document
will reflect those changes. But if you change the data in your word
processor, it will be replaced by the worksheet data the next time the
worksheet is updated. If you delete the worksheet, the document will no
longer contain the linked data.

Which method should you use to combine data with a report? That depends
on the type of data in your worksheet. If the data is relatively static,
you're better off importing it. For example, if you're creating a report
that uses the sales figures from the past two years, you should import
those figures since they won't change. Linking makes more sense when
you're working with data that's likely to change. Reports highlighting
cumulative sales figures, for example, should contain linked data.

DOS word processors can read data from both DOS and Windows spreadsheets,
although the methods differ slightly. When you import worksheet data into
a DOS word processor, it arrives as delimited ASCII text, stripped of
attributes and separated by tab stops.

WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS. The top-selling DOS word processor accepts 1-2-3
data without a hitch. WordPerfect recognizes the individual sheets in a
multisheet file, and it lets you import specific named ranges. You can
import data as delimited text or as a table with the same column and row
format as the source worksheet. Either way, only minimal reformatting is
needed to create a usable document.

To import 1-2-3 worksheet data into a WordPerfect document, position the
cursor and select File-Text In-Spreadsheet- Import. Select Filename from
the Spreadsheet Import screen, and enter the path name of the file.
Select Range and indicate the range you want to import. Choose Type and
indicate Table or Text. Finally, select Perform Import. Figure 1 shows
worksheet data imported into WordPerfect as a table.

Links between 1-2-3 data and WordPerfect documents are also easy to
create and maintain. To create a link, select File- Text
In-Spreadsheet-Create Link. Select Filename from the Spreadsheet Import
screen, and enter the path name of the file that contains the data you
want to link. Select Range and indicate the range you want to link.
Select Type and choose Table or Text, then select Perform Link.
WordPerfect inserts codes at the beginning and end of the linked data
identifying the source file and range. To update the linked data, choose
File-Text In-Spreadsheet-Link Options- Update All Links. WordPerfect
replaces the data between the codes with updated data.

If you want the linked data to be updated every time you retrieve the
WordPerfect document, select File-Text In- Spreadsheet-Link Options and
set the Update on Retrieve option to Yes.

Microsoft Word 5.5. Microsoft Word offers most of WordPerfect's importing
and linking capabilities, with a few important exceptions. Word can't
import or link spreadsheet data as a table, and it doesn't automatically
update linked data.

To import 1-2-3 data into a Word document, select Insert- File. In the
resulting dialog box's File text box, enter the name of the file that
contains the data you want to import. Click the arrow in the Range text
box and indicate the range you want to import: Select All to import the
entire worksheet, indicate the sheet letter to import the entire active
sheet of a multisheet file, select an assigned range name, or type the
range address. Click OK. Word imports the data with tabs defined by the
document's current style sheet. You'll have to modify the current tab
settings to make the data presentable.

To link 1-2-3 data to a Word document, select Insert-File, use the File
and Range text boxes to enter the name of the file and range you want to
link, select Link, then click OK. Word inserts the data separated by tabs
and surrounds it with codes that mark the beginning and end of the data,
as shown in Figure 2. If these codes are not visible, select View-Layout,
View-Preferences, and Show Hidden.

To update the linked data, place the cell pointer in the area of the
document that contains the linked data, select Insert-File, and click
Update Link. Word updates all the data between the codes. You can update
multiple links in the same document by pressing <Ctrl>-5 to highlight the
entire document and selecting Insert-File-Update Link. Word stops at each
link and asks you to verify the update.

Despite all you may have heard about how hard mixing DOS and Windows
programs is, it's relatively easy to transport data between the two
environments. WordPerfect 5.1 for Windows, Microsoft Word for Windows
2.0, and Ami Pro 3.0 all provide commands that import data from DOS
releases of 1-2-3. WordPerfect for Windows and WinWord also let you link
spreadsheet data.

WordPerfect 5.1 for Windows. To import 1-2-3 for DOS data into
WordPerfect for Windows, select Tools-Spreadsheet- Import. In the Import
Spreadsheet dialog box, enter the name of the worksheet file in the
Filename box, enter the range in the Range text box, use the Range Name
list box to select the entire spreadsheet or a named range, indicate
Table or Text, and click OK.

To link the data, select Tools-Spreadsheet-Create Link and indicate the
file name and range in the resulting dialog box, as above. To update the
linked data, select Tools- Spreadsheet-Update All Links. Figure 3 shows a
link between WordPerfect for Windows and 1-2-3 for DOS data.

Microsoft Word for Windows 2.0. Spreadsheet data is easier to manipulate
and format in WinWord than in Word for DOS because it's transferred as a
table, as shown in Figure 4. To import 1-2-3 for DOS data into a WinWord
document, select Insert-File, select All Files in the List Files of Type
box, use the Drives and Directories buttons to specify the file, enter
the range address in the Range text box, and click OK. If 1-2-3 is not
already selected in the Convert File dialog box, select it from the list
and click OK.

To link 1-2-3 for DOS data to a WinWord document, select Insert-File and
enter the information as above, select Link to File, and click OK. Again,
if 1-2-3 is not selected in the Convert File dialog box, select it from
the list and click OK.

To update linked data, place the cursor anywhere in the table, select
Edit-Links, and click Update Now. To link a different range, select
Edit-Links, click Change Link, and enter the appropriate information.

Ami Pro 3.0. To import 1-2-3 for DOS data into an Ami Pro document, place
the cursor where you want to insert the data and choose File-Open. In the
File Open dialog box, click the arrow in the List Files of Type box;
select 1-2-3 if you're using release 2.x, or 1-2-3 rel 3 if you're using
3.x. Enter the path name of the file or click the appropriate drive and
directory buttons, select the file name from the Files box, and click
Insert. Indicate the import options you want in the Import dialog box. To
import a range of data, select Range and enter the range address or a
defined range name in the text box. To import the data into an Ami Pro
table, select Create Table. Figure 5 shows a range of 1-2-3 for DOS data
in an Ami Pro document.

The Windows Clipboard and Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) make it easy to
transfer data between programs. In a process similar to importing in DOS,
you can copy data from any Windows program onto the Clipboard, then paste
it into any other Windows program. DDE offers a convenient way to
establish a link between any two Windows programs.

You can use a word processor's internal File-Import commands to import
data from your worksheet, but you'll find that using the Clipboard is
much easier. You don't have to memorize the name of the file or the range
of cells you want to import. You just open both files, select the 1-2-3/W
range you want, and copy the data to the Clipboard using the Edit-Copy
command. Then switch to the word processor and paste the data into your
document by selecting Edit-Paste.

Linking is slightly more complicated. DDE establishes an active link
between two programs, which means that as long as both applications are
open at the same time, the data in the client application-the application
receiving the data-is automatically updated when you change it in the
server application. When you use the File- Import methods, you must
update the data manually.

To create a DDE link, both programs must be open and both files must be
named. If you can't access the Link commands in your word processor, take
a moment to make sure both files have a name. To steer around memory
problems that may be caused by two open Windows applications, use active
links only when necessary. Often you can shut down the server application
once the link has been established. When you want to refresh the link in
the client application, restart the server application and manually
update the link.

WordPerfect 5.1 for Windows. This program's importing and linking
commands are very similar to those in the DOS version. But the program
has trouble transferring formats, as illustrated in Figure 6. Your best
bet is to create named styles and reapply the formatting after every
update.

To establish a DDE link between your 1-2-3/W data and a WordPerfect
document, highlight the data in 1-2-3/W, select Edit-Copy, then switch to
WordPerfect. Place the cursor where the data should appear, and select
Edit-Link-Paste Link.

To change any of the link information, select Edit-Link- Edit.
WordPerfect displays the names of all the active links in the document in
the Edit DDE Link dialog box. Select the name of the link from this list,
and enter a new name for it in the New Link Name text box. Then change
the source file or data range in the Source File and Item box. The
current link information is displayed in the box in the lower right
corner of the screen. Click OK when you have finished.

Microsoft Word for Windows 2.0. This best-selling word processor does a
better job of handling spreadsheet data than WordPerfect for Windows. You
can import data from both the DOS and Windows versions of 1-2-3, and
WinWord preserves 1-2-3's numeric formatting. However, WinWord imports
only limited text formatting, and updating the source data wipes out any
formatting added in WinWord.

To get around this problem, either refrain from making formatting changes
until you're sure the 1-2-3 data won't change (which kind of defeats the
purpose of linking), or import the data as a linked graphic image.
Importing 1-2-3/W data as a graphic means you can't edit it in the word
processor, but at least this approach retains the formatting when you
change the data in 1-2-3/W. Figure 7 shows 1-2-3/W data imported as a
graphic image.

In 1-2-3/W, highlight the range you want to link, and select Edit-Copy.
Switch to WinWord, position the cursor where you want the data to appear,
and select Edit- Paste Special. The Paste Special dialog box shows the
type of data currently in the Clipboard and the formats in which the data
is available. To paste the data as a graphic, select Picture and click
Paste Link. If codes appear in your document instead of the graphic
image, select View-Field Codes to turn off the display.

Ami Pro 3.0. Despite Lotus Development Corporation's Working Together
strategy, linking 1-2-3/W data to Ami Pro leaves a lot to be desired. Ami
Pro has trouble reading numeric formats from 1-2-3/W. And although Ami
Pro imports worksheet data in a table format and transfers attributes
such as fonts, colors, and borders, the process can scramble internal
formatting. For example, in Ami Pro, values that are formatted as labels
are interpreted as values, while values with numeric formatting, such as
Currency, show up as labels. You'll need to manually adjust the data in
Ami Pro every time the data in 1-2-3/W is updated.

As in WinWord, every update wipes out formatting. The best approach here
is also to import the data as a graphic image. After you format the
1-2-3/W data, highlight the range and choose Edit-Copy. Then switch to
Ami Pro, position the cursor where you want the data to appear, select
Edit-Paste Special, indicate Windows Metafile, and click OK. Ami Pro
places a graphic image of the worksheet in the document, as shown in
Figure 8.

Linking 1-2-3 worksheet data with word processing files is relatively
easy, but it isn't foolproof. Still, with a little practice, you'll find
that it can help you to quickly create high-quality documents without
introducing any typing errors. Catherine Kenny is an assistant editor for
PC World Lotus Edition.

1. Assign a name to the range you want to link. If you add or delete
columns and rows within a named range, the data in your word processor
will be updated automatically.

2. Apply numeric formats before you import data, text formats after. In
most cases, 1-2-3's currency signs, commas, and decimal places travel
with the data. Wysiwyg formats don't, so don't waste time dressing up
your data in the spreadsheet. Use the formatting and style commands in
your word processor instead.

3. Keep linking information current. If you rename the worksheet file or
move it to another directory, you must update the linking information in
your word processor. Also, if you share your files on a network, make
sure other users know when a worksheet file is linked.

Now that you've managed to get your 1-2-3 data into your word processor,
you need to decide how you want it to look. You may be tempted to go wild
with all the new formatting options, but that could defeat your purpose.
If you apply too much formatting to your document, nothing will stand
out. The following design tips will help keep your spreadsheet data in
sync with your word processing document.

1. Add lots of space around numbers. Cramped tables are hard to read. To
set the worksheet data apart from the rest of the document, set at least
a half-inch indent or margin between the edge of the table and the text.
Also, add a line or two of space at the top and bottom of the table. If
you increase the spacing between columns and rows, make sure it's
consistent.

2. Use a typeface that works well with tabular data, such as Times Roman.
A serif font tends to produce characters that are easier to read, and
columns of data will align more evenly. If you're working with a large
block of data, however, you may find that a sans serif font such as
Helvetica has crisper-looking numbers.

3. Set the spreadsheet data a point or two smaller than the rest of the
text. Type that's between 8 and 11 points works well.

4. Separate table elements with rules. For example, a rule between the
column headings and the data emphasizes the column headings. Separating
the Total row from the data with a rule draws attention to the bottom
line. If space is tight, separate elements with lines and shading, using
the lightest shade possible and setting the underlying text in bold.

5. Use text attributes to emphasize different passages of spreadsheet
data. For example, set row headings in italics and set column headings in
boldface to help orient the reader. Just don't overdo it.

Title:     75 hot word processing tips.
             (includes related article about five universal word
             processing tips)
Author:    Campbell, George


Abstract:  Seventy-five tips for using popular word processing programs
           are presented. Tips are from contributors, companies and
           readers. Various topics are covered such as how to format a
           block of text, how to insert currency symbolism and how to
           place sections of 'boilerplate' into a document. Readers are
           advised to look at tips for programs other than the ones they
           use because their own programs probably incorporate similar
           capabilities. Programs covered include: WordPerfect 5.1 for
           Windows; Microsoft Word for Windows 2.0; Microsoft Word for
           DOS; Ami Pro 2.0 and 3.0.; and WordStar for DOS and Windows.
           Some tips are universal. They apply regardless of the
           particular program being used.

Full Text:

Today's crop of word processors are hot enough to blacken redfish.
Contemporary word crunchers like Word for Windows and Ami Pro come with
all the ingredients necessary to whip up great looking pages: prefab
templates and style sheets, built-in fonts, graphics, and other desktop
publishing-style tools.

While you can spend hours sampling all your word processor's tastiest
features, the fact remains that you need to get your work done, and soon.
That's why we've gathered 75 tips from contributors, companies, and
readers like you for the most powerful and popular programs, from the DOS
and Windows versions of WordPerfect and Microsoft Word to Ami Pro and
even WordStar.

Do you know the fastest way to format a block of text? What's the easiest
way to insert the current date, foreign currency symbols, or big hunks of
boilerplate into your documents? The answers to these and other burning
questions appear on the following pages. Whether quick keystroke shortcut
or handy macro, these tips will make your hours at the keyboard a lot
more productive.

As you try out these tricks, take a look at tips for programs you don't
use-odds are, your word processor offers a similar feature or command.
Then branch out and discover your own personal shortcuts. Before long,
you'll be cooking up your own recipes for productivity.

WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS

1. Shrink-to-Fit Printing

Need to cram more text than usual on a page to save paper? You can easily
force WordPerfect 5.1 to print text at eight or more lines per inch. The
font stays the same, but the space between lines is reduced. Issue these
keystrokes while your cursor is just before the text to be printed with
that spacing: Press <Shift>-<F8>LHF, type 1/8 (or another fractional or
decimal measurement in inches), then press <Enter><F7>. WordPerfect will
shrink the line spacing automatically. -George Campbell

2. Repeat Performance

If your job involves typing repetitive keystrokes-such as inserting a
bunch of characters or executing the same macro over and over-WordPerfect
5.x's repeat function can be a real time-saver. To repeat most
keystrokes, first press <Esc>. At the prompt, type the number of
repetitions, then press the key to repeat. For example, to insert 25
spaces, press <Esc>, type 25, and press <Space>. The more ways you find
to exploit this handy feature, the more you'll come to rely on it. -G. C.

3. Dating WordPerfect 5.1

It's easy to insert today's date into a letter or the latest revision of
a WordPerfect document. Just position the cursor, then press <Shift>-<F5
>T. Unfortunately, the program defaults to a numeric format (2/3/93). To
change the default to a more popular format (such as February 3, 1993),
you'll need to do a little more. Press <Shift>- <F5>F, then press 3<Space
>1,<Space>4<Enter> (don't forget the comma after the day of the month).
Now, press T if you want to insert the date immediately, or press <F7> to
change the default without inserting anything. Of course, you're not
limited to these two formats-you can construct others using the codes
listed in WordPerfect. -G. C.

4. Quick Character Inserts

WordPerfect 5.1's Compose feature lets you add all sorts of
foreign-language and symbolic characters to your documents, but
remembering which number codes to use when inserting them can be a chore.
Fortunately, WordPerfect provides easy-to-remember two-character codes
for the more popular characters. To insert one of these symbolic
characters, move your cursor to where you want to insert it, press <Ctrl
>-V or <Ctrl>-2 (if you use <Ctrl>-2 you won't see a prompt), and type
the appropriate character pair listed below. Be sure to type the
characters as shown here-uppercase or lowercase-or what they represent
may not appear. Since some of these characters are represented on the
editing screen by a solid box and don't always show up correctly in a
page preview, you'll have to actually print the page to make sure you
picked the right one. -WordPerfect Corp.

Type   For this Character
TM   _
OR   *
OC   *

Rx

/4   1/4
/2   1/2
-+   *
L-   *
Y=   *

P|

??   *
!!   *
<<   *
>>   *
- -   -
~~   _
==   ===
=>   _
=<   _
=/   _

5. Fast WordPerfect Getaways

Exiting WordPerfect always takes at least three keystrokes, even if you
want to get out fast. The macro in the listing below gives you a quick
one-stroke getaway. You'll have to create this macro in the macro editor
(see "Using the WordPerfect Macro Editor"). Try naming it with an
easy-to-remember keystroke combination like ALTQ.WPM. (You could also
name it ALTX.WPM, but <Alt> and x are so close together, you might press
them both at the same time and exit unintentionally. Remember: Once you
issue this macro command, there is no going back to save your file, so
make sure it's what you really want to do. -G. C.

6. Block That Text!

If you're using <Alt>-<F4> and your cursor keys to mark blocks of text
for moving or formatting, you're wasting a lot of time. For faster text
selection, use these keystrokes instead of the cursor keys.

Keystroke   Selects
Any character   Next matching character
<Space>   One word at a time
<Period>   One sentence at a time
<Enter>   One paragraph at a time
<Home><End>   One line at a time
<Home><Down>    One screen at a time
<Home><Home><Down>   End of document

To unmark a text block, press <Alt>-<F4> again. -G. C.

7. Quick Block Moves

Cutting and pasting blocks of text in WordPerfect 5.1 is a snap. Once
you've marked the block (with <Alt>-<F4> or your mouse), press <Backspace
>Y to cut it. Reposition your cursor where you want the text, then press
<F1>R to paste it. You can paste the same text inside the document as
often as you like by repeating the <F1>R keystrokes, even after typing
other text. WordPerfect stores the last three cuts, so if you want to
paste in a previous deletion, press <F1>P. When the text you want
appears, press R to paste it in. -Robert J. Lauriston

8. WordPerfect's Secret Clipboard

WordPerfect 5.1 lets you store multiple blocks of text (128 characters or
less) and then paste them throughout your document. After you type the
text, mark the block and press <Ctrl>-<Page Up>. You'll be prompted for a
variable. Type a number between 0 and 9, then press <Enter>. This stores
your block in a numbered variable during your work session. Then, anytime
you need to paste the block at the cursor, hold down <Alt> and press the
variable number-for example, <Alt>-1. You can store up to ten blocks
simultaneously using this clipboard-style technique. -G. C.

9. Figuring Fractions

While WordPerfect 5.1 lets you insert some types of fractions via its
Compose feature, they are limited to a few common numbers. When you want
to add a less common fraction, such as 3/32, you'll need to customize the
numbers using WordPerfect's subscript and superscript formatting. Here's
how to create the 3/32 example:

1. Press <Ctrl>-<F8>SP, type the numerator (3), press <Right>, then type
/.

2. Press <Ctrl>-<F8>SB, type the denominator (32), then press <Right>,
and continue typing your text. -G. C.

10. Using the WordPerfect macro editor

Usually, creating a macro is simply a matter of recording a handful of
keystrokes. Sometimes, however, you have to dig in and write one from
scratch. Some of the WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS tips that follow include
macros that you must create using WordPerfect's macro editor. Here's how
to use it.

First, you must press <Home><Ctrl>-<F10>. Then type a name for the macro
and press <Enter>, or press the desired <Alt>-key combination. Type a
description for the macro if you wish, then press <Enter>. You'll see the
macro editor screen.

In the WordPerfect macro editor, you must insert different types of
commands in different ways. To insert a command shown in boldface in the
macro below, press <Ctrl>-<Page Up>, select the command from the pop-up
list in the upper right corner of the screen, and press <Enter>. If a
command is shown underlined, press the appropriate key (for example, <F2>
for {Search}). For commands that are boldface and underlined, press <Ctrl
>-V, then the appropriate key (for example, <Ctrl>-V, then <Home> for
{Home}). Type plainly printed text as it appears.

When you've finished creating the macro, press <F7> to save the macro and
return to your editing screen. If you need to edit the macro later, press
<Ctrl>-<F10>, type the macro's name or press the <Alt>-key shortcut, then
press E at the prompt.

-G. C.

{Display Off} {ON NOT FOUND}{GO}end~~ {Home}{Home}{Up}

{LABEL}loop~ {Search}{Underline}{Search} {Block} {Search}{Underline}
{Backspace}{Underline}{Search} {Italic} {GO}loop~

{LABEL}end~ {Home}{Home}{Up} {Replace}n{Underline}{Search}{Search}

11. Hot Tabbing With WordPerfect

If you're laying out a document with a lot of evenly spaced tabs, you'll
save yourself big headaches by setting them all at once. Here's how:
Press <Shift>-<F8>LT to get to the tab setting menu, move the cursor to
the leftmost tab, then press <Ctrl>-<End> to delete the current default
settings. Now type the position of the first tab, a comma, and the
desired spacing. For example, to place the first tab one inch from the
left margin, with additional tabs set every two inches, type 1,2. Press
<Enter> and the tabs will appear. Press <F7> twice to return to your
document.

You can perform another trick to set all those automatically spaced tabs
with the same alignment, such as centered, right, or even
decimal-essential when you're creating tabbed lists of numbers. Start the
same way as above, but after pressing <Ctrl>-<End>, type just the
position for the first tab and press <Enter>. Then set that tab's
alignment by pressing L for a left tab, C for a centered tab, R for a
right tab, or D for a decimal tab. Finally, type the starting position
and spacing as described above to space your identically aligned tabs
across the page, and press <Enter> to set the tabs. Again, press <F7>
twice to finish up. -G. C.

12. Fast as a Speeding Bullet

Inserting a bullet into a WordPerfect 5.1 list or presentation chart is
quick and painless once you know the Compose shortcut. Locate the cursor
where you want the bullet, press <Ctrl>-V, then type one of the character
pairs listed below to get the bullet you want. -G. C.

Character Pair   Bullet Type
*.       o
**      o

*o

*O

13. Fast Text Reformatting

If you receive files formatted by other users, you probably long for an
easy way to change say, underlined text, to another format, such as
italic. The macro shown below will do the job automatically. (See "Using
the WordPerfect Macro Editor" for instructions on how to create macros.)
To insert the Underline command, press <F8>. For the Italic command,
press <Ctrl>-<F8>AI.

To make the macro replace other formatting in your documents, substitute
the appropriate commands (such as <F6> for boldface or <Ctrl>-<F8>AD for
double-underlining) in the appropriate places while creating the macro.
-R. J. L.

14. Memorable Text Formatting

Quick-what's WordPerfect's formatting command for double underlining? If
you answered <Ctrl>-<F8>AD, your memory's better than most. Fortunately,
by recording easy-to- remember <Alt>-key macros for the commands you use
frequently, you can avoid memorizing WordPerfect's arcane text formatting
commands. Here's how to create a macro for setting text in boldface:

1. Press <Ctrl>-<F10> to start the macro recorder.

2. Press an appropriate <Alt>-key combination to match the macro's
function, for example, <Alt>-B.

3. Type a short definition for the macro and press <Enter>.

4. Press <F6> (the formatting command for boldface).

5. Press <Ctrl>-<F10> to finish recording.

Using this process, you can define macros for all of WordPerfect's
formatting commands, substituting the appropriate keystrokes (such as
<Ctrl>-<F8>AI for italics or <F8> for underlining) in step 4. To put the
macros to work, press one of the <Alt>-key combinations while you type,
then press it again when you need to turn the formatting off. You can
also select a block of text, then press an <Alt>-key combo to format just
that block. -R. J. L.

15. Easy Views of Hard Returns

Unless you open WordPerfect's Reveal Codes window, you cannot tell
paragraph endings (hard returns) from line endings (soft returns), and
that can make formatting large blocks of text a drag. But there is a way
to force WordPerfect to mark each hard return with a small black square.

Simply press <Shift>-<F1>DEH<Ctrl>-A<F7>. The square will appear on
screen, but it will not print.

You can also use a different character as a marker. Instead of pressing
<Ctrl>-A in the sequence above, hold down <Alt> while you type an ASCII
code on your computer's numeric keypad. For example, <Alt>-20 produces a
standard typographer's paragraph marker. You can use any character you
want, but avoid normal alphanumeric characters to prevent confusion.
You'll find a complete list of ASCII codes in Appendix A of your
WordPerfect manual. -Edward L. Mills, Quincy, Illinois

21. Shadow Boxing With Graphics

WordPerfect 5.1 not only lets you create boxes for all the figures, text,
and tables in your documents, it also lets you define shadowed borders
for each box-an easy way to make items stand out. You can even create
shadows for all boxes of the same type in one shot. To try this out,
start with a document that already contains boxes, and press <Home><Home>
<Home><Up> to move the cursor to the top of the file. Now, press <Alt>-
<F9>, type the number or letter of the type of box you want shadowed,
then press OB. Choose a border type for each side of the box by selecting
from the menu options at the bottom of the screen. Use your cursor keys
to move to each side in turn. Select Thick or Extra Thick for two
adjacent sides, and Single for the other two. Press <F7> to return to
your document. The thick lines are offset for a dropped shadow effect. To
view your work, press <Shift>-<F7>V. -Robin Noe, Oak Ridge, Tennessee

22. Printing WordPerfect File Lists

Need to find a file fast? Instead of scrolling through WordPerfect's file
list one screenful at a time, you may find it faster to print out a list
of all your files at once. Here's how: Press <F5> to get to the file
list, then press <Shift>-<F7>. You'll get a printed list, formatted as it
is on the screen but including all files in the directory, not just a
screen's worth. -G. C.

23. More Formatting Shortcuts

If you work frequently with WordPerfect's Reveal Codes window (<Alt>-<F3
>) and need to edit specifications for margins, headers, graphics boxes,
and other codes, you'll appreciate a tool in version 5.1's SHORTCUT
keyboard layout. To get to it, though, you'll need to install the
alternative keyboard template, as described in the next tip.

Once you've installed SHORTCUT, press <Alt>-<F3> to open the Reveal Codes
window. Use the cursor keys to select any formatting code. Then, to edit
that code, press <Alt>-E. You'll see the menu associated with that code
instantly, and can make any changes you like. This tip saves a lot of
time, particularly when editing complex codes set in long menus, such as
column setups or graphics box layouts. -WordPerfect Corp.

24. Keyboard Alternatives

When you installed WordPerfect, you also got several customized keyboard
templates installed in your main WordPerfect directory. Each one remaps
your keyboard, offering shortcuts that can speed up various word
processing chores.

Here's a list of the supplied templates and their functions (for a
complete list of keystroke assignments for these keyboard layouts, see
Appendix H in your WordPerfect 5.1 manual):

Template   Function
ALTERNAT   Reassigns Help and Cancel keys
ENHANCED   Adds commands for 101-key keyboards
EQUATION   Keyboard shortcuts for the equation editor
MACROS   Keystrokes for 16 WordPerfect-supplied

macros

SHORTCUT   Formatting shortcut keystrokes

To choose one of these templates as the default, press <Shift>-<F1>K to
display the list, select a template using the mouse or cursor keys, then
press <Enter> twice to return to the editing screen. The template you
select becomes the default whenever you start WordPerfect.

When you want to switch back to your original keyboard template-say, to
run one of your own keystroke macros-just press <Ctrl>-6. (However, your
alternate keyboard will remain the default until you choose another using
the <Shift>-<F1>K command.) -G. C.

25. Expand Your Editing Horizons

If you're settling for WordPerfect's basic 25-by-80-line text screen, you
may be limiting your horizons unnecessarily. Users of Hercules, EGA, VGA,
and higher- resolution video boards can display up to 50 lines of text on
a single screen. In addition, some display boards even come with specific
video drivers for WordPerfect that increase the maximum number of
characters in a line. While the characters will be smaller and the lines
a little cozier, everything will still be readable.

Press <Shift>-<F1>DT, pick your display adapter type and press <Enter>.
Select the screen resolution you want, then press <Enter><F7><F7>. The
new setting you've selected becomes the default automatically. If you
don't like what you see, you can return to your basic resolution by
pressing <Shift>-<F1>DTA<F7>. -G. C.

26. Shrink Your Files

If you use graphics in WordPerfect documents, odds are you're wasting
valuable disk space. The default settings in the program cause
WordPerfect to save a copy of the graphic inside the document file. If
you reuse the same image in several documents, the program creates
separate copies of the graphic for each, eating up precious hard disk
real estate. But there's a quick fix.

To create a figure box for a graphic, press <Alt>-<F9>FC, type in a file
name, then set the positioning and other options. If you want to conserve
disk space, press O while the menu is displayed, D to select the Graphic
on Disk option, then hit <F7> to return to the document. WordPerfect will
then store a pointer to the graphic file, not the file itself, inside
your document.

Of course, if you delete the graphic file, move it to another directory,
or send the file to someone else, WordPerfect won't be able to find it if
you use this method. If that situation is likely to occur, it's best to
use the default Graphic option in the menu, which stores the graphical
data itself in the document file. -G. C.

Universal Word Processing Tips

You say you don't use any of the word processors we've covered in our 75
tips? Well, don't turn the page just yet. Here are five general tips you
can use regardless of the word cruncher you employ.

16. Protect Your Templates

Any word processor worth its salt comes with prefab templates for
creating memos, letters, or virtually any other common document. With
built-in page layout, graphics, and text specs, a template can save you
hours of design time. The problem is that it's all too easy to use a
template, fill it with your own text and graphics, and save it under its
original name-thus overwriting all your basic layout information.

The solution is simple: Make the template files read only. You'll still
be able to load it and fill it with data, but when you go to save the
file the word processor will prompt you for a new file name. The trick is
to use DOS's ATTRIB command. First, make sure the directory where
ATTRIB.EXE is stored (usually C:\DOS) is in your PATH. Then at the DOS
prompt, issue ATTRIB +R [File Specification], followed by a space and the
path and name

of the template file. From here on, your template files will be free from
unwanted intrusions.

17. Quick Text Selection in Windows

Generally, there's no faster way to select a block of text than by using
the mouse. Here's a trick that works in any Windows word processor (as
well as Word 5.5 for DOS): Click the left mouse button at the start of
the desired block, hold down <Shift>, and click the left button again
anywhere else in the document. This will highlight all text between the
first and second clicks, and you can do it moving up or down the file. To
extend the highlighted area further beyond the second click, hold down
<Shift> and

click again.

18. Use Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboards are for more than just typing. Even if you like to use the
mouse for moving text around, the fastest way to get work done is usually
by keyboard shortcuts. So take another look at your program's shortcut
commands, or dust off that keyboard template-you'll find it faster than
mousing around in menus.

19. Maximize Your Mail Merge

Most word processors let you break down mail-merge data in ways that make
this useful feature even more powerful. For example, splitting a name
field down into First Name, Middle Initial, and Last Name fields lets you
personalize your mailings by creating Ms. LastName or Dear FirstName
entries. Similarly, breaking a City, State, ZIP field down into separate
fields lets you send documents only to clients in a particular state or
ZIP code, or sort the records properly for bulk mail savings.

20. When in Doubt, Dial Up

When you can't seem to find an answer in the program's manual and
technical support lines are busy, there's one resource you can almost
always rely on: on-line forums. Services like America Online, CompuServe,
and GEnie are a terrific resource for valuable tips, top-notch technical
support, and a multitude of macros and utilities for your favorite
applications. Here's a breakdown on the major on- line services, with the
keywords you'll need to direct you to the proper forums:

WordPerfect 5.1 for Windows

27. A Familiar Feel for Windows

Making the jump from the DOS version of WordPerfect to the Windows
version isn't as easy as you might think. For one thing, all the keyboard
shortcuts that you have come to know have been changed. Press <F5> in the
DOS version and you get the file list; press <F5> in the Windows version
and you get the printing dialog box. Fortunately, you can go home to your
familiar DOS keystrokes, but only if you have the interim upgrade dated
April 30, 1992. (If you don't have this update, contact WordPerfect
Corporation.)

Select File*Preferences*Keyboard*Select, highlight WPDOS51.WWK in the
Files list, then choose Select and OK. You'll get most of your old
keystrokes back, along with familiar keyboard shortcuts displayed inside
your pull- down menus. You can then choose between the Windows or DOS
keystrokes for most of your formatting commands. -G. C.

28. Adding Special Characters

Unlike the DOS version, WordPerfect 5.1 for Windows doesn't let you use
the handy <Ctrl>-V or <Ctrl>-2 Compose command to insert special
characters. To use this function in Windows, move the cursor where you
want to insert the character, then select Font*WP Characters or press
<Ctrl>- W. A window will pop up, showing a chart of the characters.
Scroll down the list of character sets until you find the one you want.
To insert a character into your document, you can double-click the
character itself or select it and click Insert. You can then choose
additional characters to insert. If you want to add just one character
and return to your editing, select Insert and Close.

All these special WordPerfect characters will print using either
WordPerfect or Windows printer drivers. If the special character isn't
available in the current font, however, WordPerfect will print it as a
graphic; it may look slightly different from the font used for the rest
of the text. -G. C.

29. Customize Your Font List

Many Windows word processors give you a fast-access font button, but only
WordPerfect for Windows lets you customize the button's font list to show
only those fonts you use every day. Here's how to do it. Start by double-
clicking the Font button on the ruler. In the next dialog box, select
Assign to Ruler. In the Ruler Fonts Menu box, highlight each font you
want to add to your font menu, then double-click on it or select Add. If
you make a mistake, highlight the offending font in the Fonts on Ruler
list, then select Clear. When you're done adding the fonts you want,
select OK twice. Now, whenever you click the ruler's Font button, you can
drag down to the font you want and simply release the mouse button. -G.

30. Eyeing the Bottom Line

Unlike some programs, WordPerfect for Windows' mouse pointer does not
change shape when it passes over picture boxes, lines, and other objects.
Instead, you need to keep an eye on the status line at the bottom of the
editing screen.

A good example of this occurs when you've drawn a horizontal or vertical
line in your document with the Graphics*Line command. It's tough to tell
just when the pointer is in the right position to operate on the line.
But look at the status line, and you'll be able to see when you're
directly over the line. A left click will then select the line, while a
right click pops up the appropriate menu. -G. C.

31. Double-Click Button Bars

You may not know it, but WordPerfect for Windows' button bar has a dual
personality. Click once on the Font button, and you'll get your
customized list of fonts. Click twice, and you'll get the complete font
selection dialog box with all the fonts on your system-considerably
easier and faster than slogging through a series of pull-down menus.
Double clicking on the Size, Tab Set, Table, Styles, and other buttons
also puts you quickly inside the appropriate dialog boxes. -G. C.

32. Wholly Macros

Need a handy tool in WordPerfect for Windows? Don't waste your time
trying to reinvent the wheel. When you installed the program, WordPerfect
for Windows installed a number of powerful, undocumented macros that can
speed up your work. Here's a list of the more useful ones (the exact
macros you have depend on the release date of your copy):

Macro   Description
CAPITAL.WCM   Capitalizes first letter of current word
ENDFOOT.WCM   Converts endnotes to footnotes
FOOTEND.WCM   Converts footnotes to endnotes
ENVELOPE.WCM   Addresses envelope
LABELS.WCM   Adds predefined label formats to printer

page sizes

RECALC.WCM   Automatically recalculates all formulas

in a table

To have a look at these and other included macros, select
Macro*Play*View. Select one of the macros on the list, then read the
description comments in the View window.

To run the macro, select Play. The first time you run any macro,
WordPerfect compiles it, so it'll run rather slowly. From then on, you
get it at full speed. -G. C.

33. Customize Your Defaults

Open a WordPerfect for Windows document, and the program defaults to
12-point Courier font and 1-inch margins. But why be dull? You can
customize WordPerfect's default fonts, margins, and virtually any of its
other settings in flash. Just select File*Preferences*Initial Codes. The
program gives you a blank document where you can set defaults, and
displays the formatting codes you choose in a window. To change fonts,
select Font*Font, choose the font name and size you prefer, along with
any other formatting such as bold or italic, then select OK. To set new
margins, select Layout*Margins and enter new measurements. When you're
finished making changes, select Close to return to the editing screen.
From now on, your new settings will be the default. -G. C.

34. Turning the Tables

If you're using the April 30, 1992, interim release of WordPerfect for
Windows 5.1 (or version 5.2), you've got some new tools you may not be
aware of-like the ability to duplicate all or part of an existing table
inside the same document. With the new drag-and-drop features, it's easy.

Choose a document that already contains a table. Move the cursor inside
the table, hold down the left mouse button and the <Ctrl> key, and drag
the mouse to select the cells you want duplicated. You can choose a
single cell, a block, or the complete table. Release the mouse button and
<Ctrl> key, and position the mouse pointer anywhere inside the area you
just selected. Hold down the left button again, drag the pointer to the
location where you want to paste the table, and release the button.

35. Short-Order Menus

If you're like most users, you employ only a fraction of WordPerfect for
Windows' wealth of features. But whenever you drop down a menu, you see
what you don't use. Here's a trick that lets you switch back and forth
between WordPerfect for Windows' full and short menus in the same work
session.

First, make sure WordPerfect for Windows isn't running. Fire up Windows'
Notepad or your favorite text editor and load WPWP.INI, which you'll find
in your main Windows directory. Scroll to the section marked [Settings]
in the file and add the line EnableShortMenus=1 immediately following the
[Settings] line. You'll see another line in this section that reads,
ShortMenus=0. If you'd like the program to start up with abbreviated
menus, change the line to read ShortMenus=1. After you've made these
changes, save the file and exit Notepad.

Now, start WordPerfect for Windows and select View. In the menu that
drops down, you'll see a new entry, Short Menus. Select this command to
add or remove the checkmark beside it. If it's checked, you'll see just
the basic menus. If it's unchecked, you'll see the expanded, full menus.
You can toggle back and forth between the options at will.

Microsoft Word for Windows 2.0

36. Custom Toolbars

Why waste time hunting for macros in the Tools*Macro menu when you can
call them with a click of a button? WinWord makes it fairly easy to
decide which tools and commands you want to display as icons on its
customizable button bar. (Select View*Toolbar if the toolbar isn't
visible just below the menu bar.)

First, select Tools*Options, press T to get to the Toolbar Options dialog
box, and select Macros in the Show box. Scroll down the Macros list until
you highlight the one you want to turn into a button, then scroll the
list of buttons to select one you want to assign to the macro. The Tool
to Change list displays the names of all the buttons currently on the
toolbar, as well as the empty spaces between them. Scroll down the list
and select the button or space you want to replace, select Change, and
then Close. Your new macro button appears instantly in your toolbar.
Click once on the button to let it work its magic.

You can perform the same trick with commands, adding and deleting them
from the toolbar at will. Simply select Commands in the Show box and
follow the procedures outlined above. When you exit WinWord, be sure to
select Yes when prompted to save global changes. -Christina Wood

37. Jump-Starting WinWord

If you do the same thing each time you start Word for Windows-say, choose
the Find File or Open command from the File menu-you can save time by
having WinWord execute that first command for you. Just select your
WinWord icon in Program Manager and press <Alt>-<Enter> to open the
Properties dialog box. Position the cursor in the Command Line box after
WINWORD.EXE, type a space, and type /m followed by the startup command
you want, for example, /mFileOpen or /mFileFind. (You can use this /m
switch with any WordBasic command or macro name.) Then click OK. The next
time you double-click the Word for Windows icon, it will start WinWord
with the Open or Find File dialog box ready for you to use. But make sure
that the Command Line box includes the full path to your WinWord
directory, otherwise the tip may not work. -R. J. L.

38. Custom Menus

While toolbars may vary from template to template, menus are forever. You
can add an indispensible macro to one of WinWord's pull-down menus and
access it quickly no matter what template you're using at the time.
Here's how:

Select Tools*Options, press M to call up the Menus Options dialog box,
and select Macros in the Show box. Then select the name of the macro you
want to add and the menu you want to add it to. Select Add, then Close.
Remember: You need to accept all global changes at exit time, or you'll
have to do this procedure all over again. -G. C.

39. Drag Till You Drop

As just about everybody knows, Word for Windows 2.0 lets you select text
with the mouse, then drag it to a new location in your document. But did
you know that the same technique works for virtually every item in a
document, including tables, pictures, charts, and inserted OLE objects?
For most objects, the steps are the same as with text: Place the cursor
inside the object, hold down the left mouse button to select it, drag it
to a new locale, and release the button. With tables, it's a touch
trickier: You'll have to click and drag to select the entire table, then
release the mouse button. Move the pointer back into the selected area,
hold down the left button, then drag and release as usual.

Want to copy the item to a new location instead of moving it? Simply hold
down the <Ctrl> key before and while you release the mouse button. -C. G.

40. Fast Global Font Changes

You can change the font of an entire WinWord document with just a few
keystrokes. First, press <Ctrl>-5 (using the numeric keypad) to highlight
the entire document, then hit <Ctrl>-F and press <Down> (or the first
letter of the desired font's name) to scroll through the list of fonts.
Once you've selected a typeface, you can change its size by pressing <Tab
> and typing a new point size. When you're done, just press <Enter> and
return to your editing.

41. WinWord Marks the Spot

If you often work on long documents, you should be using WinWord's
Bookmark feature. By inserting named bookmarks, you'll make it easier to
jump to any section, chart, graphic, or other location you'll need to
find quickly when editing.

To insert a bookmark, place the cursor where you want the mark to be,
then select Insert*Bookmark to get the Bookmark dialog box (or press
<Ctrl>-<Shift>-<F5> for a simple prompt on the status bar at the bottom
of the screen). Type a brief name for the bookmark, then select OK (or
press <Enter>). Remember, though, if you select a block of text or an
object before inserting the bookmark, that text or object will be
highlighted again when you jump to that bookmark. If you delete or move
the highlighted items, the bookmark is similarly affected.

Now, any time you need to return to that point in your document, select
Edit*Go To (or hit <F5>), pick your bookmark from the list (or type the
bookmark's name), and select OK (or hit <Enter>). -G. C.

42. Need it Again? Spike It.

If you need to store one or more blocks of text or objects such as
graphics, tables, or charts in Word for Windows, use the Spike feature,
which stores the data temporarily for insertion later. Simply select the
text or object, then press <Ctrl>-<F3>. This cuts the data from the
document and loads it into the Spike buffer. Unlike Windows' Clipboard,
you won't lose your previous cuts when you add new ones-you can repeat
the process to store multiple objects in the Spike buffer. It's a great
way to gather up bits and pieces, then insert them elsewhere.

To copy contents of the Spike into your document, locate the cursor where
you want the item, then type spike and press <F3>. You can repeat this
command as many times as you like to paste the same data. If you want to
insert the Spike's contents just once, clearing it from the buffer at the
same time, press <Ctrl>-<Shift>-<F3> instead.

Best of all, you can store data from one WinWord document in the Spike
buffer and reinsert it in another WinWord document window you have open.
Exiting WinWord flushes the contents of the Spike. -G. C.

43. Counting Blocks

While WinWord gives you fast word and character counts for a whole
document, it won't let you measure individual sections of the file-a nice
tool to have when you're trying to make different parts of a long file
the same length. Fortunately, we've cooked up a macro that does the job
for you.

First, you'll need to fire up the WordBasic macro editor: In WinWord,
select Tools*Macro, type CountSelect, then select Edit. In the macro
editor, carefully type the lines in the listing below between the Sub
MAIN and End Sub entries.

EditCopy FileNew .NewTemplate = 0, .Template = "NORMAL" EditPaste Dim dlg
as DocumentStatistics GetCurValues dlg Dialog dlg Super
DocumentStatistics dlg Super EditUndo FileClose

Finish up and save your macro by selecting File*Save All, and then select
Yes in all the dialog boxes that pop up. Exit the macro editor by
selecting File*Close.

To use the macro, select the block of text you want to measure, then
select Tools*Macro. Choose the CountSelect macro, then select Run; or
double-click Count Select. You'll see the statistics for just the
selected block. Select OK to return to the document. If you find you use
this macro frequently, you can assign it to a keystroke combination or to
an icon on WinWord's toolbar.

44. Notes to Yourself

Word for Windows has the equivalent of Post-it notes, and they're easy to
use. Whenever you need to leave yourself or another user a note in a
document, select Insert*Annotation, type your note in the window at the
bottom of the screen, then select Close. There's just one
problem-WinWord's default settings don't let you see the marker for the
note because it's formatted as hidden text.

To view the markers in your document, and make that option the default,
select Tools*Options, press V to get to the View settings, then check the
Hidden Text box and select OK. For each note in the document, you'll see
an identifying marker that consists of your initials and a number inside
square brackets. Repeat the operation to uncheck the box when you want to
hide the note markers.

To view the note, double-click the marker, then select Close when you're
through. To remove a note permanently, simply select the marker with your
mouse or keyboard and press <Delete>. -G. C.

45. Word and Pictures

Do you need to insert a picture in a Word for Windows 2.0 document, then
position descriptive text nearby? An easy way to do this is to create a
table and insert the graphic into a cell, then add the text into
neighboring cells. To create a table, select Table*Insert Table. For best
results, you should specify an odd number of rows and columns, so you can
locate the picture in the center of the grid, and size the cell as
desired. Move the cursor into one of the cells, select Insert*Picture,
select a graphic, then select OK. The picture will appear in the cell. To
center the picture inside the cell, highlight it and click the centering
icon on the ribbon (select View*Ribbon if the ribbon isn't visible). Now
you can use the other cells of the table for your text. This is a great
technique for creating product descriptions in catalogs and flyers.

46. No More Disappearing Text

As in most Windows programs, when you select a block of text in Word for
Windows, anything you type replaces that text. This can be especially
annoying when you search for a text string: The text string remains
selected, then the next key you press overwrites it. Although you can get
the text back with a quick Edit*Undo command, you might want to disable
this overwrite feature. Making the change is easy. Select Tools*Options,
press G, then uncheck the Typing Replaces Selection box. Select OK to
finish the job and make your choice the new Word for Windows default.
From then on, if you type while text is selected, your new text will
appear to the left of the selected text, just as it does in Word 5.0.

47. WinWord's Go-Back Key

If you've selected text or an object in a Word for Windows document, then
used the scroll bars to look at something else at another location in the
document, WinWord offers a quick way to get back to where you were. Just
press <Shift>-<F5>.

But there's more to this magic keystroke. If you press<Shift>-<F5>
immediately after loading a document, the cursor will return to exactly
where it was when you saved the file. WinWord stores the last three
cursor positions as you work on a document. Repeated presses of <Shift>-
<F5> take you back one step at a time. -G. C.

48. Using Special Characters

Everyone needs to use a special character now and then, whether it's a
foreign currency mark or a star from a dingbat font. To access special
characters from Word for Windows, select Insert*Symbol. Scroll down the
list of symbol sets until you find the one that contains the character
you want, then look at the character grid. To insert the character,
double-click on it with the mouse or use the cursor keys to select it and
hit <Enter>. (If you have the Field Codes box checked in the
Tools*Options*View dialog box, you'll see the symbol's field marker.
Uncheck the box to see the symbol itself.) Once the character is in the
document, you can alter its size as you would any other character.

49. Instant E-Mail Formatting

Creating properly formatted ASCII files for uploading to electronic mail
systems or services like MCI Mail can be a chore. Unless you're extremely
meticulous, you're likely to get funky line breaks all over the place.
Here's a macro that does the job in a flash.

To create it, you'll have to crank up WinWord's WordBasic macro editor:
Select Tools*Macro, name the macro FormatEmail, then select Edit. In the
macro editor, carefully type the lines shown in the listing below between
Sub MAIN and End Sub.

When you're done, check your typing, select File Save All, and select Yes
at all the prompts that appear. Select File Close to get back to your
document.

To use the macro, start WinWord and type your E-mail message. When you're
ready to save it, select Tools Macros FormatEmail. Enter a file name when
prompted, complete with path information if necessary, then select OK.
The macro will reformat your text as 12-point Courier, with hard carriage
returns at the end of each 60-character line. It then saves the new file,
with the file name you specified, in ASCII format with carriage returns
at the ends of the formatted lines. You can then send that file as an
E-mail message using your communications or E-mail package. Then your
document will return to its original formatting, and you'll return to the
top of the document. -G. C.

EditSelectAll Prompt$ = "Enter a file name for your Email text file:"
Title$ = "Email File Name" Default$ = "" MyFile$ = InputBox$(Prompt$,
Title$, Default$) If MyFile$ = "" Then Goto Quit Font "Courier", 12
FileSaveAs .Name = MyFile$, .Format = 3 NormalStyle SendKeys "{left}"
Quit:

50. Smart Repeats

WinWord has an elephant's memory. In fact, WinWord will remember
everything you've typed, including backspaces, since the last time you
executed some other command.

If you press <F4> (or select Edit*Repeat Typing), the program will insert
all that text at the cursor position. You can type something once, then
move the cursor and press <F4> to insert the same text. (To make sure
there's no other text inside the buffer, issue any command, such as
FormatoCharacter, before typing the text.)

WinWord also remembers formatting commands, and can repeat them with <F4>
(or EditoRepeat Formatting). For example, if you need to reformat several
words or paragraphs in different locations, highlight the first word and
make the formatting changes using the Format menu. Then you can select
other text and press <F4> to duplicate the effect.

Finally, if you're not sure of the status of the repeat key at any time,
just pull down the Edit menu and take a look. The Repeat menu entry
always remembers the last thing you did. -G. C.

51. Dating WinWord Docs

Having WinWord insert the current date automatically every time you open
a document is a good way to track revisions, and it's easy to do. Select
InsertoField, then pick Date in the Insert Field Type list in the dialog
box. Choose a format from the Instructions list (the MMMM d, yyyy option
gives you a fully expanded date, as in January 25, 1993). Select OK to
insert the date field at the cursor. You can add boldface or other text
attributes to the date and set its alignment with normal commands. Each
time you load the document, the current date will display. -G. C.

52. Calling All Fonts

Did you ever wonder what all your fonts look like on paper? If you have
the Word for Windows 2.0a upgrade or a later one, you can find out.

When you installed WinWord, you also installed a document called PSS.DOC
on your hard disk. Load it into your word processor. A number of
self-installing macros are included in the document, including one called
PrinterTest that creates a document containing samples of every font you
have available, along with border and shading styles. Scroll down in the
PSS.DOC file until you find PrintTest's description, double-click its RUN
button, then select OK. (If you have the Field Codes box checked in the
Tools*Options*View dialog, the RUN button won't work.) The macro will
create the document, which you can then print out. If you have scores of
fonts, the process can take several minutes. Take a look at the other
macros in PSS.DOC as well-you're sure to find others you want to try.

53. Changes in Styles

Word for Windows includes a set of more than 20 preset styles for your
text in its NORMAL.DOT template. These include nine heading styles, eight
table of contents styles, plus footnote and annotation styles. But when
you use the Format*Style dialog, you normally see only a partial list.
While it's true that you may not need all these styles, wouldn't it be
nice to see them and decide for yourself? Here's how.

Select Format Style, then press <Ctrl>-Y. WinWord will add the hidden
styles to the drop-down list, making them instantly available. You'll
have to repeat this keystroke each time you use the dialog box and want
to see the complete style list.

Microsoft Word for DOS

54. Fast File Loads

Everyone sometimes needs to exit a word processor completely to do some
other work, then return to editing the same document. In any version of
Word for DOS, it's easy. Just start Word with the command WORD /L at the
DOS prompt. Word will automatically load the last document you worked on,
with the cursor right where you left it.

55. Making Word 5.5 More Familiar

If you've switched to Word 5.5 but miss the function keys you're used to
from earlier versions of Word, you don't have to learn an entirely new
system. You can go back. Select Utilities*Customize, then check the Use
Word 5.0 Function Keys option. If you're used to the way the <Insert> key
worked in earlier versions, check the UsIns for Overtype Key option as
well. Select OK to finish up and store these settings as the defaults.

56. One-Word Spelling Check

You don't always want to check the spelling of an entire document. In
Word 5.x, you can easily check the spelling of just part of a document.
Highlight the text to be checked, then give the check spelling command (
<Alt>-<F6> in version 5.0 or <F7> in version 5.5). Word will check only
the highlighted text, letting you get back to work more quickly.

57. Instant Text Moves

If you need to move a block of text in Word 5.x, here's a trick for mouse
users. Start by highlighting the text you want to move, using the mouse
or Word's keyboard shortcuts. Now, move the mouse pointer where you want
the text to go, hold down the <Ctrl> key, and click the right mouse
button. Your text, still highlighted, will move instantly to the new
location.

58. The Big Picture

If you'd like to see more of your document in Word 5.0, and you're using
an EGA, VGA, or Hercules-compatible monochrome system, you can see up to
60 lines of text on your screen. The result may not be pretty, but you'll
be able to see an entire page of text at once without scrolling. First,
press <Esc>O, tab to the Display mode field and press <F1>. You'll see a
menu of the text and graphics options for your display type. Select the
one you want and press <Enter> to make it the default.

You'll find the same options in version 5.5. Select View*Preferences,
then choose a Display Mode from the list and select OK. Here's the best
part: In both versions, Word remembers the previous display option as
well. To switch back and forth between them, press <Alt>-<F9>.

59. Quick Bordered Text

Need a border or lines around some text in Word for DOS? It's easy. Start
by positioning your cursor inside the paragraph to be boxed. Then, in
Word 5.0, press <Esc>FB. Select the options you want from the fields in
the menu, then press <Enter> to create the box. In Word 5.5 the process
is slightly different: Select Format*Borders, make your selections in the
dialog box, then select OK to finish the job. (If you want a single box
around multiple paragraphs, press <Shift>-<Enter> instead of <Enter>
between paragraphs.)

60. Word's Glossary Memories

How many times have you typed your name and address into a letter or
other document? Don't waste your time. With Word 5.x you can store those
phrases, as well as entire blocks of frequently used text, as Glossary
entries with all their formatting intact. Here's how.

In Word 5.0, start by typing and selecting a block of text you want to
store. Now, press <Esc>C. Type in an abbreviation for the text-one you'll
remember easily-such as Myname or ReturnAddress. Use any abbreviation you
like, but without spaces or punctuation. Press <Enter> to store the
abbreviation and text. Repeat this as often as you like, adding Glossary
entries in any Word session. To save the entries, press <Esc>TGS<Enter>.

To store a glossary entry in Word 5.5, select the text, then select
Edit*Glossary. Type in a glossary abbreviation or name, then select
Define. To save your glossary entries, select Edit*Glossary*Save.

Now, whenever you need one of these entries in either Word version, just
type the abbreviation and press <F3>. Word will insert the whole entry at
the cursor position. If you can't remember the abbreviation for a
glossary entry, press <Esc>I<F1> in version 5.0, or select Edit*Glossary
in version 5.5, then pick the glossary entry you need from the list.

61. Fast Moves With Bookmarks

If you work on long documents, don't neglect Word 5.0's speedy bookmarks.
By placing a bookmark at spots in your document you need to find
frequently, you'll be able to speed up your editing dramatically. To
insert a bookmark at the current cursor position or on selected text,
press <Esc>FK, type an easy to remember name for the mark (no spaces),
then press <Enter>. When you need to jump to that spot from anywhere in
the document, press <Esc>JK, type the bookmark's name or press <F1> to
pick it from a list, then press <Enter>. If you highlighted a block of
text when you created the bookmark, that text will be selected after the
jump.

62. Back to the Beginning (or End)

When you've selected a large block of text in Word 5.x or earlier
versions, the beginning or end of the block may be off the screen. Once
you perform formatting or another operation on the block, you'll want to
get back to the start or end of the block quickly. It's easy. Press <Left
><Right and you'll find yourself back where you started, with the
previously selected text deselected. To move just past the end of the
block, press <Right> instead.

63. Fast Mouse Selections

Word 5.x offers a quick way for mouse users to select either whole lines
or entire paragraphs of text. To make this work, position the mouse
cursor in the blank area to the left of the text to be selected. To
select a line of text, click the left button. A right click selects the
entire paragraph.

Ami Pro 2.0 and 3.0

64. What's My Icon?

Ami Pro's SmartIcons icon bar can really speed up your work, but it can
be tough to remember what a particular icon does. In versions 2.0 and
3.0, your right mouse button is the key to end the confusion. Just click
and hold the right button on any icon to see a description of each tool
in the Title Bar.

65. Reverse Type

Using white text on a dark background (known as reverse type) is an easy
way to make your documents stand out. While Ami Pro won't let you format
normal text this way, you can still create this effect in version 2.0 or
3.0. Start by creating a frame for the text by selecting Frame and
specifying the frame's size and position. Double-click in the frame, type
your text, and then select it. Format the text using the Text*Font
command, selecting the font and attributes you want, then click on the
white square inside the Font dialog box's color selection bar, and press
OK. The text will seem to have disappeared, but don't worry, it's still
there.

Now select Frame*Modify Frame Layout. Inside the dialog box select Lines
& shadows in the Frame area. Click on the black square on the Background
color selection bar, then click OK. Voil*! You now have white text
against a black background.

To choose another color for the background, display the expanded color
selection chart by clicking the arrow in the Background section, then
select the shade you want. Your text will appear and print as white
letters on your selected background shade. But remember, reverse type is
best used sparingly, for headlines, section titles, and other
attention-getting text.

66. Ami Pro's Secret Macros

Ami Pro ships with a healthy collection of helpful macros, but you may
not read about them in the manuals. To get the scoop about Ami Pro's
undocumented macros, you'll need to start Ami Pro and open GOODIES-.SAM,
which you should find in your Ami Pro default document directory. Here
you'll get an annotated list of some of Ami Pro's more interesting
macro-based features. While both version 2.0 and 3.0 sport a good-size
set of fancy macros, 3.0's are especially hot, with new tools for
modifying menus, batch printing and file conversion utilities, an area
code finder-even a game that runs in the Ami Pro window. To help you add
any or all of these macros to your Ami Pro 3.0 menus, select
Tools*Macros*Playback, pick SPECIALF.SMM, and select OK, then follow the
instructions on the screen. Version 2.0 users will have to add their
goodies to menus manually. Don't miss these valuable tools.

67. True Typographical Characters

You can't type typographically correct opening and closing double or
single quotation marks, apostrophes, or dashes in Ami Pro 2.0 or
3.0-they're simply not on the keyboard. While you can hold down <Alt> and
type the ANSI codes for these characters on the numeric keypad, Ami Pro
offers a better solution in its SMARTYPE.SMM macro, installed with the
program.

First, create your document the normal way, typing keyboard quotation and
apostrophe characters. Where you want a dash, type two hyphens. Then, if
you're using version 2.0, select Tools*Macros*Playback, select
SMARTTYPE.SMM from the list of macros, then select OK. Ami Pro will go
through the document, changing quotation marks, apostrophes, single
quotation marks, and your double hyphens into the typographical
equivalents.

It's even easier with version 3.0. Click on the SmartIcon selector icon
at the bottom right of your screen, then choose the Macro Goodies option.
The SmartType icon looks like an opening quotation mark and will run the
macro automatically. Version 2.0 users can add this macro to their icon
bar manually in the Tools*SmartIcons*Customize dialog box.

68. Mix and Match SmartIcons

Ami Pro 3.0 ships with eight complete sets of SmartIcons. Each set is
designed to complement different tasks, such as editing, proofing, and
working with graphics. To switch between them, click on the SmartIcon
icon on the right side of the status bar at the bottom of the Ami Pro
screen, then pick the set you want to use.

69. Smarter-Looking Icons

You don't like the look of an Ami Pro 3.0 SmartIcon? Change it by
selecting Tools*SmartIcons. Select Edit Icon, then in the next dialog,
select the icon to edit and, choosing colors from the color bar, draw
with your mouse to alter the icon. When you're done, select OK to finish
the change.

If you use a VGA or super-VGA monitor, there's an easy way to display
more SmartIcons on your Ami Pro 3.0 screen: Make them smaller. To do
this, select Tools*SmartIcons, select the Icon Size button, then select
the Small (EGA) option and click OK. From then on, you'll see more of the
Smart-Icons at once, in a smaller size.

70. Fast E-Mail Formatting

You can format documents for electronic mail using Ami Pro 2.0 or 3.0,
but it takes a macro to do the job quickly. To create the macro, fire up
Ami Pro and start with a blank screen. Then type the macro language code
shown in the listing at right.

When you're finished, check your typing, then select File*Save As. In the
file type list, choose Ami Pro Macro. Type MAKEMAIL in the Filename
field, then select OK and close the macro file. (If this tip leaves your
E-mail in Times New Roman or a font other than Courier and you use
Windows 3.1, substitute "Courier New" for "Courier" in the macro.)

To use the macro, create your document as usual, then select
Tools*Macros*Playback, pick MAKEMAIL.SMM from the list, then select OK.
Type a path and file name for your E-mail file at the prompt, and select
OK when you see the ASCII Options dialog box. You can then upload the
newly saved ASCII file with your communications or E-mail program. The
lines will be the correct length for any E- mail system. If you'll use
this macro often, save time by assigning it a shortcut key or adding it
to the SmartIcon bar.

FUNCTION main() Prompt$ = "Enter the path and file name for your Email
fil e." NoName$ = "" MyFile$ = Query$(Prompt$, NoName$) IF MyFile$ = ""

        GOTO Quit

ENDIF TYPE ("[CtrlHome]") TYPE ("[ShiftCtrlEnd]") FontFaceChange
("Courier") FontPointSizeChange (12)
ImportExport(1,MyFile$,"ASCII",0,"LINE",ASCII,0) FontRevert() TYPE ("
[CtrlHome]") Quit: END FUNCTION

71. Selecting an Entire Document

Ami Pro versions 2.0 and 3.0 lack a command to select the entire
document. You can work around this missing feature by pressing <Ctrl>-
<Home><Ctrl>-<Shift>-<End>. If you use this command frequently, it's
worth recording as a macro.

72. Multiple Frames in Ami Pro

If you use Ami Pro to create product catalogs, design business cards, or
even just print mailing labels, you'll need to create the same frames
over and over on the page. But why design each new frame from scratch?
With Ami you can create one and insert as many copies of it as you need.
Use the Frame command to create a new frame, then fill it with your text.
Click once on the frame to select it, then copy it to the Clipboard using
a SmartIcon or Edit*Copy. (If you've nested other frames inside the frame
to be moved, you'll need to hold down <Shift> and click on all the frames
before copying them to the Clipboard.) Move the cursor to where you want
to insert a copy of the frame and select Edit*Paste (or press <Shift>-
<Insert>). You can then hold down <Shift> while you drag the frame to any
location on the page. The original will stay just where it was.

WordStar for DOS and Windows

73. Partial Spelling Checks in WordStar 6.0 and 7.0

WordStar normally runs its spelling check from the beginning of the
document. Often, though, you want to check spelling only from the current
cursor position. Select Utilities*Spelling Other*Spell Rest or use the
classic command <Ctrl>-QL.

74. Multiple Docs in WordStar for Windows

Unlike most Windows word processors, Wordstar for Windows won't let you
open multiple documents simultaneously. However, you can run more than
one copy of the program to edit additional documents. On a typical
Windows 3.1 system with 4MB of RAM, you should be able to run three
copies simultaneously, depending on how large the documents are. You can
still cut and paste between documents via the Windows Clipboard. If you
try this trick, though, be sure to close all other applications and save
your work frequently to avoid problems.

75. The Right Way to Align Text

If you've ever tried to get WordStar 6.0 to right-justify a header, you
know it just about takes an act of Congress. The easiest way is, first
type in the line you want right- justified without any dot commands. Then
type <Ctrl>-O] to justify the text. Then put the dot command .HEO at the
start of the line. You can do the same thing with footers using the .FO
dot command.

Title:     Microsoft Word.
             (includes related article on customizing Microsoft Word for
             Windows's startup) (201 Hot Windows Secrets)


Abstract:  Tips on how to better use Microsoft Corp's Word for Windows
           word processing package are offered. The tips range from how
           to expedite copy formatting to tuning the zoom controls. Word
           users can align document text such as letterheads, headers and
           footers. Users can copy character formatting quickly by
           highlighting the text needed to be changed, holding down the
           control-shift key, and then clicking the left mouse button on
           any area of text with the formatting that needs to be copied.
           Additional tips on Word for Windows are discussed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full Text:

Text Alignment as You Like It

Letterheads, headers, and footers often call for left-aligned,
right-aligned, and centered text on the same line. Word's regular text
formatting can't manage this, but the Table feature can. To mix all three
alignments on a line, place the insertion point where you want the line
to appear, and choose Table, Insert Table. Specify three columns and one
row for your table, and click on OK. Select the entire table, choose
Format, Paragraph, and make sure that Indentation is set to zero on the
left and the right. Then type text in each of the cells, and use the
paragraph-justification buttons on your toolbar to select left
justification for the leftmost cell, centered justification for the
middle one, and right justification on the right.

Copy Formatting Fast

To copy character formatting quickly, highlight the text you want to
change, hold down Ctrl-Shift, and click with the left mouse button on any
area of text with the formatting you want to copy. Copy paragraph
formatting the same way, but click in the selection bar to the left of
the paragraph whose formatting you want to copy. Note: This feature may
work erratically with Word 2.0 releases prior to August 31, 1992.

Banish White Space with Text Wrap

Use a frame to make text flow around a graphical object such as an
inserted chart or a PCX file. First, position the cursor on a blank line
(a line containing only a carriage return), and select Insert, Picture.
Select the graphics file you want to insert and click on OK. The picture
appears on a line by itself.

Select the image by clicking on its center. Select Insert, Frame to put a
frame around the graphic. (If you're not already in Page Layout view,
answer Yes when Word asks you if you want to switch.) If there's room
between the margins, the text wraps around a frame, select the frame and
choose Format, Frame, Text Wrapping: None to place the graphic on its own
line.

Run Macros Faster from Buttons

To create a button in your document that will run any Word macro, choose
Insert, Field, and select Macro Button. Type the name of a macro
immediately following the term macrobutton in the Field Code: box, then
type the text identifying the button. Click on OK to return to your
document. To edit the macro button, ensure that field codes are turned on
(choose View, Field Codes). To run the macro, turn off the field codes
display so that only the button text is visible, and double-click on this
text. You can also insert Microsoft Draw objects or other graphical
objects in place of the button text.

Make Word Fill the Screen

There's an easy way to eliminate Word's annoying tendency to open with a
different window size every time it starts up. Create a macro that
maximizes Word, and call it AUTOEXEC to have Word run the macro whenever
it starts. Select Tools, Macro, and type AUTOEXEC in the Macro Name: box.
Then click on Edit. Type in the following line between the lines Sub Main
and End Sub:

If AppMaximize() = 0 Then AppMaximize

Save your changes and exit. When you restart WinWord, this macro checks
to see if Word's application window is maximized. If it's not, the macro
maximizes it for you. You can also put any other commands in the AUTOEXEC
macro that you want to run whenever you start Word.

KILLER TIP

CUSTOMIZE WORD STARTUP

Make Word open the last document you worked on as soon as it starts.
Select the Word icon in Program Manager, press Alt-Enter, then place the
cursor at the end of the text in the Command Line: box. Add a space, then
type/MFile1 at the end of this line.

Or, to start a new document based on the automated letter template
LETBLOCK, create the following macro, named NEWLETTER.

Sub Main

FileNew .NewTemplate = 0, .Template = "LETBLOCK"

End Sub

Then use the command line C: [unkeyable]WORD20[unkeyable]WINWORD.EXE
/MNewLetter to start WinWord and begin a new letter. You may want to
create several macros--one for each of your document templates--and then
create a separate Program Manager icon that runs each. In Program
Manager, choose File, New, and select Program Item. Then specify the Word
command line, complete with a /M switch and macro name, and give the icon
a title that identifies the template with which it opens. Note: Word
won't run the AUTOEXEC macro when you specify a macro on the command
line.

Get Rid of Document1

To start Word without the usual blank document, select the Word icon in
Program Manager and press Alt-Enter to bring up the Program Item
Properties dialog box. The Command Line: box contains the path and
filename of WinWord. Add a /N (slash N) to the end of this command line.
The line should now look something like this:

C: [unkeyable]WORD20[unkeyable]WINWORD.EXE /N

Click on OK. When you start WinWord, you'll get a blank screen.

Fine-Tune Your Zoom Controls

To move quickly between views, use the ViewZoom command on your toolbar.
Select Tools, Options, and select the Toolbar set of options. Select a
button you don't use from the Tool to Change: box. Pick a new button face
(such as the binoculars icon), then select Commands in the Show: box.
Scroll through the list of commands and select ViewZoom, then click on
OK.

When you click on the ViewZoom button, a large arrow drops down from the
button. Hold down the mouse button, and scroll up and down this arrow to
set the degree of magnification you want. When you release the mouse
button, your document is zoomed to that degree.

Title:     Windows imports key to this Mac offering.
             (Microsoft Corp.'s Word for Macintosh 5.1 word processing
             software)
Author:    Blackwell, Gerry


Abstract:  Microsoft Corp's Word for the Macintosh 5.1 word processing
           software imports new features from the Windows version. Among
           these features are the embedded object concept that allows
           inserting charts and graphs, tool bars, a button that makes
           using the program easier, and the Create Envelope function for
           generating a ready-to-print envelope file. When using Create
           Envelope, Mac Word 5.1 is able to provide the ability for
           storing and retrieving often-used addresses, a feature that is
           not available in the Windows version. Another new feature that
           is pure Mac is the text annotation facility that allows the
           insert of an annotation anywhere in the document. With Mac
           Word 5.1 too, a user can 'drop cap' letters, words or portions
           of text with just a few keystrokes. A minor flaw is that when
           the annotation box is open on the screen, the user cannot work
           on the main document.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full Text:

 Here's a switch: Macintosh aping Windows. The new version of Microsoft
Word for Macintosh, 5.1, includes a bunch of nifty new features, of which
the most visible are imports from the Windows version of the product.

 Expect to see more 'cultural' borrowings of this kind as Mac-Windows
cross-platform applications begin to proliferate. Witness the recent dual
introduction of Claris FileMaker Pro for Mac and Windows.

 The button bar introduced with Mac Word 5.1 is a major ease-of-use
enhancement. As with the WinWord implementation, it comes already
configured with default buttons for commonly-used functions - 15 or 26 in
the Mac environment, depending on your screen size. But you can easily
customize the bar, replacing default buttons with others to activate any
command available.

 Unlike the Windows version you can have the button bar show up
horizontally just below the menu bar, the default position, or vertically
on the edge of the document window, left or right. Of course, if you put
it along the side, you can't display as many buttons. Mac Word 5.1 also
includes a bigger library of button icons than WinWord for use when
customizing the bar.

 Microsoft has borrowed the Windows embedded object concept again to
provide a facility for inserting graphs and charts created with a
Windows-like applet shipped with the product.

 It joins the drawing tool, added in an earlier version. A button for the
graphing tool appears along with drawing and table-making tool buttons on
the ribbon in the document window. In the Windows version, these buttons
all take up valuable real estate on the button bar.

 The current mania for button and tool bars in Windows applications seems
a logical extension to the interface Windows originally borrowed from the
Mac. So it's surprising this feature is only now being added to Mac Word.

 The Create Envelop feature is another useful little work saver brought
over from WinWord. By highlighting an address in a Word document, then
selecting the Create Envelop command from the Tools menu (or clicking on
the button on the button bar), you can quickly generate a ready-to-print
envelope file without going to the bother of setting up the printer and
keying in the addresses.

 Again, Mac Word goes one better than WinWord. It provides a facility for
storing often-used addresses and retrieving them when using Create
Envelopes.

 The other major new features in 5.1 are pure Mac - so far. The text
annotation facility could be a real boon for companies that pass Word
files around a lot on disk or on a network. You can insert an annotation
anywhere in the document by selecting Annotation from the Insert menu.
Key in a note in the dialogue box that pops up, mark it with your
initials and click to insert the annotation.

 A graphic, not the annotation itself, appears in the document. The
graphic is unfortunately too big to fit in a regular line space, though,
so it tends to break up the text. Double click on the graphic and the
annotation box opens up revealing the text.

 One small flaw: you can't work on the main document while the annotation
box is open on the screen. Too bad.

 It would be useful sometimes to be able to refer to the annotation while
making changes to the document - when making requested revisions to the
document, for example.

 Mac Word already had a voice annotation function that works much the
same as text annotation. It's odd that voice should have come first. Text
annotation is so much simpler and seemingly obvious an idea.

 If you use Word for preparing newsletters and you've often wondered how
to create a drop cap effect, with the first letter in a story enlarged
and the rest of the text running around it, wonder no more. With 5.1, you
can do it with a few keystrokes. You can 'drop cap' the first letter
only, the first word or a selected portion of text. And you can put the
drop cap in the margin or embed it in the text.

 Again, it seems so simple, you wonder why Microsoft didn't do it long
ago. It would be a nice feature to have in Word for Windows too. Are you
listening Bill?

Title:     Word processing.
             (question-and-answer) (Here's How)(resolving problems in the
             use of WordPerfect 5.1, Word for Windows 2.0 and Ami
             Professional 2.0 word processing software packages)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full Text:

Q I use WordPerfect 5.1 and like to store my documents in a directory
other than the one used by the program files. When I want to retrieve a
file, I use the <F5> (List Documents) command, but I'm tired of having to
type the new directory name to see my documents. How can I avoid this?

A WordPerfect is way ahead of you. To change the default directory for
your current session, press <F5>. When asked for a directory, press =,
type the directory path, and press <Enter>. The equal sign tells
WordPerfect to make the new directory the current default.

Of course, that default is changed when you exit WordPerfect. To
permanently change the default directory, press <Shift>-<F1>LD, type the
directory information, then press <Enter> three times. This won't affect
your current session, but the next time you load WordPerfect, that
directory will be your default, and pressing <F5><Enter> will bring you
to a list of its files.

Q I have a problem with sorting in WordPerfect 5.1. My document is a list
of titles, one per line. While WordPerfect sorts the first word of each
line correctly, the rest of the line isn't sorted. For example, In a
Mist, In Odessa, and In the Gloaming end up out of order. How can I get
an accurate sort?

A I can help sort out your problem. Since your document is a simple list
of titles, you can use WordPerfect's search-and- replace feature to
replace the spaces between words with "hard spaces," which WordPerfect
will ignore when sorting-in effect, seeing each title as a single word.

With your document loaded, press <Home><Home><Cursor Up> to make sure
you're at the top. To replace ordinary spaces with hard spaces, press
<Alt>-<F2>N<Space><F2><Home><Space><F2>. Press <Home><Home><Cursor Up>
again to return to the top of the document. If you press <Alt>-<F3>,
you'll see a hard space symbol ([ ]) between words.

Now for the sort: With the cursor still at the top of the page, press
<Ctrl>-<F9>S<Enter><Enter>P. Your list will be sorted perfectly. There's
no need to go back to the regular space characters if you won't be
justifying the titles.

Q I'm a screenwriter and need a word processing program that can produce
the exacting formatting required for screenplays and scripts. Is there
anything that will do this tough job?

A You're right, multiple columns and precise pagination requirements make
formatting a screenplay difficult. There is, however, an add-on program
for WordPerfect 5.1 designed just for the job. SuperScript Pro from ITE
Technologies works with WordPerfect by presetting the correct layouts for
feature films, TV situation comedies, TV dramas, and stage plays. You use
<Ctrl>-key combinations to handle formatting and other chores. Other
features let you insert scenes, change character names globally, and
more, allowing you to concentrate on the art of screenwriting rather than
the mechanics. The program sells for $159. Contact ITE Technologies,
310/559-3814.

Q I often need to edit other workers' Word for Windows 2.0 documents.
When I open one, I get the other person's WinWord font and formatting
preferences, but I'd rather see my own. I can redefine the styles, but
that's time-consuming. Is there a shortcut?

A This can be an annoying problem, particularly if the original author
used some bizarre font for the text. However, the solution is simple.
Instead of selecting File*Open to retrieve a document, start with a blank
document, then select Insert*File. Choose a document file, then select
OK. Any text that uses an unaltered style will use the style having the
same name in your default template. You'll get not only your preferred
fonts, but also your margin settings and other style-based formatting
attributes.

This won't work if your co-worker, in preparing the document, selected
text and chose a specific font or applied some other attribute. In that
case, you'll see that text in the fonts and attributes used by the
original author.

Q I'm writing a macro in Word for Windows 2.0 but have come up against a
stone wall. The macro must display the program's table creation dialog
box, let the user enter the desired number of rows and columns, then
insert the table in the document. I've tried everything I can think of,
but nothing seems to work. Everything else in my macro works fine. Do you
have a solution?

A The answer to this one is not obvious, and the Using WordBasic manual
and WinWord's macro help screens aren't clear. In your macro, wherever
you want to call the Insert Table dialog box, insert these four lines:

Dim MyDialog1 as TableInsertTable

GetCurValues MyDialog1

Dialog MyDialog1

TableInsertTable MyDialog1

Here's how it works: The first line defines the standard TableInsertTable
dialog box as the one you want to show. The next line tells WordBasic to
get the values when the user enters them. The third line actually
displays the dialog box, while the fourth line uses the values the user
enters to actually create the table. You can use the same structure to
display any WinWord dialog box for user input, using any name you like to
replace 'MyDialog1'.

Q I use Word for Windows 2.0 often and would like to be able to preview
and delete files in the program without switching to File Manager. Can
WinWord handle this chore for me?

A In November 1992's Dialog Box column, we offered a simple macro for
quickly deleting files from within Word for Windows. For loading,
previewing, copying, and deleting files, however, you'd do best using
WinWord 2.0's capable file management system, which many users don't know
about. Here's how to proceed:

Select File*Find File. If the file you want is in your current directory
and is a WinWord document, you'll see it in the list box. Click on a file
name to bring up a preview of the document in miniature, and select
Delete to delete the file. You won't be able to delete any files
currently loaded into WinWord, however. To select more than one file for
deletion, hold down the <Ctrl> key while you click on the file names.

If the file or files you want to preview or delete aren't in your current
directory, you'll have to go a bit further. As before, select File*Find
File, then select Search. In the next dialog box, Search, click the Edit
Path button. In the Edit Path dialog box, navigate the tree in the
Directories box-changing drives in the Drive box if necessary-to
highlight the directory you want to search, then click Add. You can add
more directories to the Search Path box if you want. Click Close or press
<Esc>. Back in the Search dialog box, select Start Search. When WinWord
finishes the search, you'll return to the previous dialog box, where you
can delete any files in the list.

Q I like the table feature in Ami Professional 2.0, but the tables must
be centered or aligned with the left margin. I need to position a table
in another location. Can Ami Pro do this?

A No problem. The trick here-and it's not obvious until you try it-is to
put your table in a frame, rather than on the base page itself. Start by
selecting Frame* Create Frame*Manual. With the mouse, move the frame
cursor to the upper left corner of the position for your table, then hold
down the left button while you drag the frame to the size you want. Next,
release the mouse button, and select Tools*Tables, set the number of
columns and rows you want, and select OK.

Now, with the empty table inside the frame, you can use Ami Pro's Table
commands to fill in the table. If you want to edit the table later, all
you have to do is double-click inside the frame. As with all Ami Pro
frames, you can position or resize your table frame at any time.
