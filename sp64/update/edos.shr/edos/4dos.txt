
EDOS users using 4DOS:

You must be using 4DOS version 4.xx or later. NDOS which was distributed
with Norton Utilites is equivalent to 4DOS version 3.xx, and WILL NOT
work correctly with EDOS.


4DOS works ok with EDOS except in regards to the following:

1. The 50K Windowed DOS session ICON that EDOS setup installs must be 
modified. If you attempt to run it unmodified you will receive a warning
message that the pif file must be changed. Use the PIF editor and change
the memory required and limits to 128K, or larger if necessary.

2. Certain EDOS commands are longer than 8 characters. Like: exclusive,
clipboard, etc. These long commands will generate an error message.
There are 2 different solutions. The simplest is to type only the
first 8 characters of the EDOS command. Like exclusive, would be exclusiv.
The other method is to create an alias. Consult your 4DOS documentation
on constructing an alias. Make the longer version of the command equal to
the shorter version. THIS IS FIXED in EDOS v 3.50F.


3. Alt-F4 for exiting does not work correctly if you have 4DOS version
4.0. You need the update to 4.01. If not then you should disable the
alt-f4 feature in EDOS. Use the EDOSAltF4=0 switch in system.ini.

4. If 4DOS is using a disk file for swapping; if you close the session
using the Alt-F4 hot key, the disk file may NOT be deleted properly.
Use the EXIT command or switch to memory swapping, EMS or XMS.
When the session exits, EMS and XMS memory are freed, even if you don't
use the EXIT command. See also, the 4DOS documentation, Swapping and
Multitasking software.




Version 3.50a of EDOS fixed certain problems associated with using EDOS.
Including the Alt-F4 feature, and the tendency of certain commands
modified by EDOS (MEM, HELP, etc), to not work consistently.
This is fixed.


4DOS version 4.02A was slightly broken, when used with edos. Fixed
in 4.02B.
