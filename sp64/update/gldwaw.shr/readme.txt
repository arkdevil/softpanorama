From the creator of ScopeTrax comes a new, powerful
sound processing application for Microsoft Windows.

This application combines the standard Windows graphical
interface and large memory management with the sound editing
features of the original ScopeTrax.

GoldWave is packed with features:
  * Supports all MPC sound cards (SB, SB16, PAS16, GUS, ...)
  * Full 16-bit stereo editing
  * Multiple re-sizable file windows with time axis and
     "Overview" box.
  * Independent left/right channel editing and viewing
  * Super zoom to magnify to a sub-sample level for extra
     accurate editing
  * Detached "Scope and Controls" window with an oscilloscope
     and play, pause, stop, record, volume, balance, and speed
     controls
  * Intelligent editing that automatically converts
     sampling rates, bits, and channels when copying and
     pasting to different file formats
  * Built-in support for WAV, VOC, IFF, AU, SND as well
     as the ability to open RAW files
  * Tool Bar for editing, zooming, and opening files
  * Standard effects: echo, volume, reverse, ...
  * Flexibility to choose input/output devices
  * NEW! Expression evaluator for any type of sound generation
     and manipulation (in time domain)
  * Shareware, with NO FEATURES DISABLED !

Additional Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------

1) If you want to open large ".au" (micro-Law encoded) files,
makes sure you keep Options | Settings "Load uLaw as 8-bits"
checked.  Otherwise, twice as much memory is required (but
it gives better quality).  I have opened files over 250
seconds in length without any problems.

2) The largest file you can open depends upon how much RAM
you have for Windows.  If you plan to use 16-bit, stereo,
44100Hz CD quality, then you need 10 megabytes of RAM for
every minute of sound.  A 5 minute song requires 50 Megs.
The amount of virtual memory you have makes no difference.
