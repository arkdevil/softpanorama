SuperVGA 32768 BGI driver 
Version 1.1
June 12, 1992

This is the newest version of my SuperVGA 32768 BGI driver.  All functions
have been implemented, but there may still be bugs.

Note:  Palette functions, and the mouse cursor will not work with this driver.

  Using the HiColor driver:

	Implementing the 32768 color driver involved several hacks, as
	the BGI interface only supports 8-bit color values, but the driver
	needed support for 15-bit color values.  The procedures that needed
	to be changed were those that accepted color values, (SetColor,
	SetFillStyle, SetFillPattern, PutPixel and Floodfill)  and those 
	that return color values (GetColor and GetPixel).
	As the HiColor modes do not support palettes, I decided to use
	the SetRgbPalette call to set colors, as it accepts values for the 
	R,G and B components of the color.

	The format of a pixel in the HiColor modes is:
		-Byte 1- -Byte 0-
		xRRRRRGG GGGBBBBB

	Several new functions are defined to make the color selection easier.
	In addition, the macro RGB(rv,gv,bv) has been defined.  It packs
	the R, G and B values into the format described above and returns the
	combined color.

	* RealDrawColor(); - Sets the current drawing color.
	  Usage:
	    setcolor(RealDrawColor(RGB(rval,gval,bval)); - HiColor modes
	    setcolor(RealDrawColor(cval)); - (suggested for any other driver)

	* RealFillColor(); - Sets the current fill color.
	  Usage:
	    setfillstyle(fillstyle,RealFillColor(RGB(rval,gval,bval)));
	    setfillstyle(fillstyle,RealFillColor(cval));
	    setfillpattern(fillpat,RealFillColor(RGB(rval,gval,bval)));
	    setfillpattern(fillpat,RealFillColor(cval));

	* RealColor(); - For putpixel, sets the color of the pixel
		       - For floodfill, sets the color of the boundary
	    putpixel(x,y,RealColor(RGB(rval,gval,bval)));
	    putpixel(x,y,RealColor(cval));
	    floodfill(x,y,RealColor(RGB(rval,gval,bval)));
	    floodfill(x,y,RealColor(cval));

	* GetPixel normally only returns an 8-bit value.  However, the
	  value returned from the BGI driver is a 16-bit value in DX (the 
	  BGI kernel loads the value into AX and clears the upper 8 bits),
	  so to read the value of a pixel:

	  In Pascal:
	    Color := getpixel(x,y);
	    inline($89/$56/<Color);  (* Loads 15-bit color value *)

	  In C:
	    Color = getpixel(x,y);
	    Color = _DX;
	  

	* Support for the ATI XL card has been added (1.1) 
	    ATI only supports 640x480x32k

	* Paging has been added (1.1)

	  Mode		Paging?		# of pages (with 1024k)
	  320x200	yes		8
	  640x350	yes		2
	  640x400	yes		2
	  640x480	no		1
	  800x600	no		1
