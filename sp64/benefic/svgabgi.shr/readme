Here it is! The SuperVGA/Tweak BGI drivers you have all been waiting for! ;->

  These drivers support a wide range of VGA cards, and should work on
all major brands.

Card types supported: (SuperVGA drivers)
  Ahead, ATI, Chips & Tech, Everex, Genoa, Paradise, Oak, Trident (both 8800 
and 8900, 9000), Tseng (both 3000 and 4000 chipsets) and Video7.
  These drivers will also work on video cards with VESA capability.
  The tweaked drivers will work on any register-compatible VGA card.

I have not tested these drivers on all these card types, so I can not guarantee
perfect operation with your card.  I have tested them extensively
on Trident, Tseng and ATI cards, and have had no problems. (Trident 8800
cards occasionally have problems, especially older models)

Modes currently supported:
  SuperVGA 16-color
   0) Standard EGA/VGA 320x200x16
   1) Standard EGA/VGA 640x200x16
   2) Standard EGA/VGA 640x350x16
   3) Standard VGA 640x480x16
   4) SuperVGA/VESA 800x600x16
   5) SuperVGA/VESA 1024x768x16

  SuperVGA 256-color
   0) Standard VGA/MCGA 320x200x256
   1) 256k Svga/VESA 640x400x256
   2) 512k Svga/VESA 640x480x256

 * NEW SuperVGA 32768-color BGI driver for Tseng ET4000 and ATI XL cards 
   with Sierra HiColor DACs
   
  SuperVGA 32768-color
   0) 320x200x32768

   3) 640x480x32768
   4) 800x600x32768

  * WARNING: The tweaked drivers do not use standard BIOS modes, instead
    they program the CRTC directly.  You must have a register-compatible
    VGA card to use these drivers. You must also be sure that your monitor
    can handle the sync rates (the sync COULD damage your monitor)

   4) 768x576x16
   5) 784x588x16
   6) 800x600x16

  Tweaked 256-color
   0) 320x400x256
   1) 320x480x256
   2) 360x480x256

   Uses extended features of the S3 chip to provide enhanced performance.
   (All functions work, though there is still a bug in putimage)

  S3 Accelerator 16/256/32768-color
   0) 640x480x256
   1) 800x600x256
   2) 1024x768x256
   3) 800x600x16
   4) 1024x768x16
   5) 1280x960x16
   6) 1280x1024x16
   7) 640x480x32768

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:
  Using the driver in existing programs is easy. (If you have the source)

  Check the files INITSVGA.C and INITSVGA.PAS for examples of installation
into C and Pascal programs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: 

 * The mouse cursor may not work in all modes of my driver.  This is because
   no current mouse drivers support SuperVGA/Tweak modes.

 * Registerfarbgidriver DOES work properly with C/C++... (8/1/91)
   Check INITSVGA.C and the makefile for examples of how to use.

 * Registerbgidriver also works with Turbo Pascal. Check the file newinit.pas
   for an example.

 * Imagesize does not work. (the kernel does not call the driver to do this)
   Use the following formulas:
    * imsize = ((xwid >> 1)+1)*ywid+4; 	(16-color)
    * imsize = xwid*ywid+4; 		(256-color)
    * imsize = 2*xwid*ywid+4;		(32768-color)

 * The .CHR files needed by the VGADEMO program are version 1.00 (dated
   October 1987), so if the fonts do not work properly with the demo program,
   you are probably using the newer fonts (eg. 1.1 dated June 1989 do not work
   properly).  This is a fault of the BGI kernel that the demo program was
   compiled with (Turbo Pascal 5.5 doesn't recognize the newer version)

 * If nothing appears on the screen when you draw in 256/32k modes, try
   setting the draw color to white (15 on Svga256, see notes.32k for Svga32k)
   The BGI kernel sets the initial draw color to the maximum color (255),
   which is usually black.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING: The drivers do not test to see if the card installed is
actually a VGA card (If the Svga drivers do not detect a SuperVGA card, they 
treat the card as a standard VGA), so DO NOT use the drivers if you do not 
have a VGA card installed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
REGISTRATION:
  I have decided to release these drivers free of charge,
although donations would be greatly appreciated and certainly
expedite the release of future versions. :->

drivers may have some functions yet unimplemented.  

Registration fees:

	SuperVGA S3			$20
	SuperVGA 32768			$20
	SuperVGA 256 			$20
	SuperVGA 16			$20

	Tweak 256			$20

	Any two:			$30
	Any three:			$40
	Any four:			$50
	Any five:			$60
	All six:			$70

With donations of $20 and up, you will be considered a registered user.
Registered users get the full source code and upgrades on future releases.

I have started working on a new graphics library that will support resolutions
from 160x200 (Ick! ;->) all the way up to 1280x1024, and from 1-bit color
to 24-bit color.  It will support a wide range of cards and I need testers
for XGA/8514/Hercules Graphics Station cards.
(Note: This library is NOT a BGI driver.  It attempts to fix some of the 
       problems I've found with the BGI kernel, ie. the number of colors is
       limited to 256 in the BGI kernel)
