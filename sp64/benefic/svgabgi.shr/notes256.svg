SuperVGA 256 BGI driver 
Version 2.4
June 12, 1992

This is the newest version of my SuperVGA 256 BGI driver.  I have fixed 
several bugs in the previous releases, as well as added several improvements.

	o 1024x768x256 color mode is now supported on Tseng 4000,
	  Chips&Tech, Trident 8900 and Ahead video cards.

	o Getimage and putimage will work with bitmaps up to the 
	 size of available memory. (> 64k)

	o VESA support has been added.

	o Added setvgapalette256 function.

	o Floodfill is implemented. (still slow!) (2.0)

	o Added new logical operations to putimage (2.25)
	  XNOR_PUT
	  NOR_PUT
	  NAND_PUT
	  TRANS_COPY_PUT - Treats 0 as transparent (useful for cursors)

	o Logical operations for putimage actually work correctly! ;-> (2.3)

	o Fixed minor line drawing bug (2.31)

	o Support for the S3 card (non-native mode) has been added (2.4)

	o Paging has been implemented for SuperVGA cards that support it (2.4)
	  (Currently only support Tseng4000, C&T, Paradise and Video7;
	   ATI and Genoa cards do not support paging above 64k)
