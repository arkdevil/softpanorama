SuperVGA 16 BGI driver
Version 1.5
June 12, 1992

This is the latest version of my 16 color BGI driver.  All functions have
been implemented (including paging and floodfill), and should work like
the EGAVGA driver.

	o Fixed putimage bug. Now logical operations work the way they
	  are supposed to. ;->

	o Added new logical operations to putimage:
	  XNOR_PUT
	  NAND_PUT
	  NOR_PUT

	o Fixed VESA support

	o Support for the S3 card (non-native mode) has been added (1.5)

	o Enhanced paging support (1.5)
