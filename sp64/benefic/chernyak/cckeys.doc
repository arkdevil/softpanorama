 When you execute command under this shell you automatically receive 
 the following benefits:

 - you're able to cancel almost any program via Ctrl-Alt-Del. To really 
   force PC reboot issue Ctrl-Alt-Del from the commander itself.
 - any character oriented program is able to handle mouse movements and
   left button pressure (ENTER).
 - You can switch off the internal speaker for too noisy games etc.
 - If command you executed stayed TSR you'll receive the message.
 - If you issued SET or PATH command it will have the effect until you
   exit commander at all.

                        ---------------

   There're a hundred of features in commander. Just not hesitate to
