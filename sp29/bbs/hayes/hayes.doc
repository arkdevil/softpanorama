Notes:1. Default modes are indicated by *
      2. Commands entered with null parameters assume 0-X is the same as X0.
      3. When used with the SC11014 modem IC, which has CCITT V.21 as well
         as V.22 modes, when the ATB command is used, in the answer mode,
         the SC11008 will put the SC11014 in either the V.21 mode or
         the V.22 mode, depending on the resopnse from the remote modem.
         In the originate mode, the SC11008 will sense if the baud rate is
         set at 300 or 1200 bits per second and will adjust the SC11014
         accordingly.

                     Connected at 300 bps., if result of X1, X2, X3 or X4
                     command
2     RING           Ringing singal detected (Note 1)
3     NO CARRIER     Carrier singal not detected or lost
4     ERROR          Illegal command
                     Error in command line
                     Command line exceeds buffer (40 character,
                     including punctuation)
                     Invalid character format at 1200 bps.
5     CONNECT 1200   Connected at 1200 bps. Results from X1, X2, X3
                     or X4 commands only
6     NO DIALTONE    Dialtone not detected and subsequent commands not
                     processed. Results from X2 or X4 commands only.
7     BUSY           Busy signal detected and subsequent commands not
                     processed. Results from X3 or X4 commands only.
8     NO ANSWER      Silence not detected and subsequent commands not
                     processed. Results from @ command only.

Note  1. When the SC11008 detects a ringing on the telephone line, it sends
         a RING result code. However, the SC11008 will answer the call only
         if it is in auto-answer mode or is given an A command.
