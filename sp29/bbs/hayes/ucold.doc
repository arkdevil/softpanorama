AT	Attention code, modem should respond with "OK"

	Dialling ...
	~~~~~~~~~~~~
ATDnnnn		Dial in default mode
ATDPnnnn	Pulse dial
ATDTnnnn	Tone dial
0123456789	Numbers to dial
,		3.5 seconds pause
# $		MF codes
+		Mode
/A		Redial last number ( actually repeat last command everywhere )

	Note:	Modem uses 'A' to recognize DTE speed and
		'T' to recognize parity. Current call may be aborted prior
		to the two modems achieving a Carrier lock-on by pressing
		<CR> key.

	Disconnecting ...
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No data for 1 second ... +++ ... No data for 1 second ... ATH0

		The 1 second requrements are "guard time", which allows
		the modem to recognize +++ as command, not the data.

	Note:	If connection failed, modem will implement a 3 minute
		Blacklist timer period, any call in these three minutes
		will fail with result NO CARRIER. Only way to abort
		Blacklist timer is press reset button. However, incloming
		calls may still be Auto Answered.
