                                    LICENSE



      Telix is Copyright (c) 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989 by Exis Inc.

      Telix is not, nor has ever been, public domain or free software.

      The commercial, registered version of Telix may not be duplicated
      other than for backup purposes. A registered copy of Telix must be
      treated like a book, in that the same registered copy of Telix may
      not be used in more than one computer at the same time, just as a
      book may not be read by more than one person at the same time
      (without making an illegal copy).

      Users are granted a limited license to use the User Supported, trial
      version of Telix for a limited evaluation period of up to 45 days,
      in order to determine if it suits their needs. Any other use of
      Telix or use past this period requires registration.

      All users are granted a limited license to copy the User Supported
      version of Telix only for the purpose of allowing others to try it,
      subject to the above restrictions as well as these:

           Telix must be distributed in absolutely unmodified form, in-
           cluding ALL program, documentation, and other files.

           Telix may not be included with any other product for any reason
           whatsoever without a license from Exis.

           No charge or payment may be levied or accepted for Telix.

      Bulletin Board system operators may post the unregistered, User Sup-
      ported version of Telix on their BBS for downloading by their users
      without written permission only if the above conditions are met, and
      only if no special fee is necessary to access the Telix files (a
      general fee to access the BBS is ok).

      Distributors of User Supported and Public Domain software MUST ob-
      tain written permission from Exis Inc. before distributing Telix and
      must follow the above conditions. Permission is almost always
      granted; this requirement is necessary to ensure protection for our-
      selves and Telix users from unscrupulous individuals.

      The following section contains information on registration and li-
      censing.

                                                                   ii




                       REGISTRATION/ORDERING INFORMATION

      Registering Telix allows you to use the product after the trial pe-
      riod. Registered Telix users get the current copy of Telix on disk
      along with their own serial number, mailed notification of major
      Telix updates, and priority when calling the Telix Software support
      BBS (we guarantee no support to unregistered users). Most impor-
      tantly, registered users know they are helping to make sure that
      high-quality software like Telix continues to be sold in this low-
      cost way.

      Telix registration costs $39 US / $44 CDN, and includes a
      'registered' copy of Telix on disk. An evaluation disk with the cur-
      rent copy of Telix on it is also available for $10 US / $12 CDN.
      This is to be used to try out Telix, and does not include registra-
      tion (the right to use Telix after the evaluation period). The fee
      covers the cost of diskette(s) and handling.

      Payment may be in the form of check, money order, or with a VISA
      card (we expect Mastercard availability before 2/90, please call for
      confirmation). We also accept corporate purchase orders for amounts
      of $39 US and over. All US dollar checks must be drawn on a US bank,
      and all Canadian dollar checks must be drawn on a Canadian bank.
      VISA orders can be charged in Canadian funds only.

      To place an order, please use the order form on the following page,
      or call us at (416)-289-4641 with your VISA card.


                        QUANTITY AND CORPORATE PURCHASES

      The order form on the following page may be used to purchase mul-
      tiple copies of Telix, with discounts as follows:

                  1 -  10 copies     no discount
                 11 -  20 copies    10% discount
                 21 -  50 copies    15% discount

                200+      copies    40% discount

      Purchases of up to 50 copies are bulk purchases and include that
      many copies of Telix on disk, as with single registrations. Pur-
      chases of 51 or more copies are site licenses. Exis Inc. provides a
      master copy of Telix and the appropriate number of diskette labels.
      The licensee is responsible for copying the disks (backups of the
      MASTER do not count towards the total copies in the license).

      The name on the order form is considered the contact and is the per-
      son with whom all correspondence will take place.



      Note: All prices and discounts are subject to change without notice.
      Discounts apply only to separate orders, they are not cumulative.
