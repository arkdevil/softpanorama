The legalities
--------------
As far as I know, this set of programs does exactly what I claim it will do.
However, I am definitely NOT guaranteeing that.  You are using the package
entirely at your own risk.  If it does cause problems that appear to be
program related, contact me at the BBS number above.  Please cage and
forward any error messages or other manifestations of the errors.
My address is supplied at the beginning and end of this document.

This is NOT a free, or public domain, package.  This is shareware.  In order
for you to be using the package legally, you must register the program with
me.  The registration details are explained later in this document.

No changes, revisions, deletions, or additions to this package may be made by
anyone but the author.  If you have an idea on how I can make this package
better, write me.  Don't patch files.  I will not be responsible for, nor can
I support, other people's modifications.

Third-party shareware distributors (BBSes, user groups, etc.) may distribute
this package freely, as long as they do not charge a fee which is more than
their cost of distribution.  The author is the only person authorized to make
a profit on this package.

I retain all copyrights to this program.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The package
-----------
...consists of five short executable programs.  They are:
                T3DARWIN.EXE - program to adapt Darwin BBS lists to Telix 3.xx.
                T3EDIT.EXE   - program to edit Telix 3.xx dialing directories.
                T3GLOBAL.EXE - program to globally change all entries in a
                               Telix 3.xx dialing directory.
                T3PRINT.EXE  - program to print some or all of the data in a
                               Telix 3.xx dialing directory.
                T3SORT.EXE   - program to sort a Telix 3.xx dialing directory
                               on one of several key fields.

There should also be two other files in the package:
                T3TOOLS.DOC  - which you are now reading.
                $TOC         - which is a PKUNPAK (tm) view of the Telix 3
                               Tools package.  If you suspect you have a
                               corrupted (or illegally modified) archive, run
                               PKUNPAK -v and save the output.  Then send me
                               both your output and $TOC.  I can use the two
                               files to verify your copy of the package.

It's designed for IBM PC's and close compatibles.  It uses the DOS and CRT
units of Borland's Turbo Pascal 5.0 (tm).  If your computer cannot run TP5
programs, these won't work, either.  Otherwise, you should have no problems.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assumption
----------
If you do not have Telix 3.00, 3.10, or 3.11 (tm) (and if you have any,
it should be version 3.11), this package is useless to you.  Therefore, I
am going to assume you have Telix 3.xx, and know a little about it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage
-----
I have tried to make the programs as self-documenting as possible.  Entering
the program name alone (or with only the /H switch) on the command line will
give you a short help screen.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0. Syntax

   InFile  -- the input file for that program.
   OutFile -- the output file for that program.
   [stuff] -- bracketed selections are optional.
   stuff   -- non-bracketed selections MUST be provided or the program will
              abort.
   <key>   -- the keyboard keys to hit when needed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. T3PRINT
   Command line: T3PRINT [/op] InFile [OutFile]

   [/op] - A slash, followed by up to five option letters from the following
           list:

           [DEFAULT: Standard data shown.  See 'OutFile' below for what is
                     displayed and its format]

           H - show help screen [must be only option, remainder of command
                                 line is ignored].
           A - use all extra options [must be only option].

           C - show date of last call and number of calls.
           P - show passwords.  This is optional so that you don't
               accidentally give all your passwords to your best friend
               when you give him/her your list of numbers.
           T - show the settings for the five (or four in Telix 3.00) toggle
               switches.  The output in this column is a 10-character string.
               Decoding the toggle string:
               Option: 1 2 3 4 5
                 True: HiDlNoLfFd
                False: --BsDe--Hd
               1 - Strip High Bit: 'Hi' means high-bit stripping is on.
                   '--' means it's off (for Telix 3.00 directories, this
                   should always be off).
               2 - BS key sends: 'Dl' means Delete (ASCII 127).  'Bs' means
                   Backspace (ASCII 8).
               3 - BS translation: 'No' means non-destructive (cursor left),
                   'De' means destructive backspace (backspace key).
               4 - Add line feeds: 'Lf' means line feeds are added. '--'
                   means they're not.
               5 - Local echo: 'Fd' means Full Duplex (local echo off). 'Hd'
                   means Half Duplex (local echo on).
           S - show linked script names for each BBS.
           M - show the default terminal type for each BBS.

   InFile - the Telix 3.xx dialing directory you want printed.  InFile must
            exist, and exactly as shown.  If you are running T3PRINT from a
            different directory than the .FON file, specify a full enough
            pathname for the program to find it.  If the dialing directory
            cannot be found, the program will abort.

   [OutFile] - the file which will receive the list.  If not specified, it
               will be 'standard output' -- which means the output could be
               redirected to another program.  For example, you could use
               Vern Buerg's LIST (tm) to view the output as part of a pipe:
                    T3PRINT /A TELIX.FON | LIST /S
               would allow you to see a full printout of TELIX.FON without
               permanently tying up disk space.

               If OutFile is a disk file, and it exists, it will be appended
               to.  Otherwise, it will be created (if possible).

               The output file format, without any options, shows the dialing
               directory entry number, name, phone number, baud, data bits,
               parity, stop bits, default transfer protocol, and dialing
               prefix across the page from left to right.  The additional
               fields are added from left to right in the order shown above.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. T3SORT
   Command line: T3SORT [/op] InFile [OutFile]

   [/op] - A slash, followed by up to two option letters from the following
           list:

           [DEFAULT: /A]

           H - show help screen [must be only option, remainder of command
                                 line is ignored].

           A - sort the InFile by BBS name, in A-to-Z (ascending) order.
           C - sort the InFile by last call date, most recent going first and
               the ones you've never called going last.  The secondary sort
               key is the total calls field.
           D - sort the InFile by BBS name, in Z-to-A (descending) order.
           L - sort the InFile by the BBS's 7-digit local number, in ascending
               order.  The program skips embedded long distance prefixes.  For
               this option to work correctly, numbers outside your area code
               must start with the sequence '1-xxx' (where xxx is the other
               area code) or a long distance prefix.
           N - sort the InFile by the Phone Number field.  This will sort
               based on whatever the first character of the phone number is.
           T - sort the InFile by the total number of calls made, in descending
               order.  The secondary sort key is the BBS Name field.

           F - the OutFile will be overwritten without confirmation if you
               use this switch.  If you leave this out, and the OutFile exists,
               you will be asked at run-time to confirm that you really do
               want to do this.  If you choose not to overwrite the OutFile,
               you can specify another filename -- which will also be checked
               and verified if necessary.

   InFile - the Telix 3.xx dialing directory you are sorting.  See the 'InFile'
            entry under 'T3PRINT' above for pathname rules.

   [OutFile] - the sorted Telix 3.xx dialing directory you are creating.  If
               an OutFile is not specified, the InFile will also be the
               OutFile.  See the 'F' switch above for how the OutFile is
               handled if it already exists.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. T3EDIT
   Command line: T3EDIT [/H] [/F] InFile [OutFile]

   [/H] - show help screen.  Do not enter any other command line data, as it
          is ignored.
   [/F] - force OutFile to be overwritten regardless of its prior existence.
   InFile - the Telix 3.xx dialing directory you are editing.  See the
            'InFile' entry under 'T3PRINT' above for pathname rules.  For this
            program, however, a non-existent InFile yields a one-blank-entry
            OutFile.  This allows you to create new dialing directories with
            T3EDIT.
   [OutFile] - the edited Telix 3.xx dialing directory.  If OutFile is not
               specified, it is assumed to be InFile.  If OutFile already
               exists, and you don't force an overwrite with /F, you will
               be asked to confirm that you really wanted to do that.

   What to do when the program is running:
   The menu and display is all on one screen.  The top line shows the number
   of records in the file, as well as the number of the current record.
   All commands and menu entries are one-key entries.  That's why the menu
   letters down the left side of the screen jump around a bit -- the commands
   are designed to be as obvious as possible.  Requests for data or keystrokes
   are displayed on line 24 of your screen (one line above the bottom of a
   CGA/MDA screen).  The valid choices for T3EDIT are the letters A to S,
   X to Z, and the <#> key:
   [NOTE 1: I have not been able to design a good interactive edit in Pascal.
            Therefore, you'll have to completely re-type any entries that
            require text.  Sorry about that, Chief (oops).  I hope to have
            this fixed for future Telix Tools releases.]
   [NOTE 2: Items A to J, and the <#> key, can be aborted by pressing the
            <ENTER> key immediately when asked for data on line 24.  The
            field will then be left unchanged.]
   [NOTE 3: You will be asked to confirm that you want to leave no matter
            which flavor of exit command you use.  This is for your own
            protection.  Confirmation prompts take <Y> or <N> only.]
        <A> - BBS Name: You then type in the new name for this BBS.  There
              is a 25-character limit.
        <B> - Number: You then type in the phone number.  You can enter long
              distance prefixes and postfixes, if you wish.  There is a 17-
              character limit.
        <C> - Settings: You'll see a menu across line 24.  Unfortunately, I
              had to abbreviate baud rates due to space limitations.  From
              left to right they are: 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200,
              38400, 57600, 115200 baud.  Hit the number key corresponding
              to the baud rate desired.  Then key in the data, parity, and
              stop bit information (<8><N><1>, for example).
        <D> - Password: You then type in a new 14-character-or-less password.
        <E> - Script: You then type in a new 12-character-or-less logon script
              name.
        <F> - Last Call: You then type in the date of your last call.  It MUST
              be in the format 'MM/DD/YY' (or whatever order you use).  There
              must be numbers in positions 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8 in the
              8-character field.
        <G> - Total Calls: Enter the number of calls made.
        <H> - Terminal: Select the terminal type from the menu on line 24.
        <I> - Protocol: Enter one character for your default protocol.  The
              character is not checked as I don't know your external protocol
              situation.
        <J> - Dialing Pre: Enter a number from 1 to 3 for the dialing prefix
              you are using.
        <K> - Strip HiBit: This is a toggle for the Strip High Bit setting.
              TRUE means Strip High Bit is ON, FALSE means OFF.
        <L> - BS/Delete: This is a toggle for the BS Key Sends setting.
        <M> - BS Trans: This is a toggle for the BS Translation setting.
        <N> - COMMAND: Next Record: Moves you forward one record in the file.
              If you're on the final record, you circle around to record #1.
        <O> - Add LFs: This is a toggle for the Add Line Feeds setting.
              TRUE means Add Line Feeds is ON, FALSE means OFF.
              It is the letter <O>, not the numeral <0>.
        <P> - COMMAND: Previous Record: Moves you back one record in the file.
              If you're on the first record, you circle back to the last one.
        <Q> - COMMAND: Quit without changes: Allows you to leave the file
              unchanged.  Use this if you really screw up the works and want
              to try again.
        <R> - Duplex: This is a toggle for the Local Echo setting.  'Full'
              duplex means Local Echo is OFF, 'Half' Duplex means Local Echo
              is ON.
        <S> - COMMAND: Save without deleting: Allows you to save the entire
              file whether or not you have tagged anything for deletion.  The
              delete markers are not saved, so use this only if you're sure
              you want to keep deleted fields.
        <X> - COMMAND: Exit and delete: Saves all records except those you
              mark for deletion (see <Z>).  Deleted records cannot be
              recovered once you end the program.
        <Y> - COMMAND: Add a record: Appends a blank record to the file, and
              places you on it for editing.
        <Z> - COMMAND: Mark for deletion: If FALSE appears here, the record
              will be kept.  If TRUE appears here, and you end the program
              with the <X> command, this record will be erased.  Delete flags
              are not saved at exit.
        <#> - COMMAND: Jump to number: You'll be asked to enter the number
              of the record to move to.  An out of range number will be
              corrected to the nearest end of the file.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. T3GLOBAL
   Command line: T3GLOBAL [/H | InFile]

   [/H] - show help screen.  Do not include a filename if you are asking for
          help; it will be ignored.
   InFile - the Telix 3.xx dialing directory you are updating.  See the
            'InFile' entry under 'T3PRINT' above for pathname rules.

   What to do when the program is running:
   Once the program is going, you get a simple menu screen with lettered
   choices.  Hitting the letter on the keyboard activates a choice.  Whatever
   information you need will be shown on line 24 of your screen (the next-to-
   last line of a standard CGA/MDA screen).  If 'No change' appears next to an
   entry, that means T3GLOBAL will not change that area of any directory
   record.  If anything else appears, ALL of your directory records will be
   changed to that setting.  If you have set a global change, and you'd like
   to delete it -- hit the same letter key again.  If you are asked for more
   information, hit <ENTER>.  This will (eventually) clear away any errant
   settings.  The valid choices for T3GLOBAL are the letters A through L,
   and Q:
        <A> - Line settings:  When you hit <A>, a one-line menu pops up on
              line 24 -- hit the number key indicating the baud rate you wish
              to change to, or the <ENTER> key to clear a previous setting.  If
              you choose a baud rate, you'll also have to choose global settings
              for data, parity, and stop bit information.  You cannot change the
              baud rate globally without changing the remaining line setting
              information.
        <B> - Call data:  This is a toggle between 'No change' and 'To be
              cleared'.  If 'To be cleared' appears here, the date of your last
              call and the total number of calls made will be erased in every
              record of your dialing directory.
        <C> - Password: Similar to <B>, for Password field.
        <D> - Script: Similar to <B>, for Logon Script field.
        <E> - Term Type: The menu that comes up on line 24 shows the
              available terminal types.  Hit the number key corresponding to
              the global terminal type you want, or <ENTER> to reset the
              field.
        <F> - Protocol: You then enter one character as your global protocol
              choice.  <ENTER> clears away a prior choice, otherwise the
              character is not checked as I don't know whether you have any
              external protocols set up.
        <G> - Dial Pref: You then enter a number from 1 to 3 as your global
              dialing prefix, or <ENTER> to reset the field.
        <H> - Strip Hi: A three-way toggle for the Strip High Bit field.  It
              can say 'No change' (which leaves the field alone), 'forced
              TRUE' (which sets the field to TRUE for all records), or 'forced
              FALSE' (which sets the field to FALSE).  Hitting the <H> key
              several times will cycle through the toggle until you reach
              the one you want.
        <I> - BS or Del: Similar to <H>, for the BS Key Sends field.
        <J> - BS Trans: Similar to <H>, for the BS Translation field.
        <K> - Add LF: Similar to <H>, for the Add Line Feeds field.
        <M> - Duplex: Similar to <H>, for the Local Echo field.  'Full' Duplex
              is equivalent to Local Echo OFF, 'Half' Duplex to Local Echo ON.
        <Q> - COMMAND: Quit: Processes all global changes.  There is no
              confirmation, so check the screen VERY carefully before hitting
              <Q>uit.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. T3DARWIN
   Command line: T3DARWIN [/H] [/F] InFile OutFile

   [/H] - show help screen.  All other command line information is ignored.
   [/F] - force OutFile to be overwritten without confirmation.
   InFile - must be a valid Darwin BBS text file.  This program was written
            based on the format of USBBS54.LST (November, 1988 edition).
   OutFile - will be a Telix 3.xx dialing directory.  If OutFile exists, and
             you have not specified /F (force) mode, you'll be asked to
             confirm that you want to overwrite the OutFile, or change the
             name of the OutFile.

   What to do when the program is running:
   Due to the enormous size of the Darwin list, some screening is required
   to get the dialing directory down to a manageable size.  There are three
   criteria used to screen the list.  The program accepts them from standard
   input, which means you can redirect the input from a text file (it's
   recommended you use the /F switch so that your redirection script doesn't
   get loused up).

   1. Area code: Enter (one at a time) each area code you want included in
      the OutFile.  Hit <ENTER> on the first request to skip area code
      processing.
   2. State: Enter (one at a time) each 2-letter Post Office state abbreviation
      you want included in the OutFile.  Again, hitting <ENTER> on the first
      request skips this screening section.
   3. BBS Type: Enter (all on one line) the single-letter codes for the BBS
      types you want included.  Hitting <ENTER> on a blank line again skips
      this section.

   If you skip all three sections, the program aborts.  Otherwise, it will
   run through the Darwin file, showing you the current line count and current
   OutFile entry count in the center of the screen.
   This process will take some time, and if it yields too large of a file,
   you will be asked to do it again... screening it a little more tightly this
   time.

Usage notes
-----------
Due to the fact that most of the processing in these programs is done
in memory -- and the fact that the data segment of a Turbo Pascal program
is limited to 64KB -- the largest dialing directory that Telix Tools can
handle is 710 entries.  If you have more than that, consider splitting the
directory into two or more smaller ones.  If enough registered users ask,
I'll write a program to do just that.

You can abort the programs (using Ctrl-Break or Ctrl-C, whichever usually works
with Turbo Pascal programs) at any time before you get a "Writing FILENAME.FON"
message without losing any files.  Once the program begins writing, however,
you have to let it finish... or else the output file WILL be trashed.

As always when working with data you consider important, you may wish to backup
each dialing directory you process before you start.  This is to insure that
(1) you don't make a fatal mistake and (2) that I didn't.  When you consider
that the passwords contained in a Telix dialing directory are almost
irreplaceable, you really can't be too safe.

If you're using DOS 3.00 or higher, the help screens will begin with a "command
line" that shows the actual filename of the program.  This way, you can rename
your program to something less finger-twisting than my names and still have
a sensible help screen.  Command-line filename reading began with DOS 3.00.
If you have DOS 2.11 or lower, you'll get my name for the program on your
help screen instead of yours.  That's not my fault... but DOS's.  With DOS
4.0x out, it may be time to upgrade.

Registered users
----------------
If you're not yet a registered user of Telix, do that first (the information
is in the Telix package).

Then, you become registered for the Telix Tools by sending $10.00 to the
address shown below.  Registered users will receive support as needed,
bug fixes as they are released, and notification of major changes in the
Telix Tools.

At this time, no major changes are planned unless Telix 4.00 comes out.
However, your registration will allow you to keep up with the Telix Tools
until the next overhaul.

GupList  - a support program for the PCBoard door 'Card Guppies'.  It produces
           a text file (bulletin) after every run of 'Guppies', so that the
           game's players can check their scores without re-loading the game.

TimedAsk - a batch file program, similar to Norton's ASK, which times the
           user's response and sends default results if there is no response
           within the desired time.  Useful for batch files which run
           unattended... sometimes.
