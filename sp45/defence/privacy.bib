Howdy,

I have been having an e-mail conversation with Stacy Veeder for several 
days on the topic of e-mail privacy. She mailed me this bibliography
which she has compiled for two papers which she is currently writing.

I post it here with permission.

PS - She is interested in talking with anyone who has some views on the 
topic/information to share.

Mark N.

Howdy,

This is a compilation of various files relating to computer crime and 
security (or computers in general) which I have gathered from
around the internet.

All files are available electronically, but not in the same space. I have
begun to upload them to the Sydney Univ. Law School anon. ftp 
site (sulaw.law.su.oz.au). Not all of these files are available _yet_, but
hopefully (time and _space_ permitting) they will soon be available.

This list constitutes about a third of the files I presently have in my 
possession. No doubt there are many more!

Please do NOT e-mail me requesting copies. I am uploading them as fast 
as possible to the ftp site.

I AM interested in hearing from people (a) who are prepared to offer
space on their FTP site to store these or similar files or (b) who
have copies of other similar files not mentioned below!
