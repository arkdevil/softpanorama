This special free report is only a small subset of what you'll find in the
full database.   For example, in addition to containing more products, the
full database contains many prices for each item, since you often are willing
to pay $10 or $20 more to buy from a vendor you trust.

We regret that we can't answer questions about information in this free
report or provide vendor phone numbers or price quotes.  Orders for
subscriptions to the full report ($29.95/year) can be made by mailing to
sp-request@clarinet.com or phoning 1-800-USE-NETS.  (For info call +1 408

If you know a better price than one contained in the report, mail it
to sp-contribute@clarinet.com with vendor and source information.
(Please include phone numbers and other contact info.)  If you're the
first with the lowest price for the next report, we'll give you free
subscription credits good towards the SPR or other ClariNet
electronic publications.   ClariNet publishes a full electronic
newspaper with over 1 mb/day of news, sports, finance, stock, technology,
