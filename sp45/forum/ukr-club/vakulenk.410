|Hello.  I am looking for conversion programs to translate some
|Cyrillic fonts
|into other Cyrillic fonts.  In particular, I am using the Casady & Greene
|"Glasnost" package of fonts which have a "Soviet"-style
|keyboard map.  However,
|I was told that the most popular ASCII conversion table in the CIS is KOI-8.
|A message with KOI-8 text inside looks like gibberish to me.  I
|have a Mac and
|a friend of mine has a Fontographer utility which can be used to re-map the
|characters.  However, I am very reluctant to "reinvent the wheel" and have
|more interest in history than in programming.  Can anyone help, please.

Most Cyrillic fonts use the IBM standard keyboard mapping and ASCII
values below 128 for their characters.  KOI-7 and -8, on the other
hand, are methods of transliteration (converting Cyrillic characters
into English phonems, represented with Roman characters).  After
converting Cyrillic to KOI, it no longer matches the ASCII values for
most Cyrillic fonts, so you can't just select the text and change the
font to Cyrillic.

What you need is a transliteration utility which will convert your
Cyrillic ASCII codes to KOI codes and back again.  Funny coincidence,
but I was noting the lack of such a utility last night, so I started
writing one for Windows; it only transliterates to KOI (not back) right
now, but I hope to have it done in a few weeks (both English and
Russian versions) and I'll make it available to anyone when it's finished.

However, KOI is mostly a waste of time, since you can send Cyrillic
ASCII via email and the receiver only needs to select the text and
change the font to Cyrillic for it to appear correctly; this technique
is computer-independent, provided both people have a Cyrillic font that
maps to the IBM standard (Soviet) keyboard.  I've attached some
information I put together for people here at Microsoft; ignore the
references to server locations and you should find it informative.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 8) What's transliteration?

    Transliteration is the process of translating one language into
    another, using the characters and phonems of the second language.
    This is very common for email sent in Russian, since Cyrillic
    characters cannot be sent through email (see #9 below).  For
    example, an email message may be entirely in Russian, but will
    be written using Roman characters, like "kak dela?" (which
    is Russian for "how have you been doing?").

    There are many methods for transliterating Russian to English,
    but two of the most common are KOI-7 and the Library of Congress
    codes.  KOI-7 provides a one-to-one-character relationship which
    is popular among heavy computer users, while the Library of
    Congress method is considered more easily read in email.  Both
    are shown below:

 9) How can I send a message or file in Cyrillic through email?

    Email is sent between sites using a protocol called UUCP, which
    does not support standard 8-bit characters.  Therefore, files

    containing formatting and character properties (bold, italic -
    composed in Word for Windows or other word processors) cannot be
    sent through email.  There are three solutions to this problem:
    transliteration, text-only file transfer, and UUencoding.
    Transliteration (see #8 above) is very common, while text-only
    file transfer and UUencoding are rare.  There are limitations
    with each method that you should consider before making your
    decision, but text-only file transfer seems to be the most
    efficient if it is available to you.

    Transliteration is easily accomplished, but requires that you
    convert all your Cyrillic text into English phonems; of course,
    all formatting and character properties will be lost.  To
    transliterate a message or file, convert all the Cyrillic
    characters as specified in #8 above.

    Text-only file transfer allows you to send Cyrillic text, but
    requires that the recipient have a word processor which supports
    Cyrillic fonts.  To convert Cyrillic to text-only, open the file
    with your word processor and save it in text-only format; note
    that all formatting and character properties will be lost.
    Append or paste the text-only file into your email message and
    send it.  The recipient will need to copy the text to their word
    processor or save the email message as a file they can open,
    then change the font to Cyrillic.  For example, you could
    compose a message to a friend using a Cyrillic font in Word for
    Windows, save the message as a text-only file, open it with
    Windows' Notepad, and paste it into an email message.  The
    recipient would then save the message as a file, open it with
    Word for Windows, select the text, and change the font to
    Cyrillic.  This method works best if both you and the recipient
    are using the same font, since a few Cyrillic fonts don't use
    standard Soviet keyboard mapping.

    UUencoding allows you to send a file as-is, but requires that
    the recipient have a decoder utility and a word processor which
    can read the file; all formatting and character properties will
    be retained.  UUencoding a file is easy if you use WinMail or MS
    Mail.  Both of these applications allow you to attach a file to
    your email, and that file is automatically UUencoded.  When your
    email is received, the recipient will use a UUdecode utility to
    decode the file.  If you receive a file which has been UUencoded,
    it will appear as an attachment to the email which you may
    extract out to a file and open with a word processor.  If you're
    not using WinMail or MS Mail, or you need to UUencode a file
    without using those applications, you can get utilities from
    \\toolsvr\contrib!culture.cis\uucode.  There is a README.TXT file
    that describes all the files and sub-directories.

 1) How can I use Cyrillic fonts in a Dos application?

    Most popular word processors support Cyrillic fonts, inherently
    or through a language module.  Diplomat Software makes the
    Russian Diplomat, a software package for typing and printing
    Cyrillic characters from most Dos applications, including Word,
    Word Perfect, Ventura Publisher and others.  They can be reached

 2) How can I use Cyrillic fonts in a Windows application?

    A set of TrueType Cyrillic fonts can be found in \\toolsvr
    \contrib!culture.cis\fonts\truetype.  There is a README.TXT file
    that describes all the files and sub-directories.  Note that if
    you are using Windows 3.0 or 3.0a, you must also be running Adobe
    Type Manager (ATM) to use these fonts.

    Cassady & Greene and Adobe Systems make Cyrillic fonts for
    Windows; either package should be available through most mail-
    order or local software stores.


 3) How can I use Cyrillic fonts in a Macintosh application?

    Cassady & Greene and Adobe Systems make Cyrillic fonts; either
    package should be available through most mail-order or local
    software stores.

    Bersearch Information Services makes a sans-serif Cyrillic font
    called RussianH which matches the height, weight, and style of
    Helvetica.  It includes several keyboard layouts, including IBM
    standard and phonetic.  They can be reached at:

 5) How can I keep up on the latest Cyrillic utilities?

    glps Products publishes Computing In Russian, a bi-monthly
    newsletter of Cyrillic product information, Dos/Windows/Macintosh
    application tips, and other information of interest.  It is sub-
    titled the "computing newsletter for Russian-language
    professionals".  Subscriptions are $15.00 US for one year and are
    available from the address given above for glps Products.


 6) How do I know where a Cyrillic character is on the keyboard?

    There are two common keyboard layouts for Cyrillic fonts: IBM and
    phonetic.  Usually, Cyrillic fonts use the IBM standard, which is
    based on IBM typewriters sold in the CIS.  Any Dos application
    which supports Cyrillic fonts should include a keyboard layout
    display.  Under Windows 3.1 you can use the Character Map
    utility, and on the Macintosh you can use the Key Caps desk
    accessory.  Unfortunately, there is no similar utility under
    Windows 3.0 and 3.0a.
