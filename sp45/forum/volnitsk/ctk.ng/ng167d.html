 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

     To make your programm work with some national langage several
     things must be done:

          - keyboard must generate code of simbols corresponding to
            national language keyboard layout;

          - all devices produsing readable output must have national
            font set;

          - all progamm input and output must be translated to national
            language;

     What CTK have as part of get system extentions:

          - keyboard driver with changeable keyboard layout and
            any number of layouts available at run time, i.e. you can
            for example make application handling english russian and
            ukranian text;

          - changeable massages at scoreboard;

          - changeable standart characters T/F at logical get fields to
            any other;

     What you must make for programming applivcation for some
     national languge:

          - you must use builtin CTK keyboard driver or use your
            favourite external keyboard driver. When invoking CTK driver
            you can use ready made layouts in CTK.CH or specify
            your own. See <U>InitCTK()</U>.

          - change (translate yourself or use ready made at <U>InitCTK()</U>)
            scoreboard messages to needed national langauage if you use
            scoreboard.

          - change standart characters T/F at logical get fields to
            true/false national latters if you using logical input.
            See <U>InitCTK()</U>;

          - consider language alphabet order in Index/Seek commands
            and use <B>IndexExp()</B>.

          - change fonts in output devices if needed;


     To simplify some actions you can use ready made Language Schemes
     by calling <U>InitCTK()</U> with argument of needed Language Scheme.
     Builtin Clipper error messages output will be still in english
     but you can write your own errors handler if you need it.
     Here is also altarnative in using national vertions of Clipper.
     In future vertions of CTK there will be screen font loader not
     available so far.
