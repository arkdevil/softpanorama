                    USE OF McAFEE ASSOCIATES PROGRAMS

     The McAfee Associates VIRUSCAN series is distributed as shareware
for home use, but must be licensed for use within a business,
corporation, or organization.  This includes educational institutions
and government agencies.  If you have or suspect computer virus
infection, you are allowed to use the software for five (5) days free of
charge to isolate and remove the computer virus or suspect computer
virus.  We will provide you with assistance if requested.
     If you are a shareware distributor, you may distribute all software
listed below in the registration form as long as you contact McAfee
Associates for permission first.  You must distribute the all the
files intact and in unmodified form (duplicate files may be removed)
and may not charge more than a reasonable disk copying fee.  You must
obtain updates from our BBS at the number below.
     If you are a System Operator and run a publically-accessable BBS
for which their is no fee for use then you may use the software
free of charge--that's our way of saying thanks.
