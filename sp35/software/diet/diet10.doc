What is DIET?
=============
  DIET compresses executable files with DLV-method, dynamic Lempel-Ziv,
into executable files preserving the file names. The method of compression
is similar to Lexem093.exe with @ switch.
  You can create exe or com files in compressed size with a
decompression so fast that you would feel as if you are working with the 
uncompressed original. DIET is similar to LZEXE or PKLITE in concepts
and is an outgrowth of LEXEM which has gained much popularity in Japan.
Some of the new features of DIET are:

*DIET accepts wild cards: 
    Type DIET *.* whenever your storage space causes you a panic.

*DIET uses the same name for a compressed file, and overwrites the original
    on default.

*DIET retrieves the original with the same attributes and time stamp.

*DIET compresses ASCII files, too. 

*DIET can change the original name into another name with -o option.
      You may save the original file with this facility.

*DIET uses new file header which decreases the compressed file size.

*DIET uses only a small portion of available memory in decompression.
    Its size is far smaller than LEXEM uses.

Effective Use of Diet.
======================
What is more comfortable than to type 
    DIET *.*
while similar utilities ask you one command line to compress each file?
You may just type 
    DIET -r *.*
to restore all the files into the original sizes. You may restore
only some of the data files by:
    DIET -r *.dat
    DIET -r *.log
    DIET -r *.pif
and so on. And keep all of your executable files in compressed size.
This utility has minimum amount of switches and commands to go
with Diet. You do not have to read lengthy manual or documents.
Our document itself is compact as your Laptop.

Diet overwrites every file which it compresses, and removes the
original. The compressed file is stored where the original was.
Try to take directory before and after it compressed every thing.
You just get the same list of files in the same order, neat and tidy.


<<< Usage >>>

Usage :  DIET [option] filename [filename]...
Option:  -C      check already compressed
         -R      retrieve original file
         -Oxxxx  output file is xxxx.

This is all what you have to remember with its capability for
accepting wild cards. Parameters in angle braces [....] may be
omitted. For an example,

       DIET \bin\format.com
       
will produce the following message:
          ..
     <<<< executable file compressor DIET ver 1.00 >>>>
          ... copyright 1990   Teddy Matsumoto ...

     Compress '\BIN\FORMAT.COM' .Success! (10208 to 6889 bytes)


The compressed file format.com is in the directory \bin.
To retrieve the original type:

      DIET -r \bin\format.com

What you see is the information:

    <<<< executable file compressor DIET ver 1.00 >>>>
          ... copyright 1990   Teddy Matsumoto ...

     Retrieve original file '\BIN\FORMAT.COM'
     Success! (6889 to 10208 bytes)


Throghout the process of compression and decompression, the time stamp
of the file remains the same.

To check whether some of your files are compressed by DIET use c option.

      DIET -c \bin\*.*

Then you see something like:

     <<<< executable file compressor DIET ver 1.00 >>>>
          ... copyright 1990   Teddy Matsumoto ...

     '\BIN\LHARC.EXE' is already compressed by DIET!
      (packed data size: 20118 bytes  CRC: 0B4B)
     '\BIN\LESS.EXE' is not compressed by DIET!
     '\BIN\LESS.HLP' is already compressed by DIET!
      (packed data size: 400 bytes  CRC: 0572)
     '\BIN\SYS.EXE' is already compressed by DIET!
      (packed data size: 2394 bytes  CRC: 3190)
     '\BIN\SED.EXE' is already compressed by DIET!
      (packed data size: 14057 bytes  CRC: F77B)
     '\BIN\LINK.EXE' is not compressed by DIET!
     '\BIN\SORT.EXE' is already compressed by DIET!
      (packed data size: 928 bytes  CRC: 0B71)
     '\BIN\TEE.COM' is already compressed by DIET!
      (packed data size: 7390 bytes  CRC: 79D4)
     '\BIN\TREE.COM' is already compressed by DIET!
      (packed data size: 1245 bytes  CRC: A1CC)
     '\BIN\DIET.EXE' is not compressed by DIET!
     '\BIN\FGREP.EXE' is already compressed by DIET!
      (packed data size: 9024 bytes  CRC: 5C27)
     '\BIN\PKLITE.EXE' is not compressed by DIET!


Finally, to change output filename you type

         DIET -O\bin\lh.exe \bin\lharc.exe
 
Follwing information is supplied by DIET:   
     .......
     <<<< executable file compressor DIET ver 1.00 >>>>
          ... copyright 1990   Teddy Matsumoto ...

    Compress '\BIN\LHARC.EXE' to '\bin\lh.exe' .Success! (31256 to 20409 bytes)

To see what has happened look the directory:

    dir \bin\lh*

     LHARC    EXE    31256  89-05-21  21:14
     LH       EXE    20409  90-12-23  17:32.


Note that the original file is not overwritten and is kept there.

    DIET -r \bin\lh.exe

     <<<< executable file compressor DIET ver 1.00 >>>>
          ... copyright 1990   Teddy Matsumoto ...

     Retrieve original file '\BIN\LH.EXE'
     Success! (20409 to 31256 bytes)


         dir \bin\lh*
         ------------

     LHARC    EXE    31256  89-05-21  21:14
     LH       EXE    31256  90-12-23  17:32


 You must know the time stamp of lh.exe has been changed, but not the
original lharc.exe's. You can keep the original file if you want to
take some precaustions.
