SHEZ.EXE       The main SHEZ program.
SHEZ.HLP       The help file SHEZ uses.   This file must be in a  directory that
               is defined in your PATH.
SHEZCFG.EXE    The SHEZ  configuration program.   This  program will  modify the
               SHEZ.EXE program with your personal options and defaults.
SHEZ.DOC       The SHEZ documentation. 
SHEZ.REG       The SHEZ registration document.

To start-up SHEZ  simply enter "SHEZ [d:\path\filespec]".   You may specify wild
cards in the filespec. If  you use wild cards in the filespec  SHEZ will present
you with  a scrollable list of  files that it found matching  the filespec. SHEZ
recognizes the special  filename.fileext of $.$.   If you specify a  filespec of
$.$ SHEZ will list only the files  having an extension of .ARC, .ZIP, .LZH, ARJ,
and ZOO, or  the files having extension  matching the extensions that  where set
using  the configuration  program.  SHEZ will  also  recognize just  the  $ file
extension along with a  DOS wildcard filename. For example if you  start SHEZ by
entering SHEZ C:\UTY\P*.$ SHEZ will display a list of files that have a filename
beginning   with   the  letter   P   and   that  have   a   file   extension  of
.ARC,.ZIP,.LZH,.ZOO,.PAK,ARJ,  or what ever you set  the extentions to using the
config. program.

You  may also start SHEZ  and specify a sub-directory  name of the directory you
are currently in.  For example, if you are currently in the C:\UTILITY directory
and you want to work on the files in the C:\UTILITY\PGMS directory start SHEZ by
entering the following: SHEZ PGMS\

Also included  in the file list  will be any  directories that SHEZ found.   The
directory names will  be enclosed in  greater than and  less than symbols.  I.E.
<DIR1>.  You can position  the highlight bar on a  directory name and press  the
enter  key  to view  the  files  and  directories  that are  contained  in  that
directory.   To move up one level in  the directory tree highlight the directory
entry that appears as <..>.   As you change directories the full  disk:\pathname
will be displayed  on the  main screen.   In addition the  disk:\path that  will
receive extracted  files is  also displayed  on the  main screen.  You can  than
choose the file you wish to work on by moving the  highlight bar with the cursor
keys  and pressing  the  enter key.  SHEZ will  then present  you with  a screen
showing the contents of the archive file.

To perform a  function, simply position the  highlight bar and press  the key(s)
that  corresponds to the function you want  to perform on that member.  Pressing
the F1 key will open a window giving you context sensitive help.

SHEZ also has  a built-in menuing system. To activate the  menu system press the
forward slash key.  A  menu bar will appear at the top of  the screen. Using the
left and  right cursor keys you may select major  menu item. Press the enter key
to view the choices under the menu item.   Using the up and down cursor keys you
may choose  an action item and  then press the  enter key to perform  that item.
Pressing the ESC key will take you back one level.  Keep pressing the ESC key to
exit the menu system.

There are  two functions  that can  only be  activated via  the menuing  system.
Printing  a  file  contained  in  an  archive  file,  and  setting  the  default
compressing factor.  There are no hots keys associated with these functions.

SHEZ will optionally swap 90% of its code out of memory when you:

1)Shell to DOS
2)Execute the edit function.
3)Run a program contained in a compressed file.

This  allows you to  run most programs  from within SHEZ  without running out of
memory.   The  swapping routine was  developed by  Curtis Little and  works very
nicely  as well as being fast.  The default for SHEZ is not to use this swapping
function.   However  this can  be  changed via  the  configuration program.  The
swapping function will swap  as much of SHEZ  as possible out of DOS  memory and
into either  EMS (3.2 or 4.0) memory,  if available, or to  the currently active
default disk.  

PLEASE NOTE:  IF YOU ARE  RUNNING A SYSTEM  WITHOUT A  HARD DISK OR  WITHOUT EMS
MEMORY DO NOT ACTIVATE THIS OPTION.

One  of two mouse menu's will  appear depending upon where you  are in SHEZ.  If
the DOS directory window  in displayed the first  menu will appear,  if  you are
looking at the contents of a compressed file the second menu will appear.

I have had numerous questions on how to allow the mouse to function when viewing
a file via Vern's list program.  In order to allow  the mouse to function within
list you must "CLONE" the mouse option into the list program.  You must be using
LIST PLUS version  7.2 in order  to use the  mouse.  To  clone the mouse  option
change to the  directory that contains the LIST.COM program, then start the LIST
program from the DOS prompt and include the mouse command line option  /M.  I.E.
LIST /M. When the  first screen appears press ALT-C to modify LIST.COM to always
startup with the mouse option.   If you need  further infomation on cloning  the
list program please see the documentation included with LIST.

DOS directory Speed Search
     When  the DOS directory  window is displayed  you may quickly  position the
     highlight bar to a directory or file by pressing a single letter or number.
     You will be positioned to the first directory or file that begins  with the
     pressed  letter or number.   If no  entry begins  with the enter  letter or
     number the  highlight  bar will  be  positioned to  the directory  or  file
     beginning with the next letter or number.  
     On  the first press  of a key  the highlight bar  will move  to a directory
     entry, on  the second press of the same key the highlight bar will be moved
     to a file entry.
     (PLEASE NOTE THAT SPEED  SEARCH ONLY WORKS CORRECTLY WHEN THE  FILE LIST IS
     SORTED BY NAME!!!!)

Extract location - ALT-P
     This option  will prompt you  to enter  a drive and  directory of  where to
     place files  that you extract from the archive.   This location will remain
     in effect  until you enter the ALT-P command again  and clear the drive and
     directory or you  change to another archive file. This command is used when
     you want  to place  extracted files in  a location  other than  the current
     drive and directory.

     If you specify a  directory that does not exist a  ERROR/INFORMATION window
     will appear indicating  that the directory does  not exist.  You  may press
     the F10 key to create the directory.

     This command may be issued at any time.

     When the input window appears pressing the F9 key will open  another window
     which will display a  scrollable list of directories. To display  a list of
     directories other  than  on  the  current drive,  enter  the  drive  letter
     followed by a colon, then  press the F9 key.  Scroll the  list using the up
     and down cursor keys, and press  the ENTER key to select the  directory you
     wish to extract files into.

Create a new archive file - F7
     This option  allows  you to  create a  new compressed  file.   For  further
     information see the section titled, CREATING NEW COMPRESSED FILES, later in
     this document. 

Show help screen - F1
     This  will display a help screen  showing all currently supported commands.
     Any command can be entered while the help screen is displayed.

Temporary exit to DOS - F10

     This  will  temporarily clear  the screen  and  exit to  DOS. You  can then
     execute  and command you want.   To return to SHEZ type  in EXIT at the DOS
     prompt and press return.

Select a new archive file - F2
     This option will prompt you to enter a new disk, directory, and filespec to
     find another archive file to work with.
     If you enter a filespec  of $.$ SHEZ will  only list directory entries  and
     file that have extensions of .ARC, .ZIP, .LZH, PAK, ARJ, and ZOO.

     When the input  window appears pressing the F9 key will open another window
     which will  display a scrollable list of directories.  To display a list of
     directories other  than  on  the  current drive,  enter  the  drive  letter
     followed by a colon, then press the  F9 key.  Scroll the list using the  up
     and down  cursor keys, and press the ENTER  key to select the directory you
     wish to change to.

View a file - F3
     This option will allow you to view any file that is listed in the main file
     window.   Simply highlight the file  you wish to  view by using  the cursor

     may  also press  the  ESC key  to  cancel the  conversion  process.     The
     converted file will be placed into the same directory as the original file,
     and the original file will remain intact.

Convert all tagged files - CTL-V
     This option will convert all tagged files to another archive method. A list
     will appear showing  the available compression  alternatives that SHEZ  has
     been  configured  for.    Using the  mouse  or  cursor  keys  highlight the
     compression method you  wish to convert to,  then press the enter  key. You
     may  also press  the  ESC key  to  cancel  the conversion  process.     The
     converted file will be placed into the same directory as the original file,
     and the original file will remain intact.

Convert highlighted file to a SFX file - F8
     This  option will  convert  the highlighted  compressed  file  into a  Self
     extracting file.
     (Currently only files in the ZIP,LZH, and PAK formats may be converted)

     If you  are converting  a ZIP file  that was  created using version  1.1 of
     PKZIP, SHEZ will  first attempt to create  a MINI Self extracting  file. If
     that fails  than a  normal Self extracting  file will  be created.  See the
     PKZIP documentation for more on MINI self extracting files.

                           NOTES ON CREATING SFX FILES

     To convert a ZIP file to self extracting file the program, ZIP2EXE.EXE, and
     the file PKSFX.PRG, must be in the current directory or in a directory that
     is defined in your PATH.

     When  a PAK  file  is  converted the  PAK  file  is  replaced by  the  self
     extracting  file.   For example:   If  tell SHEZ  to convert  a file  named
     TEST.PAK  in the directory C:\TEST  the TEST.PAK file  will be deleted from
     the  C:\TEST directory and will be replaced  by the file TEST.EXE.  This is
     not a function of SHEZ it is a function of the PAK compression program.

     When an LZH file  is converted to a self extracting  file the LHARC program
     will created either a  .COM file or a  .EXE file, depending on the  size of
     the LZH file.

Convert Tagged files to SFX files - SFT-F8
     This  option will convert all tagged  compressed files into Self extracting
     files.  See the F8 option above for additional information on  creating SFX
     files.

     program. (See Section titled CLONING THE CONFIGURATION).

Copy highlighted file CTL-F2
         This option allows you to copy the highlighted file.  When prompted for
         the location to copy to you may enter the target directory name along
         with an optional filename and extension.  If the filename and extension
         are not supplied SHEZ will use the original filename and extension.
         You may also use the * wildcard character for either the filename
         and/or the extension.  If you use the * character SHEZ will use the
         original filename and/or extension when copying the file.
         I.E. From: = C:\UTILITY\ANY.ZIP
                To: = C:\WORK\NEW.*

         This will create a file named NEW.ZIP in the \WORK directory.

         The new file will have the orginial file's time and date stamp.

Move highlighted file CTL-F3
     This option allows you  to move the highlighted  file.   When prompted  for
     the location to move to you may enter the  target directory name along with
     an optional filename and extension.  If  the filename and extension are not
     supplied SHEZ will use the original filename and extension.
     The moved file name will not be removed from the displayed list. Instead it
     will  be flagged with an  # to the  left of the  filename and a  'm' to the
     right.

Rename highlighted file CTL-F6
     This option allows you to rename the  highlighted file.  You must at  least
     provide a filename and extension. 

Toggle the Tag status - SPACE
     Pressing the  space bar  will toggle  the tagged  status  of the  currently
     highlighted file. A check  mark to the left of the  filename indicates that
     it is tagged.

     As  files are  tagged and untagged  a count  of the number  of files tagged
     along  with the  total size  of all  tagged files  is  updated on  the main
     screen.

Tag All Files - CTL-SPACE

     This option allows you to add/update the file comment records in all tagged
     compressed files.   To  use this  option first  create an  ASCII file  that
     contains the file comments you wish to  add to the compressed files.   Then
     tag  the files you wish to  update, and press the ALT-C  keys.  You will be
     prompted for the ASCII file that contains your comment record(s). SHEZ will
     then  execute  the  appropriate  compressed  file  maintenance  program  to
     add/update the file comments in each tagged compressed file. 

Immediate Exit ALT-Q
     This option will immediately exit SHEZ.

Test tagged compressed file(s) for viruses - ALT-Z
     Using this  option SHEZ interfaces  with the virus  scan program (SCAN.EXE)
     that is produced by McAfee Associates.  You must have version 39 or greater
     of this scan program in order for SHEZ to use it correctly.

     First tag all the compressed files in the directory window that you wish to
     test.   Then press the ALT-Z  keys, or use the drop  down menus.  SHEZ will
     extract all .COM, .EXE, and .OV? files  into its working directory for each
     tagged  compressed  file,  and  will  execute  the  virus  scan program  to
     determine if any  of the program files  have been infected. If  an infected
     program is found SHEZ will temporarily suspend it's processing allowing you
     to see which programs are infected.  You may then press any key to continue
     scanning the  rest of the tagged files.   (See the configuration section of
     this manual for more infomation on configuring SHEZ for this option).

Copy all TAGGED DOS files   - SFT-F2

     are  tagged in the file window.   Please note will be  asked if you want to
     delete the files. Respond  Y if you wish to delete the files, anything else
     will abort the delete. 
     The  deleted,moved  and renamed  files name  will not  be removed  from the
     displayed list. Instead  it will be  flagged with an #  to the left  of the
     filename and a 'd', 'm', or 'r' to the right.

     When copying or moveing files the new files will retain the orginial file's
     time and date stamp.

Display file sizes  -  ALT-S
     The ALT-S  command will  cause the  directory  display to  show file  sizes
     instead of file dates.

Viewing a file - V
     Simply press the return key or the  V key. This will temporarily unpack the
     file and will invoke the LIST program allowing you to view the file on your
     screen.   The temporary copy of  the extracted file  will be placed  in the
     current disk and directory unless you  specified a work disk to be  used by
     using the configuration program.

     Release 4.3 of SHEZ will now allow you to operate on  compressed files that
     are contained  within compressed files.  I.E. A  zip file that contains zip
     files.  To  view the contents of  the embedded compressed file  simply move
     the highlight bar  to the  compressed file and  press the  ENTER key.   The
     embedded compress  file contents will now be displayed  on the screen.  You
     may view any of the files and/or extract  any of the files contained in the
     compressed file.  However you may  not add, delete, or update the  embedded
     compressed file.   

Extracting a single file - E.
     This will extract the file  that is being pointed  to.  The extracted  file
     will  be  placed on  the current  disk  in the  current directory.  You may
     optionally  use the  ALT-P  command  to direct  the  extracted  files to  a
     different disk and/or directory.

Testing archive integrity - T
     This  will test  the integrity  of  the archive  file and  will  report the
     results on the screen.

Display Info about archive file - I
     This  will display  information about the  archive file  in a  small pop-up
     window at  the top of the screen.  The  information will include the number
     of files in the archive,  the date of the newest file in  the archive,  the
     total size of  all the files  in the archive  including the total  expanded
     size and total  compressed size. It will  also display the current  default
     compression factor.

Delete a file from the archive - D
     This will  delete the selected file from the  archive file. Before the file
     is deleted a prompt  will appear asking for verification of  the delete. In
     addition any files that were previously tagged will have the tag cleared. 

Delete a tagged files from an archive - CTL-D

Add file(s) to archive     - A
Update files(s) in archive - U
Move files(s) to archive   - M
Freshen file(s) in archive - F
     Each of these  options will cause a  small window to open at  the bottom of
     the  screen.   The  window  will  prompt  you to  enter  one  or more  file
     specifications. These filespecs  can include  drive, path,  and a  filespec
     with wild cards.   All files matching the indicated filespec will be added,
     updated, moved or freshened in the current archive file depending  on which
     option you  initially picked. Any  files that  were previously tagged  will
     have the tag cleared.

     For example  if you enter a U to update files  in the archive and you enter
     c:\source\*.c   d:\batch\*.c when prompted  to enter  a filespec, than  all
     files on the C  drive in the source directory that have a file extension of
     C,  and  all files  on the  D drive  in  the batch  directory that  have an
     extension of bat, will be updated in the current archive file.

List of files to add to archive     - ALT-A
List of files to freshen in archive - ALT-F
List of files to move to archive    - ALT-M
List of files to update in archive  - ALT-U
     Again each of these options will cause a small window to open at the bottom
     of the  screen.   The window will  prompt you  to enter  a filespec.   This
     filespec can include drive, path, and a filespec with wild cards.  When you
     press the return  key another window  will pop-up on the  left side of  the
     screen showing you all the files that were found that matched  the filespec
     you entered.  You can then  use the cursor  keys to  scroll the file  list.
     Pressing  the space  bar  will  toggle the  tagged  status  of the  current
     highlighted file.  When you are done tagging file  press the return key and
     all files that  you tagged will be  added, freshened, moved, or  updated in
     the current archive file. END GROUP

Specify where to put extracted files - ALT-P 
     This options will  prompt you to  enter a drive  and directory of  where to
     place files  that you extract from the archive.   This location will remain
     in  effect until you enter the ALT-P command  again and clear the drive and
     directory or you  change to another archive file. This command is used when
     you want  to place  extracted files in  a location  other than  the current
     drive and directory.

     If you  specify a directory that does  not exist a ERROR/INFORMATION window
     will appear indicating  that the directory does  not exist.  You  may press
     the F10 key to create the directory.

     This command may be issued at any time.

     directories other  than  on  the  current drive,  enter  the  drive  letter
     followed by  a colon, then press the F9 key.   Scroll the list using the up
     and down cursor keys,  and press the ENTER key to  select the directory you
     wish to extract files into.

Extract all files from archive - ALT-X
     This command will extract all files from the archive file and place them in
     the  current  disk:\directory  unless  you  specified a  different  extract
     location by using the ALT-P command.

Delete all extracted files - ALT-D
     This  command will delete all files  in the current disk:\directory, or the
     one specified by the ALT-P command, that are also contained in  the archive
     file.   The files will only be deleted if the  file time and date are equal
     to or less then the file time  and date of the same file that is  contained
     in the  copressed file. NOTE: it does not  delete anything from the archive
     file.  This is useful when you  extract file from the archive file and then
     you want to quickly delete all the extracted files.

Execute a file in an archive file - R
     This command will execute the EXE or COM file that is currently highlighted
     on the archive file list.   The EXE or COM file will  be extracted from the
     archive  file  and  will be  placed  on  the current  disk  in  the current
     directory.  You will then  be prompted to  enter any optional  command line
     parameters that the program is expecting. The selected program will then be
     executed.  After  the program is  run the extracted  file will be  deleted.
     NOTE: You can specify a different disk drive to place the extracted file on
     by using  the SHEZFG  program.  This  is useful  when working  with archive
     files  that are on floppy disks.  If you specify disk C as the work disk in
     the SHEZFG  program the extracted file will be placed  on the C drive, will
     be executed from the C drive, and then will be deleted from the C drive.

Speed search - ALT-S
     This  option will allow you to quickly find  a file in an archive. A window
     will pop-up asking you to enter  the first letter  or digit of the file you
     wish to find.  The list of files on the screen will then be scrolled to the
     first file that starts with the letter you entered. 

Immediate Exit - ALT-Q
     This option will immediately exit SHEZ.

Extract all tagged files - CTRL-E
     This option will extract all files that you tagged in the archive file.  To
     tag a file simply press the  space bar to toggle the tagged status.  When a

     Any command can be entered while the help screen is displayed.

Temporary exit to DOS - F10
     This will  temporarily  clear the  screen and  exit to  DOS.  You can  then
     execute  and command you want.   To return to SHEZ type  in EXIT at the DOS
     prompt and press return.

Select a new archive file - F2
     This option will prompt you to enter a new disk, directory, and filespec to
     find another archive file to work with.
     If you enter a  filespec of $.$ SHEZ  will only list directory entries  and
     file that have extensions of .ARC, .ZIP, .LZH, .PAK, ARJ, and .ZOO.

Sort the archive file list - F9
     This  option  will  allow  you to  sort  the  archive  file  list by  Name,
     Extension, Date,  or Size.  A small window will  open up asking you how you
     want the list sorted.  Enter a N, E, D, or S. 

Edit the selected file - F8
     This option will extract the selected file onto either the default  disk or
     the work disk specified via the configuration program.  It will then invoke
     the editor  specified via the  configuration program  passing the  selected
     filename.ext to the editor.  When you exit your editor SHEZ will  then MOVE
     the extracted file  back into  the archive,  if it has  been modified,  and
     delete  the extracted  copy.  If an  editor  was not  specified during  the
     configuration process this command will not function.

     the file mask.  The file mask uses the same wild card conventions as DOS.

Toggle overwrite mode - O
     This option toggle  overwrite mode on and off.   When overwrite mode  is in
     effect an  'O' will appear in  the upper right  hand corner of  the screen.
     When overwrite mode is in effect,  and you extract a file from  an archive,
     it will be extracted even if it already exists on the target disk:\path.

Add Update File Comments - ALT-C
     This option allows you to add and/or update the compressed file comments.

Supply Password for File - G
     This option  allows you  to supply a  password when  working with  password
     encrypted files.  The password  will be used when extracting,  viewing, and
     modifying the currently selected compressed file. When a  password has been
     supplied  the compressed file display window  will indicate that a password
     is in effect. 

Set Path/Directory option - P
     Version  4.9 of  SHEZ  now supports  directory names  in  compressed files.
     Initially directory  names are  only supported  in ZIP  and LZH  compressed
     files.  The PAK format will be coming out shortly.  The  small data version
     of  SHEZ will  support  compressed files  that have  seven or  fewer unique
     directory  names,    the large  data  version of  SHEZ  supports  40 unique
     directory  names.  If a file  has been saved into  a compressed file with a
     directory name the  name will appear  on the right  side of the  compressed
     file list.

     Normally  when  you update  or  extract files  from  a compressed  file the
     directory information is ignored.  Using  the 'P' option you can tell  SHEZ
     that you want to save and/or use the directory information.  When you press
     the 'P'  key a list of three options will appear  on the screen.  The first
     option "Do not use  Dir info", tells SHEZ to ignore  directory information.
     The  second  option  "Use  Dir  Info"  tells  SHEZ  to save  the  directory
     information  when updating  a  compressed file,  or  to  use the  directory
     information  when extracting  files.  The  third option, "Use  Dir Info and
     Recurse",  tells  SHEZ  to  save  directory  information  when  updating  a
     compressed file  and to recurse  down the  directory tree when  looking for
     files.  The third option  also tells SHEZ to  use the directory information
     when extracting files.  

     The following options are passed to the compression programs when directory
     information is to be used:

     USE DIR INFO             USE DIR INFO AND RECURSE
     Pkzip -P            Pkzip -Pr

     Please  consult   the  compression  program's  documentation   for  further
     information on what these options do.

View file and archive comment records - ALT-V 
     This  option will display  on the screen  the contents of  the archive file
     along with any comment records that have been placed into the archive file.

Add/Update highlighted archive file comments - s 
     This option will  allow you to add  and/or update comment records  that are
     associated with the highlighted file in the archive.


Add/Update all archive file comments - SHIFT-S 
     This option will  allow you to add  and/or update comment records  that are
     associated with the each file in the archive.

Convert SFX file - CTL-V
     This option will convert a self  extracting compressed file (.COM or  .EXE)
     back to  a normal  compressed file.   The  normal compressed  file will  be
     placed on the same disk and in the same directory when  the self extracting
     is located.  The self extracting file will remain intact.  Please note that
     this option is only available  when you are viewing the contents  of a self
     extracting file. For  a list the the self extracting file  that can be read
     my SHEZ see the section titled SELF EXTRACTING FILE SUPPORT.

Test COM,EXE, and OVL files in a compressed file for viruses -ALT-Z
     Using this  option SHEZ interfaces  with the virus  scan program (SCAN.EXE)
     that is produced by McAfee Associates.  You must have version 39 or greater
     of this scan program in order for SHEZ to use it.  When you press the ALT-Z
     key SHEZ  will extract  all .COM,  .EXE, and  .OV? files  into its  working
     directory and will  execute the virus scan  program to determine if  any of
     the program  files have been  infected. (See  the configuration section  of
     this manual for more infomation on configuring SHEZ for this option).

Extract only newer files - ALT-N
     The ALT-N command will only extract  files contained in the compressed file
     that are newer than the files that are contained in the extract directory.

Alternate file viewers - CTL-ENTER
     Pressing the  CTL-ENTER  command  will  allow you  to  view  the  currently
     highlighted file using a user specified alternate file viewer.

Show tagged file count - SHIFT-KEY
     Pressing the  SHIFT key will toggle the function  key line to show you, the
     number of files tagged, total compressed file size,  and total uncompressed
     file size.   If the compressed files you are working  with is a ZIP file it
     will also  show you the  size of the ZIP  file that will be  created if you
     build a new ZIP files containing all of the tagged files.  Please note this
     is only an estimate and does not take into account file comment records and
     it assumes  that the compression  method will be  the same as  is currently
     used.  

Toggle authenticity mode in PKZIP - ALT-1
     Pressing the ALT-1 keys will toggle the authenticity mode when using PKZIP.
     If the authenticity mode is active an ! will appear  on the heading line to
     the right of the NAME heading field.

Copy tagged members to another compressed file - CTL-Y
     The CTL-Y command  allows you to copy selected members of a compressed file
     to  another  compressed file.    The  target  compressed  file can  be  any
     currently supported  compressed file format.   To  perform the copy,  first
     open  up the compressed file you  wish to copy FROM.   Then using the space
     bar tag the files you  wish to copy.  Next press the CTL-Y  keys.  A window
     will appear asking  you to enter  the FULL path  of the compressed  file to
     want to copy the selected members into.   You may enter only a DRIVE:\PATH\
     (note ending backslash) and press the F9 key to obtain a listing of file in
     the entered directory, or you may enter the complete filespec of the target
     compressed file.   You  may also  press the F9  key as  soon as  the window
     appear to obtain a  list of files in the  current directory.  Pressing  the
     enter will then  perform the copy  operation.  The  files that were  tagged
     will remain tagged after the copy operation has been performed allowing you
     to do a CTL-D (delete all tagged files) if desired.  
     If the file you wish to  copy to does not exist a window will appear asking
     if you want to create a new compressed file.  Press  the F10 key to created
     a new file, Press any other key to re-enter the name of the compressed file
     to copy to.

Tag highlighted file - (Plus key +)
     Pressing the + key will tag the highlighted file and move the highlight bar
     down one line.

Untag highlighted file - (Minus key -)
     Pressing the -  key will untag the hightlighted file and move the highlight
     bar down one line.

Exit SHEZ - ESC

Exit SHEZ goto EXTRACT dir - CTL-X
     Pressing the CTL-X key will immediately  exit SHEZ and will place you  into
     the EXTRACT disk and directory.

SHEZ allows you to create new compressed files either from the directory display
window, using the F7 key,  or from the compressed file display window  using the
'C' command. 

A window will appear  asking you to enter the drive, directory,  and name of the
compressed  file  to  be  created.     YOU  MUST  ENTER  A  FILE  EXTENSION   OF
.ZIP,.ARC,.LZH,.ZOO,ARJ,or .PAK  SO SHEZ KNOWS  WHAT TYPE OF  COMPRESSED FILE TO
CREATE!!!!!  Then you will asked if  you want to add or  move files into the new
archive  file.  You will also  be asked to enter an  optional password.  (If you
enter a password all files added or  moved to the archive file will be encrypted
using the password. Do  not forget the password  you can not extract  files from
the file without the  password and there is no way to  determine the password if
you  forget it.)    Please note  the  password prompt  will only  appear  if the
compression program used to create the new file support encryption.

A window will  then be opened that  will ask you  to enter the filespecs  of the
files you  wish to  add or  move into the  new archive  file. This  filespec can
include a disk, directory, and file specifications with wild cards. 

A third window will  be opened allowing you to specify processing  options.  The
first option "Do you want to Tag files or Process as is" allows you to tell SHEZ
that you want  to Tag files  for processing using  the filespecs entered in  the
second  window, or  to  simply pass  the  entered filespecs  to the  compression
program exactly as entered.   The second option  "Do you want to  save directory
information" allows you to tell  SHEZ that you want directory  information saved
in the  compressed file.  The third option  "Do you want to recurse directories"
will tell  the compression program  to add/move all  files in the  directory you
specified plus all directories that exist beneath it.

If you  indicated that you wanted to Tag files for processing a window will pop-
up on the  left side of the  screen showing all files that  matched the filespec
you entered.  Tag the  files you wish to add or move to  the new compressed file
by pressing the space bar.  When you are done tagging  file press the return key
and all tagged files will be added or moved into the new archive file.

Please note  that  some  of these  options  may not  appear  when you  create  a
compressed file.   If  the compression program  you are  using does  not support
saving directory information the directory information prompts will not appear.

Shez has the ability to convert one, or a group of tagged files, from one format
to another.  First you must get the file  or files you want to convert to appear
in  the filelist window on the left  side of the screen.   The easiest way to do
this is to start up  SHEZ and specify on the command line  either *.*, *.ZIP, or

*.ARC.  Then using  the cursor keys highlight the  file you want to convert  and
then press  the ALT-V key  to convert the  file. You will  then be asked,  via a
menu, what archive format you want to convert to.  Position the highlight bar to
the type of compressed file you wish to convert to and press the enter key.  You
will also be asked if you want  to delete the original file after the conversion
has been successfully completed.  Respond Y or N. The new file will be placed on
the same disk and directory that the original file was on.

To convert numerous  files start up  SHEZ as  above and use  the cursor keys  to
highlight the  files you want to convert, then press  the space bar to TAG these
files.   After  all files have  been tagged  press CTRL-V to  convert all TAGGED
files.

Release 4.4 of SHEZ will support version 1.0 of PKZIP.   To use the new features
of  version 1.0 of  PKZIP you MUST  run the configuration  program, SHEZCFG, and
specify that you are using version 1.0 of PKZIP.

SHEZ will  allow you  to easily  convert your  old ZIP  files into  the new  ZIP
imploded format.  Simply tag the ZIP  files you want to convert and specify that
you want to convert them to ZIP files.  You will be asked if  you want to delete
the old compressed files after the conversion process.  SHEZ is smart enough not
to delete the old compressed file if the have the same file extension as the new
files.   I.E. when you convert a ZIP file to a ZIP file to take advantage of the
new compression format SHEZ will not delete the converted ZIP files  even if you
told it to delete the old compressed files after converting them.

SHEZ will also  allow you to convert  old LZH files  to the new LHA  2.05 format
using the same method of converting a file to itself.

Beginning with release  4.7 of SHEZ, SHEZ can  now let you view  the contents of
self  extracting  files.    Files  that  have  been  created  by  the  following
compression programs are supported:

PKARC, PKPAK, PKZIP  version .92  thru 1.1,  LHARC version 1.12  thru 2.05,  PAK
version 1.6 thru 2.01, ARC5 and ARC6, ARJ version 1.00.

When you  display the contents  of a self extracting  file SHEZ will  attempt to
identify which  compression program  was used  to generate  the self  extracting
file.  SHEZ will place the name  of the compression program it has identified as
the creator, on the heading line right next to the column titled NAME.

In addition  to viewing  the contents  of a  self extracting  file you may  also
extract individual files using SHEZ's extract command.  You may also convert the
self extracting file back to a  normal compressed file using the CTL-V  command,
or using the pull down menus.

You  can not alter  the contents of  a self  extracting file. I.E.  add, update,
freshen, move, etc.  The  exception to this are  self extracting files built  by
PKZIP.  These files  you can treat like normal  compressed files.  You can  add,
update, move, delete, freshen, etc.

SHEZ will recognize the following environment variables if they are set:

BIOS      This will force SHEZ to use  BIOS for writing to the screen.  MONOThis
          will force SHEZ to run in monochrome mode.
SHEZEX    You can set this variable to the disk and path where you  want SHEZ to
          write extracted  file to. You  can reset this  default at any  time by
          using the ALT-P command.
SHEZWORK
  This variable may be used to  specify a working directory for SHEZ  to
          use instead of SHEZ buliding one of  it's own.  This directory must be
          for the  exclusive of  SHEZ, and must  exist prior  to invoking  SHEZ.
          WHEN  SHEZ TERMINATES  ALL  FILES IN  THE DIRECTORY  WILL  BE DELETED,
          INCLUDING  HIDDEN AND  SYSTEM  FILES, BUT  THE DIRECTORY  WILL  NOT BE
          DELETED.  This option was added to allow more flexibility when running
          SHEZ on a LAN based system.

SHEZCMT
   This  variable may  be set  to  specify a  default  comment file  when
          adding/updating compressed file  comment records to a group  of tagged
          files.

SHEZCFG

          This variable points to the SHEZ.CFG  file that is created by pressing
          the ALT-W keys.   It is used  to carry forward,  or override the  SHEZ
          configuration options.
          (See  the section  titled CLONING THE  CONFIGURATION OPTIONS  for more
          information.

Examples:
SET BIOS=Y
SET MONO=Y
SET SHEZEX=D:\WORK
SET SHEZWORK=C:\SHEZXX\
SET SHEZCMT=C:\COMMENT.DAT
SET SHEZCFG=C:\DATA\SHEZ.CFG

(This tells  SHEZ  to  write extracted  files  onto  the D  disk  in  the  \work
directory.  You can  change this at any  time after executing SHEZ by  using the
ALT-P command.)

The  environment  variables  BIOS  and MONO  will  override  the  BIOS  and MONO
parameters that were entered via the configuration program.

Shez has the capability  to activate user specified alternate file  viewers when
the CTL-ENTER key  is pressed.   The  alternate file viewers  are specified  via
environment  variables.  The "generic" alternate  file viewer is specified using
the environment variable named SHEZEV, and "specific" alternate file viewers are
specified  using environment  variables  named SHEZEV.XXX  where XXX  is  a file
extension.

For example:

SET SHEZEV=C:\UTY\FVIEW $F /43
SET SHEZEV.GIF=VGIF $F /VGA
SET SHEZEV.PIC=VPIC $F /P

The  first set  command tells SHEZ  the generic  file viewer  is located  in the
C:\UTY directory and is called FVIEW.  The $F tells SHEZ where to place the name
of the file to view and the /43 is a parameter to pass to the FVIEW program.

The second set command tells  SHEZ, when using the alternate file viewer to view
files  with a file extension of GIF, run the VGIF program, which is located in a
directory in the PATH, pass it  a parameter of /VGA, and the $F tells SHEZ where
to place the name of the file to view.

The third set command tells SHEZ which alternate file viewer to use when viewing
files with an extension of .PIC.

Any  number  of specific  file  viewers may  be  specified.   When  CTL-ENTER is
pressed,  SHEZ first looks to  see of a specific  alternate file viewer has been
defined for  viewing files  with a file  extension the  same of  the highlighted
file.  If one  was defined it is activated  and used.  If a specific  viewer has
not been defined SHEZ then determines  if a "generic" alternate file viewer  has
been defined. If it has SHEZ uses the "generic" viewer.   If no alternate viewer
has  been defined SHEZ than defaults to  using the normal viewer as defined when
the SHEZCFG program was used to configure SHEZ.

PLEASE NOTE: WHEN  SHEZ ACTIVATES ANY ALTERNATE  FILE VIEWER IT ALWAYS  USES ITS
PAGING LOGIC TO  SWAP MOST OF ITS  CODE OUT OF MEMORY  TO GIVE MORE ROOM  TO THE
ALTERNATE   FILE  VIEWER.     THIS   IS  NOT   A  CONFIGURABLE   OPTION  SO   BE

Release 5.5 of the SHEZCFG program now requires that you enter the  full path of
the SHEZ.EXE program you wish to configure.  This has been done since some users
are running multiple copies of SHEZ configured differently.

Beginning with release 5.4 of SHEZ, the configuration program will now allow you
to install the serial number you receive from CSD when you register your version
of  SHEZ.    Installing the  serial  number  "unlocks" SHEZ  and  allows  you to
configure SHEZ to handle more files per  directory and per compressed file.  The
5.4 version of the SHEZCFG program will also allow you to  pass optional command
line arguments to the editor that you tell SHEZ to invoke.

The SHEZCFG  program directly modifies  the SHEZ.EXE program.  The configuration
program  SHEZCFG and the SHEZ program  now come as a matched  set.  YOU MUST USE
THE CORRECT CONFIGURATION PROGRAM OR YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CUSTOMIZE SHEZ.

The configuration program will  present you with an initial menu.   Enter one of
the highlighted  letters  that appears  on  the menu  to set  the  configuration
parameters that  fall under the  indicated category. New  items that can  be set
during configuration are:

1) Use the BIOS for screen writing.
2) Indicate if you are using a Monochrome monitor.
3) Set default ZIP compression factors.
4) Enter  a full  Disk:\Directory name  for all  externally called  programs.   
(I.E. PKZIP, PKUNZIP, LIST, etc.)
5) Indicate if you want exploding windows or not.

The configuration program will allow you to modify SHEZ'S default color setting,
tell  SHEZ  the name  of  the archive  programs,  the name  of  extract program,
customize the number  of files per archive  file SHEZ can handle,  customize the
number of files per  directory SHEZ can handle, specify a work  disk to use when
viewing and executing file from an archive file, and other misc. parameters.

When you start up  SHEZ it records the current disk and directory. When you view
or  execute a file from an archive file  SHEZ temporarily extracts the file onto
the current  disk and directory. This works fine as  long as the current disk is
your hard disk. However if your current disk is a floppy and there is not enough
room on  the floppy to build the extracted file than  SHEZ will not let you view
or execute the file.  To get around this use  the configuration program and when
the prompt:

ENTER WORK DISK DRIVE LETTER TO USE WHEN VIEWING/RUNNING FILE->

appears enter the disk drive letter  of your hard disk or of your  second floppy
disk drive.  SHEZ  will then use this disk to build  the temporary extract files

and will delete them when you are finished viewing or running the selected  file
from the archive.

When running under  EGA or VGA  you can tell  SHEZ to go into  43 line mode  for
EGA'S, and  43 or 50  line mode for VGA's.   This is done  via the configuration
program.

You may tell SHEZ the files to search for when you  use the wildcard filespec of
$.$.   The configuration  program will  ask you to  enter the  file extension to
search  for   when  you   enter  a   filespec  of   $.$.     The  defaults   are
.ARC,.ZIP,.LZH,.ZOO,.ARJ,.PAK.   If you wish to  modify these defaults enter the
extensions, along  with the preceding  dot, and  separate each extension  with a
comma.

A new  configuration option is present beginning with  release 4.1 of SHEZ.  The
option will allow you indicate to the compression programs the disk drive to use
to build temporary working  copies of the  compressed files.   If you are  using
PKZIP and/or  PKPAK,  PKARC, the  disk  drive letter  will  be passed  to  these
programs by using  the -b program  option.  If  you are using  LHARC it will  be
passed to  LHARC  by using  the  /w switch.   Please  refer  to the  compression
program's documentation for further information.

If you are using a  monochrome monitor and you wish to alter  the default screen
attributes follow the procedure below or your attribute settings may be lost.

1)When  the main configuration  panel is displayed  choose either the  Black and
White color set, or the Monochrome set as a starting point.

2)Then choose the  Custom color set option to customize the screen attributes as
you see fit.

3)Choose  any other configuration options after you are done modifying the color
set.

4)Save the configuration information.

In version 4.4 of SHEZ you may now configure SHEZ to display the directory where
extracted files will  be placed.  This  option may be set via  the configuration
program.  If this option is activated the  extract location will be displayed on
the top line of the screen when you are viewing the contents of an archive file.

Beginning  with version  4.9  of SHEZ  you may  now configure  SHEZ to  sort the
contents of a compressed file when it is initially displayed on the screen.  You
may sort the compressed file list by Filename, File-extension, or by File-Date.

Configuring for Virus Scanning

Under the program options,  you will be asked if  you wish to configure SHEZ  to
scan .COM  and .EXE  files contained  in compressed  files for  viruses. If  you
respond Y, SHEZ will that ask you where the virus checking program can be found.
The program that  SHEZ supports is SCAN.EXE  version 39 or greater,  produced by
McAfee     Associates.          When     prompted     enter     the     complete
DISK:\DIRECTORY\FILENAME.EXT of  where the SCAN.EXE  is located.   It is advised
that you please the SCAN program on a write protected floppy disk to prevent  it
from  being infected.  PLEASE NOTE: SHEZ WILL  NOT SEARCH YOUR PATH FOR THE SCAN
PROGRAM.  IF YOU DO NOT TELL  IT EXACTLY WHERE TO FIND IT SHEZ WILL BE UNABLE TO
EXECUTE THE PROGRAM.

As an added precaution the SHEZCFG program can now check the SHEZ program to see
if it has  been illegally altered.   This function will  only work with  version
4.91 and  greater of the  SHEZCFG program, and  version 4.91 and  greater of the
SHEZ program.  (Small or Large data version).   To use this function startup the
SHEZCFG program  and pick the  item on the  menu titled "Integrity check".   The
SHEZCFG program  will  proceed to  verify that  the SHEZ  program  has not  been
altered.   PLEASE NOTE  THAT THIS  CHECK MAY  BE PERFORMED  EVEN AFTER  YOU HAVE
RECONFIGURED SHEZ.   The verification  procedure uses  to 16 bit  CRC values  to
check the integrity.  If the calculated CRC's do not  match the values stored in
SHEZ a  message  will appear  indicating  that the  integrity  of SHEZ  as  been
compromised.

Beginning with release 3.7  of SHEZ there is an option that  allows you to write
out  a configuration  file (SHEZ.CFG)  that will  be  used by  the configuration
program,  SHEZCFG,  to copy  your  configuration information  from  your current
version of SHEZ to the next version of SHEZ. To perform the cloning operation do
the following steps:

1.   Start up the SHEZ program with no parameters.
2.   When the file list window appears press the ALT-W keys. This will write out
     the current SHEZ configuration information into a file  named SHEZ.CFG onto
     the current disk and directory.
3.   Unpack all files from  the new version of SHEZ onto  the disk and directory
     where the SHEZ.CFG file exists.
4.   Rename the old SHEZ.EXE program file to SHEZ.OLD 
5.   Run the SHEZCFG program.
6.   You  will  be asked  the name  of  the program  to modify,  the  default is
     SHEZ.EXE.  Press the enter  key and the following  message should appear at
     the top of the screen:
     CONFIGURATION INFORMATION FROM FILE SHEZ.CFG BEING USED 
7.   Press the enter key to display the configuration menu. 
8.   Select the Save configuration information option, and your new copy of SHEZ
     will be updated with your old configuration information. 
9.   Delete the SHEZ.CFG file.

Please note when you clone the configuration  options the serial number that was
previously installed is lost!!  After cloning  the configuration option you must
reinstall your serial number if one was previously installed!!! 

Beginning with release 5.8 of SHEZ  there is another method of carrying  forward
the configuration  options  from one  version  to another.    By using  the  new
environment  variable named  30SHEZCFG to  point to  the SHEZ.CFG  file that  is
created when using the ALT-W command sequence. 

If you already have a configured version of SHEZ skip to step xx.

1.   First run the SHEZCFG program and configure SHEZ to your personal tastes.
2.   Be sure to save your options by choosing the Save configuration information
     off the SHEZCFG program menu.
3.   Start up the SHEZ program with no parameters. 
4.   When  the  file list  window  appear press  the  ALT-W keys  to  create the
     SHEZ.CFG file.
5.   Copy the SHEZ.CFG file onto the Disk and directory of your choosing. 
6.   In you autoexec.bat file insert the following line:

SET SHEZCFG=C:\DATA\SHEZ.CFG

Substitute C:\DATA\SHEZ.CFG  with the disk  and directory  where you copied  the
SHEZ.CFG to.

7.   Now when  you start-up SHEZ,  it will  read it's configuration  information
     from  the file name identified by  the SHEZCFG environment variable instead
     using the configuration information stored inside SHEZ itself.

PLEASE  NOTE  THAT  WHEN  YOU  USE  THIS  METHOD  THE CONFIGURATION  INFORMATION
CONTAINED IN THE FILE POINTED TO BY THE SHEZCFG ENVIRONMENT  VARIABLE COMPLETELY
OVERRIDES THE CONFIGURATION INFORMATION STORED INSIDE SHEZ.

SHEZ  achieves fast screen updates buy  writing directly to video buffer memory.
If your machine is not  100% compatible you can force SHEZ to  use BIOS routines
to update the screen.  This  is accomplished by setting an environment  variable
BIOS equal to Y. I.E. SET BIOS=Y. Do this before executing SHEZ.

For monochrome  monitors  a  similar  method is  employed  set  the  environment
variable MONO equal to Y.  I.E.  SET MONO=Y.

Some clone machines have a bug in the builtin BIOS routines that will cause SHEZ
to hang if  you have exploding windows turned  on.  If you  experience a machine
lock up, try reconfiguring SHEZ and turn the exploding windows off.
