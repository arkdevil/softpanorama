v6.0c  3/12/90 Added full support for LHA205, LHA210,  and LHA211, including all
       header levels.
       When  creating SFX file from LZH files the directory info in the LZH file
       will be retained in the SFX file.
       User can  now configure  SHEZ to  use it's  memory swapping  feature when
       executing compression programs.  When  this feature is activated the  DOS
       window will be temporarily disabled.
       When  the DOS directory window  is displayed the  size of the highlighted
       file is now show at the bottom of the directory window.
       When using the  CTL-Y command to copy member of  one compressed file into
       another compressed  file, the user now  has the option of  creating a new
       compressed file if the target file does not exist.

v6.0b  2/24/90 Misc. bug fixes.

v6.0   2/22/90 The  CFG program will  now allow  you to optionally  use extended
       background colors
       When editing  a file SHEZ will now  only save the editted  file back into
       the compressed file if the file has been modified.
       The CFG program will no longer reset the serial number when reconfiguring
       SHEZ.
       The  CFG  program  will  now  also  allow   you  to  update  an  external
       configuration file if one is found.
       The default  extract path can now  be set and saved  in the configuration
       information.
       The CFG  program will now  allow you  to set the  function key  highlight
       colors.
       Most single letter prompts no longer  require the user to press the enter
       key.
       When the main DOS file list is sorted, directories will  always appear at
       the top of the list.
       When  using the  speed search  option on  the DOS  file list,  pressing a
       letter or a number will  position you first to a directory  name, then if
       the same letter or number is pressed again you will be positioned to  the
       first matching file.
       When entering a filespec without directory information, SHEZ will default
       to the current default directory for the specified or default drive.
       The file times is now displayed in  the DOS directory window, and is used
       when sorting the list by date.
       Support was added for LZH compression method 2.05.
       Support was  added to convert an LZH file from the old compression method
       to  the new  compression method  by  simply converting  the  LZH file  to

                                                                          Page 1

       itself.
       (NOTE: LEVEL 2 HEADERS FOR LHA  2.05 IS NOT SUPPORTED IN THIS  VERSION OF
       SHEZ)
       Support was added for the ARJ compression method.

v5.9   11/9/90 When  extracting  from a  ZIP  file that  has been  created  with
       authenticity  mode SHEZ will  pause allowing you  to see the authenticity
       message.
       When tagging files  on the main  screen then pressing  ALT-Z to scan  for
       viruses,  the  tag  count is  incorrect--fixed.  Added  command  CTL-X to
       immediately exit SHEZ and goto the extract path.
       SHEZ is now DESQview aware.
       SHEZ will now operate on files that are contained in Hidden directories.
       When renaming  individual  files the  TO:  prompt  will now  contain  the
       orginial filename, including disk and directory, to be renamed.
       Sorting  the main  file list  by name  will now  also sort  the directory
       names. In addition when the file list  is sorted by name you can use  the
       speed search facility to position the highlight bar to a directory.
       When invoking an  editor from the main file list the screen was not being
       restored correctly--fixed.
       When  running  PKZIP  in  authentic  mode  SHEZ  will  exclude  the  file
       AVEXTRA.TXT.

v5.8   10/02/90 Pressing the ESC key will eventually exit SHEZ. The authenticity
       warning message now appears in the same color as the help screen.
       The ALT-E command was added on the main file window to invoke  the editor
       on the highlighted file.
       The  Plus + and  Minus -  keys can be  used to  tag and untag  files. The
       environment variable  SHEZCFG can now be  used to tell SHEZ  to read it's
       configuration information from a configuration file.
       When  tagged files that  where contained in  a secondary compressed file,
       the  tags remained when  reverting back to  the orginial compressed file.
       (This bug has been fixed) Support for PAK release 2.5 has been added.

v5.7   07/25/90 Allow ALT-1 to function when the file list window is displayed.
       Fixed a problem with the copy file function.
       Fixed the  configuration program  allowing users  to  install the  serial
       number.
       Corrected  a bug when  attempting to  look at  compressed files  that are
       contained within compressed files.
