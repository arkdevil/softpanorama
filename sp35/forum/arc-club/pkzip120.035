
                   False PKZIP 1.20 !
                   ------------------

   Some slimeball has taken the extremely popular PKZIP program and released
a hacked version of it. If you see any BBS that has a PKZIP 1.20 available
for download, warn the sysop; it's fake!.
   As far as i can tell from disassembling it, it's harmless, but you never
can tell. Phil Katz has confirmed that the program is fake and has stated
that the next official version will be 1.30, to avoid confusion.
