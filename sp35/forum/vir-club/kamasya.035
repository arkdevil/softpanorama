I have been flooded with replies to my question about the text found
inside the Kamasya virus

        Kamasya nendriya pritir
        labho jiveta yavata
        jivasya tattva jijnasa
        nartho yas ceha karmabhih

I would like to thank all those providing a part translation or a part
of it, in particular Rajesh Gupta, Sibabrata Ray, Anupam Joshi, Ajit
Sanzgiri, A. Satish Pai, Girish Chandram,

Everybody agreed it was difficult to translate this text in Sanskrit
into English, but the meaning is something like:

  "As long as you live, sex and pleasing of the senses is useless.
   The essence of life is the desire to know, not money or fame."

This text is surely the most curious I have found inside any of the 400+
viruses I have examined...
