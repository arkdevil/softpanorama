If you look up the FILVIR-2.TXT that came with the FPROT package, you
will see that they are all variants of the same family, albeit quite
different.

Naming conventions have been a difficulty for a ong time, especially
since so many viri are modifications of others.

Q - How many virus writers does it take to change a lightbulb?
A - 17.  One to change the bulb, and an average of 16 to watch him do it,
and then all try it again a slightly different way ...
