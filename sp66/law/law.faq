1.  INTRODUCTION TO "THE LEGAL LIST"
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1.  PURPOSE AND HISTORY.  The purpose of "The Legal List" is to 
provide a consolidated list of all of the law-related resources 
available on the Internet and elsewhere.  I have been "on the 
Internet" since 1984.  I initially learned about the Internet by 
looking over the shoulders of my friends and co-workers (I believe 
that this is the way most people learn how to navigate the 
Internet), and then I began exploring the Internet for myself.  I 
spent a great deal of 1992 exploring the Internet in search of law-
related resources, because I wanted to know what law-related 
resources were available on the Internet.  I was frustrated that of 
comprehensive list of such resources did not exist, so I created my 
own list.  As I discussed what I had been doing with others, they 
began to request copies of my list.  In August, 1992, I released the 
first version.  I called this version "beta.4," because it was (and 
is) a work in progress.

     I am committed to providing high-quality information.  As such, 
I try to verify information.  (If I have not been able to verify a 
resource, I have flagged it in the text with the "***" symbol.)  I 
also include resources that are no longer available, so that you 
won't waste your time responding to a so-called "new" resource that 
has, in fact, been extinct for some time.  What started a relatively 
short list for my own use has grown into the relatively large book 
you are now reading.  Administrative support in the form of a GOPHER 
server (and its disk space) is provided by the University of Maine 
School of Law.  Administrative support in the form of publicity 
within the University of Maine School of Law is provided by the 
Maine Law and Technology Association.  Administrative support in the 
form of an anonymous FTP server (and its disk space) is provided by 
Midnight Networks, Inc.

     Unfortunately, providing high-quality information costs money.  
"The Legal List" receives no financial support from any 
organization.  I have invested my own time and money (mostly due to 
the long-distance phone calls I make to access the Internet) into 
"The Legal List."  As the copyright notice for this version 
indicates, "The Legal List" is free on the Internet, but it costs if 
you print it.  I believe that this arrangement is consistent with 
the spirit of providing free information on the Internet, while at 
the same time allowing me to partially recover the costs of 
producing "The Legal List."  For those who complain that this 
arrangement makes those without Internet access subsidize those with 
such access, I respond that 1) this encourages people to get on the 
Internet to get the free version, 2) I cannot think of a better 
solution, and 3) I do not maintain a paper copy of "The Legal List."

     I believe that "The Legal List" is worth the price.  It is 
comprehensive, frequently-updated, and "subscribeable"  by sending a 
message to legal-list-request@justice.eliot.me.us with "subscribe 
your_name" as the subject)   To date, over 400 individuals from 
approximately 50 universities and 10 countries have subscribed.  But 
don't take my word for it, listen to what others have said:

     "I can't wait to explore this list further." 
     - 06/28/93

     "I am very new to the internet (and to computers in general) 
     but I am delighted by the quality of information I am 
     receiving."
     - 06/29/93

     "Thanks for recently sending the Legal List.  It's a marvelous 
     service."
     - 07/02/93

     "I've just received a copy of The Legal List Version 2.0 and I 
     wanted to congratulate you on a fine piece of work.  It is a 
     great document and should be extremely useful to those of us 
     trying to find our way around the legal side of Internet."
     - 09/07/93

     "Wow - the Legal List is way impressive!"
     - 09/22/93

     "[A] quick note of praise on your Legal List.  I think it's a 
     great idea, and I have found it useful to get a feel for what's
     available online in the legal domain."
     - 09/23/93

     "I had the pleasure of reading your 'Legal List' this morning.  
     I am an attorney and am new to the Internet.  Your paper will 
     prove to be a tremendous research tool for me."
     - 01/06/94

(For those who might be wondering why I am plugging my book in my 
book, let me explain.  The top portion of "The Legal List" (the 
table of contents and Sections 0, 1, and 2) are included as the 
README file that is archived with "The Legal List" and that is 
sent to those inquiring about "The Legal List.")

     Version 3.0 of "The Legal List" has been totally reorganized.  
I have listed the resources in order of ease-of-accessibility.  The 
resources that are easiest to access are listed first, those that 
are more difficult to access are listed last.  For example, the user 
of a value-added network (such as CompuServe, GEnie, or America 
Online) may have access to Internet e-mail but may not have FTP or 
TELNET access.  To this user, the e-mail servers are the most 
useful.  Also, I have tried to list free services before paid 
services.  Finally, I have included two appendices of general 
Internet information that is not necessarily law-related.  The 
following is a summary of the contents of "The Legal List":

     Chapter 0.  REVISION HISTORY ETC.  Self-explanatory.

     Chapter 1.  INTRODUCTION TO "THE LEGAL LIST."  Self-
explanatory.

     Chapter 2.  GETTING AND REDISTRIBUTING "THE LEGAL LIST."  This 
chapter describes how to get "The Legal List."  If you are trying to 
get a copy of "The Legal List," you can avoid many problems by 
simply reading and following the directions.  This is true not only 
of "The Legal List" but also of all of the resources it describes.  
(For example, you may get "The Legal List" via anonymous FTP from 
ftp.midnight.com as pub/LegalList/legallist.txt, but you may NOT 
TELNET to this site.  See Section 2.3 for details.) 

     Chapter 3.  E-MAIL-ACCESSIBLE RESOURCES.  This chapter 
describes law-related resources available via e-mail such as e-mail 
addresses of law-related organizations, e-mail addresses of US law 
schools, and subscription information for subject-oriented law-
related mailing lists.   These mailing lists (many of which are 
LISTSERV groups) are like magazines in that one can subscribe and 
unsubscribe.  There are groups for a wide range of law-related 
interests such intellectual property (CNI-COPYRIGHT), fathers' 
rights (FREE-L), and issues of interest to law students (LAWSCH-L).

     Chapter 4.  FTP-ACCESSIBLE RESOURCES.  This chapter describes 
law-related resources available via anonymous File Transfer Protocol 
(FTP) such as US Supreme Court decisions and Tufts University's 
Multilaterals Project.

     Chapter 5.  TELNET-ACCESSIBLE RESOURCES.  This chapter 
describes law-related resources available via TELNET such as the 
Library of Congress and the archives of Cornell University School of 
Law.

     Chapter 6.  GOPHER-ACCESSIBLE RESOURCES.  This chapter 
describes law-related resources available via GOPHER (an Internet 
client/server protocol, developed in April 1991 by the University of 
Minnesota) such as the archives of Washington and Lee University 
School of Law.  

     Chapter 7.  WWW-ACCESSIBLE RESOURCES.  This chapter describes 
law-related resources available via the World Wide Web (WWW) (a 
distributed hypermedia system started by CERN, the European 
Laboratory for Particle Physics).

     Chapter 8.  WAIS-ACCESSIBLE RESOURCES.  This chapter describes 
law-related resources available via the Wide Area Information 
Servers (WAIS) (a networked full text information retrieval system 
developed by Thinking Machines, Apple Computer, and Dow Jones).

     Chapter 9.  USENET (NETNEWS) NEWSGROUPS.  This chapter lists 
law-related newsgroups available on USENET, the news network that is 
intertwined with, but independent from, the Internet.

     Chapter 10.  BBS-ACCESSIBLE RESOURCES.  This chapter describes 
law-related Bulletin Board Systems/Services (BBSs) such as FedWorld, 
a bulletin board set up by the National Technical Information 
Service (NTIS) that connects to over 100 Federal bulletin boards.  
Many Bulletin Board Systems/Services (BBS) of a legal nature exist, 
including private BBSs, commercial BBSs, and Government BBSs.

     Chapter 11.  COMPUTER-AIDED LEGAL RESEARCH RESOURCES.  This 
chapter describes computer-aided legal research, such as how to 
connect to Lexis/Nexis and WestLaw via TELNET.

     Chapter 12.  JOURNALS.  This chapter lists technology-related 
law-related journals such as "E Law," which is an electronically-
available journal.

     Appendix A.  INTERNET, UUCP, AND USENET INFORMATION.  This 
appendix contains, for example, information on how to get on the 
Internet, i.e.. how to purchase an Internet account.

     Appendix B.  OTHER RESOURCES.  This appendix describes, for 
example, introductory Internet books and shareware software.

1.3.  FOR NEW INTERNET USERS - A BRIEF PRIMER ON THE INTERNET.  
Earlier versions of "The Legal List" stated that "[a] certain level 
of familiarity with the Internet is assumed by the author of 'The 
Legal List.'"  I no longer make this assumption, as I have 
discovered that many readers of "The Legal List" are unfamiliar with 
the Internet in general.  As such, I have added this "brief primer."

     A Brief Primer on the Internet.  The Internet is THE 
international network of computer networks.  Each computer on the 
Internet speaks the same language, the TCP/IP protocols.  (In 
addition, many value-added services such as CompuServe and GEnie are 
connected to the Internet via gateways.  In essence, this means that 
the users of these value-added networks can use limited Internet 
resources, most notably electronic mail.  But this is rapidly 
changing, as these value-added networks make other Internet 
protocols available, such as FTP and telnet.)  The computers on the 
Internet are connected, essentially, by various types of telephone 
lines.  But what matters to the Internet-user is not how these 
computers are connected or how an electronic mail (e-mail) message 
gets from Maine to California, but simply that the Internet WORKS.  
When people write a letter and send it from Maine to California via 
the United States Postal Services (USPS), they know that the "to" 
and "from" addresses must be written in a certain place, that mail 
may be returned if there is a problem, and that mail may be disposed 
of after sitting idly on the shelf of the post office (if, for 
example, both addresses are illegible).  Internet e-mail works in 
much the same way.  Some of the TCP/IP protocols deal with how to 
send, return, and dispose of e-mail.

     The advantages of Internet e-mail over USPS mail and telephone 
calls are numerous.  Unlike with USPS mail, you don't have to find a 
stamp and drive to the nearest mailbox to send Internet e-mail.  And 
unlike the telephone, Internet e-mail is never busy.  I recently 
planned a ski trip in Maine entirely by e-mail.  I was able to make 
sure that each person got the same information, I could keep track 
of RSVPs, and I didn't have to worry about making phone calls.

     Not Just for Scientists Anymore.  The Internet has recently 
come out of the closet.  As more people get on the Internet, fewer 
people will be able to ignore the Internet.  Formerly used 
exclusively by government, military, and research users, the 
Internet is now being used by people in all lines of work.  Lawyers 
will need to get on the Internet to communicate with their clients 
and with each other.  1993 may go down in history as "the year of 
the Internet."  Consider that in 1993 there were more references to 
the Internet in the New York Times than there were in all previous 
years combined!  

     Summary.  When I was writing choosing a name for "The Legal 
List, Law-Related Resources on the Internet and Elsewhere," I 
initially had chosen "beyond" instead of "elsewhere."  However, I 
decided to go with "elsewhere" because in terms of electronic 
resources, NOTHING is beyond the Internet.  As big as value-added 
services (such as CompuServe and GEnie) may get, they will always be 
a subset of the Internet.  The "elsewhere" sections deal primarily 
with resources that are not on the Internet, but that may be 
someday.  And as the Internet expands, there will be more legal 
issues (intellectual property, privacy, and First Amendment issues 
to name a few) to tackle.  Was 1993 the year of the Internet?  I'm 
not sure, but I do know that the Internet is here to stay, and for 
lawyers and others who are concerned about the future of the 
Internet, now is the time to get on.

     "The Legal List" contains additional introductory information:

     For information on how to get:            See:

     introductory Internet information         Section A.1.
     introductory UUCP information             Section A.4.
     introductory BITNET information           Section A.5.
     additional introductory information       Section B.1.

1.3.  DISCLAIMER.  The author of "The Legal List" has made 
reasonable efforts to provide correct information, but the author, 
the University of Maine School of Law, the Maine Law and Technology 
Association, and Midnight Networks are not responsible for the 
accuracy of the information in "The Legal List."  Updates, 
additions, and corrections to "The Legal List" should be sent to 
legal-list@justice.eliot.me.us.

2.2.  E-MAIL.  Due to the size of "The Legal List," (and to keep 
justice.eliot.me.us running as efficiently as possible) I only send 
the initial release of "The Legal List" via e-mail to those who have 
subscribed to "The Legal List" mailing list (described below in 
Section 2.2.1).  I will NOT be able to send individual copies via e-
mail after the initial release.  However, you can still get a copy 
of "The Legal List" e-mailed to you by using FTPMAIL (see Section 
4.1) or by using the mail-server at MIT (see Section 2.5).

2.2.1.  MAILING LIST.  If you wish to be added to "The Legal List" 
Mailing List, send a message in the following form:

     To:  legal-list-request@justice.eliot.me.us

multiple copies of any messages.)

2.2.2.  UPDATES.  Updates, additions, and corrections to "The Legal 
List" should be sent to legal-list@justice.eliot.me.us.

2.3.  ANONYMOUS FTP.  "The Legal List" is available via anonymous

<!> 2.3.1.  INTERNET RESOURCE GUIDE - DIRECTORY OF DIRECTORIES.  
"The Legal List" is one of many resources officially documented by 
the InterNIC Directory and Database Services at the NSF Network 
Systems Center (NNSC) under a contract with AT&T.  The "Internet 
Resource Guide" (IRG), formerly compiled and maintained by BBN, 
Inc., for the NNSC is being transitioned to the "Directory of 
Directories" provided by the InterNIC Directory and Database 
Services.  In previous versions of "The Legal List," I wrote "[t]he 
[IRG] is invaluable, and everyone with a serious interest in the 
Internet should maintain a copy.  The NNSC's stated goal is 'to 
expose users to those facilities that will help them do their work 
better.'  (Internet Resource Guide, Introduction, dated 16 Apr 90.)  
I wholeheartedly agree with this goal."  Although the IRG in its 
1990-form is being discontinued, the entries are being incorporated 
into the NNSC's new "Directory of Directories."  The "Directory of 
Directories" should prove to be an invaluable resource.

For more information, contact:

     The InterNIC Directory and Database Services Administrator AT&T
     5000 Hadley Road Room 1B13
     South Plainfield, NJ  07080

3.1.14.  THE WHITE HOUSE.  The White House has several e-mail 
addresses including 75300.3155@compuserve.com, clintonpz@aol.com, 
MCI Mail "White House," president@whitehouse.gov, and vice-
president@whitehouse.gov.  The ".gov" addresses were created in June 
93 and appear to be the best.  Also, a Clinton volunteer e-mail 
campaign existed at one point, and it may still exist.  For more 
information send a message to clinton-info@campaign92.org with the 
word "help" as the subject.  (***Author's note:  I have not verified 
the clinton-info@campaign92.org address because when I joined the 
list in 1992, I had a "Hotel California" experience--I could sign 
on, but I could not sign off.  Proceed with caution.)

CRAM: The Cyberspatial Reality Advancement Movement

In an effort to bring valuable information to the masses, and as a
service to motivated information compilers, a member of CRAM can help
others unfamiliar with Usenet `publish' their documents for
widespread dissemination via the FAQ structure, and act as a
`sponsor' knowledgable in the submissions process. This document is
being distributed under this arrangement.

We have found these compilations tend to appear on various mailing
lists and are valuable enough to deserve wider distribution. If you
know of an existing compilation of Internet information that is not
currently a FAQ, please contact us and we may `sponsor' it. The
benefits to the author include:

- use of the existing FAQ infrastructure for distribution:
  - automated mail server service
  - FTP archival
  - automated posting

- a far wider audience that can improve the quality, accuracy, and 
  coverage of the document enormously through email feedback

- potential professional inquiries for the use of your document in 
  other settings, such as newsletters, books, etc.

- with us as your sponsor, we will also take care of the 
  technicalities in the proper format of the posted version and 
  updating procedures, leaving you free of the `overhead' to focus on 
  the basic updates alone

The choice of who we `sponsor' is entirely arbitrary. You always have
the option of handling the submission process yourself.  See the FAQ
submission guidelines FAQ in news.answers. 

For information, send mail to <tmp@netcom.com>.

DISTRIBUTION: How to obtain this document

This document has been brought to you in part by CRAM, involved in the
redistribution of valuable information to a wider USENET audience (see

CRAM: The Cyberspatial Reality Advancement Movement

In an effort to bring valuable information to the masses, and as a
service to motivated information compilers, a member of CRAM can help
others unfamiliar with Usenet `publish' their documents for
widespread dissemination via the FAQ structure, and act as a
`sponsor' knowledgable in the submissions process. This document is
being distributed under this arrangement.

We have found these compilations tend to appear on various mailing
lists and are valuable enough to deserve wider distribution. If you
know of an existing compilation of Internet information that is not
currently a FAQ, please contact us and we may `sponsor' it. The
benefits to the author include:

- use of the existing FAQ infrastructure for distribution:
  - automated mail server service
  - FTP archival
  - automated posting

- a far wider audience that can improve the quality, accuracy, and 
  coverage of the document enormously through email feedback

- potential professional inquiries for the use of your document in 
  other settings, such as newsletters, books, etc.

- with us as your sponsor, we will also take care of the 
  technicalities in the proper format of the posted version and 
  updating procedures, leaving you free of the `overhead' to focus on 
  the basic updates alone

The choice of who we `sponsor' is entirely arbitrary. You always have
the option of handling the submission process yourself.  See the FAQ
submission guidelines FAQ in news.answers. 

For information, send mail to <tmp@netcom.com>.

<!> 3.3.  BITNET AND UNIX LISTSERV GROUPS.  Many interest groups 
exist on BITNET.  A central computer maintains the list of 
subscribers to a particular interest group, and when you mail to 
this computer (running the LISTSERV program), LISTSERV mails your 
message to the subscribers.  In this way, membership lists only need 
to be maintained in one location.

     The BITNET LISTSERV software (which runs on IBM mainframes) has 
been ported to the UNIX environment.  The UNIX LISTSERV software, 
written by Anastasios C. Kotsikonas (Copyright (c) 1992), has many 
features similar to BITNET LISTSERV systems, although the syntax of 
commands may vary slightly.  UNIX LISTSERV sites typically do not 
have the cooperative features of the original LISTSERV software, 
which allow you to subscribe to any BITNET LISTSERV list from any 
BITNET LISTSERV server.  

     The following LISTSERV interest groups are of a legal nature.  
Most are BITNET LISTSERV interest groups, some are UNIX LISTSERV 
groups, a few are MAILBASE groups.  All e-mail addresses are given 
in Internet form, and most BITNET addresses are provided for BITNET 
LISTSERV groups.  The descriptions of the groups are in the 
following form:

     1.  The "how to subscribe" section.  Send a message to the 
     address following the "Subscribe to:" prompt.  The text 
     following the "Text of message:" prompt should be included in 
     your message.  "Your_name" should be your real name, e.g. John 
     Q. Smith.

          Subscribe to:  listserv@example.state.edu
               Text of message:  subscribe sample-l your_name

     2.  The "how to post messages" section.  Send the message you 
     want distributed to the groups subscribers to the address 
     following the "Post messages to:" prompt.

          Post messages to:  sample-l@example.state.edu

     3.  The "how to unsubscribe" section.  Send a message to the 
     address following the "Unsubscribe to:" prompt.  The text 
     following the "Text of message:" prompt should be included in 
     your message.

receiving an average of 5 messages per day.  Membership is open to 
any historian or graduate student.  Each list is moderated by a 
historian and has a board of editors.  The moderators control the 
flow of messages and reject those unsuitable for a scholarly 
discussion group.  The primary purpose of each list is to enable 
historians to easily communicate current research and teaching 
interests; to discuss new approaches, methods and tools of analysis; 
to share information on access to library catalogs and other 
electronic databases; and to test new ideas and share comments on 
current historiography.

of interest to professional Political Scientists, both Researchers

science as well as related disciplines are encouraged.  The list is 
not intended to serve as a public forum for debate over current 
issues in politics, as other lists already fill that niche.  Rather 
it is intended to provide an opportunity for political scientists to 
present their ideas and ongoing research for discussion, to consider 
the directions in which the discipline is advancing, and to 
encourage the dissemination of new concepts in research and 
teaching.  In addition to ongoing discussions, the list editors 
would like to post announcements of job openings and upcoming 
conferences.

4.  FTP-ACCESSIBLE RESOURCES
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This chapter describes law-related resources available via anonymous 
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) such as US Supreme Court decisions and 
Tufts University's Multilaterals Project.

4.1.  FTP VIA E-MAIL.  Some resources are available via anonymous 
FTP.  If you do not have access to FTP, but you do have access to e-
mail, send a message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with "help" in the 
body of the body of the message for information on their FTPMAIL 
(FTP by e-mail) service.

4.1.1.  FTPMAIL EXAMPLE.  For example, to get "The Legal List" via 
e-mail from DEC's FTPMAIL service, send the following message to 
ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com:

     connect ftp.midnight.com
     ascii
     get /pub/LegalList/README
     get /pub/LegalList/legallist.txt
     quit

The files will be e-mailed to you in a day or so.  If you have 
problems with FTPing to ftp.midnight.com, send a message to 
admin@midnight.com or legal-list@justice.eliot.me.us.

4.2.  SUPREME COURT DECISIONS.  

4.2.1.  PROJECT HERMES.  U.S. Supreme Court decisions are available 
online as part of "Project Hermes."  On May 11th, 1990 the United 
States Supreme Court announced that it was beginning a two-year 
experimental program with the objective to rapidly provide copies of 
the Court's opinions in electronic form to as wide an audience as 
possible.
 
One of the twelve participants is a noncommercial, nonprofit, 
consortium composed of Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), 
EDUCOM, and the National Public Telecomputing Network (NPTN).  You 
can electronically receive the full text of the Court's opinions 
within minutes of their release--free.
 
You may have the Court's opinions sent directly to you if you have 
access to either a BITNET or Internet computer or you may download 
the files directly from any NPTN community computer system.  To 
receive more information on how to sign up for the BITNET/Internet 
service, or if you would like to know more about accessing these 
files on an NPTN community computer, please send your name, 
organization or firm, address, city, state, and zip, to:  

     PROJECT HERMES
     CWRU COMMUNITY TELECOMPUTING LAB
     319 WICKENDEN BUILDING
     CLEVELAND, OH  44106.
 
For general information about Project Hermes or about the National 
Public Telecomputing Network, please contact: Tom Grundner at the 
above address or at (216) 368-2733.

You can also contact Project Hermes at aa584@cleveland.freenet.edu.

The consortium grants permission to download, reproduce, or re-post 
any of the Supreme Court opinion files PROVIDED NO CHANGES OR 
EDITING ARE MADE TO THE SUBJECT MATERIAL.  The consortium would 
greatly appreciate it if source credit were given to CWRU, EDUCOM, 
and the National Public Telecomputing Network if these files are 
used.

4.2.2.  FTP SITES.  The following are two of the anonymous FTP sites 
that maintain Supreme Court rulings:

CRAM: The Cyberspatial Reality Advancement Movement

In an effort to bring valuable information to the masses, and as a
service to motivated information compilers, a member of CRAM can help
others unfamiliar with Usenet `publish' their documents for
widespread dissemination via the FAQ structure, and act as a
`sponsor' knowledgable in the submissions process. This document is
being distributed under this arrangement.

We have found these compilations tend to appear on various mailing
lists and are valuable enough to deserve wider distribution. If you
know of an existing compilation of Internet information that is not
currently a FAQ, please contact us and we may `sponsor' it. The
benefits to the author include:

- use of the existing FAQ infrastructure for distribution:
  - automated mail server service
  - FTP archival
  - automated posting

- a far wider audience that can improve the quality, accuracy, and 
  coverage of the document enormously through email feedback

- potential professional inquiries for the use of your document in 
  other settings, such as newsletters, books, etc.

- with us as your sponsor, we will also take care of the 
  technicalities in the proper format of the posted version and 
  updating procedures, leaving you free of the `overhead' to focus on 
  the basic updates alone

The choice of who we `sponsor' is entirely arbitrary. You always have
the option of handling the submission process yourself.  See the FAQ
submission guidelines FAQ in news.answers. 

For information, send mail to <tmp@netcom.com>.

6.1.1.  VERONICA.  VERONICA stands for Very Easy Rodent-Oriented 
Net-wide Index.  VERONICA is to GopherSpace what Archie, a program 
developed by the McGill School of Computer Science, is to the 
Internet's anonymous FTP archives.  (For more information on Archie, 
see The Internet Resource Guide/Directory of Directories (see 
Section 2.3.1).)  VERONICA offers a keyword search of most of the 
Gopher-server menu titles in the world.  To try VERONICA, select it 
from the "Other Gophers" menu on the University of Minnesota's 
Gopher server.

6.2.  WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIV. - ARCHIVES.  The Washington & Lee 
archives (see Section 5.3) are also accessible via Gopher.

<!> 6.4.  CORNELL UNIV. - ARCHIVES.  Cornell Law School, through its 
wholly-owned subsidiary the Legal Information Institute, operates a 
Gopher server on fatty.law.cornell.edu (port 70).  It is focussed 
largely on legal information.  TEKNOIDS is archived there in 
searchable form, and LAW-LIB soon will be.  If you don't have a 
Gopher client, you can TELNET to fatty and log in as 'gopher'; 
you'll be placed in the UN*X gopher client.

     The Directory of Legal Academia is accessible via Gopher, 
TELNET, and electronic mail.  To use the Gopher version, simply find 
your way to the Gopher server at fatty.law.cornell.edu; there's a 
menu choice for it.  To use the TELNET version, TELNET to 
fatty.law.cornell.edu and login as 'lookup'.  Simple instructions 
are provided on the opening screen.  To use the mail version, send 
mail to lookup@fatty.law.cornell.edu.  Somewhere in the body of the 
mail message, you may place one or more queries in one of two forms:

     query name=Somebody
     query department=Somewhere

The 'query name' form looks up someone by name; the 'query 
department' form looks up someone by location, eg.

      query name=Bruce

returns five entries, including Thomas Bruce and Bruce Kennedy.

      query department=Harvard

returns entries for all personnel at the Harvard Law School.  There 
are about 1000 names of legal academics and law librarians currently 
in the database; we are looking for more.  To add or change 
information, send appropriate mail to:

      change-request@fatty.law.cornell.edu.

7.  WWW-ACCESSIBLE RESOURCES
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This chapter describes law-related resources available via the World 
Wide Web (WWW) (a distributed hypermedia system started by CERN, the 
European Laboratory for Particle Physics).

7.1.  WWW OVERVIEW.  WWW stands for the World Wide Web.  WWW, 
started by CERN (the European Laboratory for Particle Physics), is a 
distributed hypermedia system.  To access the Web, you run a browser 
program that can read and retrieve documents.  The browsers can 
access information via/from FTP, TELNET, Usenet, Gopher, WAIS, and 
others.  WWW does not have as many users as Gopher, mainly because 
of the small number of available WWW browsers.

The following are some of the Browsers accessible by TELNET (try to 
use sites near you):

     telnet ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu
          login:  www
          location:  U.S.

     telnet eies2.njit.edu
          login:  www
          password:  
          location:  U.S.

     telnet info.cern.ch
          login:  (none required)
          password:  
          location:  Switzerland

     telnet vms.huji.ac.il
          login:  www
          location:  Israel

     telnet sun.uakom.cs
          location:  Slovakia

     telnet info.funet.fi
          location:  Finland

<+> 7.2.  INDIANA UNIVERSITY.  Indiana University has produced a 
series of radio broadcasts containing general legal information.  
The broadcasts have been  digitized (in .au format) and are 
available via WWW.

WWW URL information:

     http://www.law.indiana.edu:80/law/lawtalk.html

For more information, contact:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
8.  WAIS-ACCESSIBLE RESOURCES
--------------------------------------------------------------------
8.1.  WAIS OVERVIEW.  WAIS, the Wide Area Information Servers, is a 
networked full text information retrieval system developed by 
Thinking Machines, Apple Computer, and Dow Jones.  WAIS currently 
uses TCP/IP to connect client applications to information servers.  
Client applications are able to retrieve text or multimedia 
documents stored on the servers.  Client applications request 
documents using keywords.  Servers search a full text index for the 
documents and return a list of documents containing the keyword.  
The client may then request the server to send a copy of any of the 
documents found.  The WAIS software distribution is available via 
anonymous FTP:

     ftp think.com
          get /wais/wais-8-b5.1.tar.Z (WAIS software)
          get /wais/wais-sources.tar.Z (current WAIS 
                                        sources/databases)
          cd /wais/doc (documentation, users guides, etc.)

If you are in Europe try the following first:

     ftp nic.funet.fi
          cd /pub/networking/services/wais (WAIS files)

8.2.  WAIS SOURCES.  The easiest way to get started (if you do not 
have access to a  WAIS client) is to try the WAIS at Thinking 
Machines:

     telnet quake.think.com
          login:  wais

A notable WAIS site is Columbia University Law Library.  Search on 
"LAW" to see law-related sources.

APPENDIX A.  INTERNET, UUCP, AND USENET INFORMATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This appendix contains, for example, information on how to get on 
the Internet, i.e.. how to purchase an Internet account.

A.1.  INTRODUCTORY INTERNET INFORMATION.  To receive introductory 
information on the Internet, send a message to service@nic.ddn.mil 
the subject line "RFC1325" (without the quotations).  You will 
receive the Request For Comments (RFC) "Questions and Answers for 
New Internet Users."  (This service is documented in The Internet 
Resource Guide/Directory of Directories.  See Section 2.3.1.).

A.2.  INTERNET, UUCP, AND USENET PROVIDERS.  There is not a bright 
line separating "domain providers" and "account providers."  In 
general, "domain providers" have close ties to the Internet, and 
"account providers" do not.  "Domain providers" sell Internet links 
to organizations, "account providers" sell e-mail accounts to 
individuals.  However, the services offered by each are constantly 
changing.  The following are the major commercial Internet, UUCP, 
and USENET providers.

A.3.1.  DOMAIN PROVIDERS.  The companies listed in this section can 
provide you with domain service.  In other words, if you want to use 
the domain "mycompany.com" for your new company (called "My 
Company") these are the providers you should contact.

DISTRIBUTION: How to obtain this document

This document has been brought to you in part by CRAM, involved in the
redistribution of valuable information to a wider USENET audience (see
below). The most recent version of this document can be obtained via
the author's instructions at the beginning. The following directions 
apply to retrieve the possibly less-current USENET FAQ version.

CRAM: The Cyberspatial Reality Advancement Movement

In an effort to bring valuable information to the masses, and as a
service to motivated information compilers, a member of CRAM can help
others unfamiliar with Usenet `publish' their documents for
widespread dissemination via the FAQ structure, and act as a
`sponsor' knowledgable in the submissions process. This document is
being distributed under this arrangement.

We have found these compilations tend to appear on various mailing
lists and are valuable enough to deserve wider distribution. If you
know of an existing compilation of Internet information that is not
currently a FAQ, please contact us and we may `sponsor' it. The
benefits to the author include:

- use of the existing FAQ infrastructure for distribution:
  - automated mail server service
  - FTP archival
  - automated posting

- a far wider audience that can improve the quality, accuracy, and 
  coverage of the document enormously through email feedback

- potential professional inquiries for the use of your document in 
  other settings, such as newsletters, books, etc.

- with us as your sponsor, we will also take care of the 
  technicalities in the proper format of the posted version and 
  updating procedures, leaving you free of the `overhead' to focus on 
  the basic updates alone

The choice of who we `sponsor' is entirely arbitrary. You always have
the option of handling the submission process yourself.  See the FAQ
submission guidelines FAQ in news.answers. 

For information, send mail to <tmp@netcom.com>.
