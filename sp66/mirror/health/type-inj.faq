This file details changes to the ftp.csua.berkeley.edu archive and summarizes
what's new in the various FAQ (frequently asked questions) documents.
This will be posted monthly, along with the full FAQ to the various net
groups.  The various mailing lists will either receive the full FAQ
every month, or every third month, but will always get this file, once
per month.  Phew!

Changes to the Typing Injury FAQ and ftp.csua.berkeley.edu archive, this month
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First off, I need to apologize again for tardiness on getting this out.
As everybody knows, life tends to swamp you sometimes, and your hobbies
tend to get left behind.  Hopefully, I'll be able to keep up with the
rush of new info, as it occurs.  Luckily, the world has improved a lot
in the last few years, and it's actually possible to get some of these
products at your local computer store.  My, would I be happy if my FAQ
were rendered obsolete.  Yeah, right.

		New files in the typing-injury archive
		======================================

arms-blurb -- info about the Association for Repetitive Motion Syndromes

    how it relates to myofascial pain syndrome

			 Elsewhere...
			 ============

I've added a new bunch of information to the General Info FAQ, including
pointers to the AOL weekly RSI discussion, a list of some books, and
other stuff.  If you haven't read the General Info section in a while,
you might want to take a quick look and make sure I haven't goofed.


HELP SAVE THE WORLD!
--------------------

I need volunteers.  You can volunteer for one-time- only tasks, or a
continuing commitment.  I have a number of tasks, including marking up
various archive texts in HTML, maintaining other FAQ pages (I want
somebody to track the weird-mouse market), and more.  Do you have what it
takes to push the typing-injury archive "to the next level"?  Send me
mail: dwallach@cs.princeton.edu

General info on injuries
------------------------

First, and foremost of importance: if you experience pain at all, then
you absolutely need to go see a doctor.  As soon as you possibly can.  The
difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery
and a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety
doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally,
any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in
these kinds of problems.  DON'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.

The remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from
a wonderful report by New Zealand's Department of Labour (Occupational
Safety and Health Service): "Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and
Rehabilitation: A Practitioner's Guide".

First, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands):
(note: you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)

  RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries
  OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI
  CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI
  WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI
  CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)
  Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.
  Pronation: Turning the palm down.
  Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.
  Supination: Turning the palm up.
  Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.
  Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.
  Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.
  Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.
  Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.
  Abduction: Moving away from the body.
  Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.

Now then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse
conditions.  Local problems are what you'd expect: specific muscles,
tendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt.
Diffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle
discomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of
tenderness in muscles, although they're not necessarily "the problem."

--- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here's the theory.

Normally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which
pass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict
the blood flow.  By the time you're exerting 50% of your full power,
you're completely restricting your blood flow.

Without fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out,
then they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates
nasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.

Once one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the
load.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes
things worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow,
and the cycle continues.

Another by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from
your nerves.  They need blood too.

Anyway, when you're typing too much, you're never really giving a change
for the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never
relax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor
ergonomics, only make things worse.

--- Specific injuries you may have heard of:

(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute
injuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have
less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)

Tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis
occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to
cause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability
to lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets
inflamed, and you've got your problem.

Tendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon
can cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating,
and can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more
swelling, and more pain.  "Sub-acute" tendonitis is more common, which entails
a dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse
with repetitive activity.

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your
fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include
feeling "pins and needles", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation.
CTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.

Adverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension', this is where
the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly
compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere.
AMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS 
disorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy 
(brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).

Others: for just about every part of your body, there's a fancy name for
a way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS
conditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors
misdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you
may have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion
before somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).

Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment
-------------------------------------------------

The most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce
tension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax.
If you're under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out
the world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding
principle in your work: every three minutes take a three second break.
EVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every
three minutes.  It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings,
calm down, and relax.

If you can't sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and
relaxation are really a big deal.

There are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce
inflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad
posture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen
your muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture
and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold
contrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what's best
for you.

--- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was
written in the New Zealand book that I'm lifting it almost verbatim from
Appendix 10. -- dwallach]

. Let your shoulders relax.
. Let your elbows swing free.
. Keep your wrists straight.
. Pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward.
. Keep the hollow in the base of your spine.
. Try leaning back in the chair.
. Don't slouch or slump forward.
. Alter your posture from time to time.
. Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.

Set the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There 
should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees,
and your thighs should not slope too much.

Now, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable
to work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy
is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a
footrest.

Now, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space
between the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in
the hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this
area.

If you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning
back, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.

[Now, I diverge a little from the text]

A good chair makes a big difference.  If you don't like your chair, go
find a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle,
back height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in
the way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm
rests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good
store and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for you.
In the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend "Just Chairs."  The
name says it all.

--- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:

There is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some
people, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you
shouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your
keyboard to be "right there".  If you drop your arms at your side and then
lift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands
when your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid
pronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads
may or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and
look at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It's
often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or
deviated hands.

Some argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly
designed.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today.
Check out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail.

Lately, a number of people have been having luck with gloves.  You
may want to try some light gloves, possibly with the fingers removed
if they're too warm.  Many seem to like the Handeze Gloves, available
for around $20 from Patternworks, P.O. Box 1690, Poughkeepsie, NY 12601
(800/438-5464).  See the ftp.csua file "handeze.info" for details.

Another place you may be able to get stuff: a company called Enrichments
has a catalog of ergonomic products you may find interesting.  Their
phone number is 800/323-5547.  Or, you might want to contact AliMed
at 800/225-2610 and ask for their Ergonomics catalog.

Here are some sources for fancy keyboard drawers:

Ergotron, Eagan, MN, 800/888-8458.  A wide tray that mounts under a desk
and is adjustable, has a wrist rest, and is wide enough to accomodate a
mouse pad.

Ergo Systems, East Hartford, CT, 203/282-9767.  They make keyboard trays
and a retractrable mouse pad, too.

Rubbermaid makes a simple $20 plastic keyboard tray that works well.  I
found mine at CompUSA, so check your local computer store.


Requests for more info
----------------------

Clearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive
is incomplete.  There's always more information out there.  If you'd like
to submit something, please send me mail, and I'll gladly throw it in.

If you'd like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be
wonderful!  I'd love somebody to make a comprehensive list of mice.  I'd
love somebody to make a list of doctors.  I'd love somebody to edit the
above sections, looking for places where I've obviously goofed.

Using a PC's keyboard on your workstation / compatibility issues
----------------------------------------------------------------

1) Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port

    If you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard
    (Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding
    a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation
    runs the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used
    PC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable
    to your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read
    the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.

    A number of programs can facilitate this for you.  kt and a2x
    support ASCII input.  a2x-RawPC and serkey support raw PC scancode
    input.  Also, the new version of kt (kt18) additionally supports
    raw PC scancodes.

    a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse,
    and even moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server
    extension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if
    your server can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these	
    strings appear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't
    have this, you may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel
    18 or later, or bugging your vendor.

    kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X
    servers.  Another program called xsendevent also exists, but I
    haven't seen it.

    a2x-RawPC, serkey, and kt18 can take input from a device such as the
    Genovation Serial Box which converts a PC keyboard into a normal
    RS232 serial device, but otherwise passes through the raw PC
    scancodes.  This approach has several advantages: a Serial Box is
    only $150, whereas the cheapest used PC you may ever find is over
    $300.  A Serial Box could easily fit in your pocket, while PC's
    tend to be much bigger.  Most important, however, is the ability
    to use *all* the keys of your PC keyboard with your workstation,
    like the function keys.

    a2x, a2x-RawPC, serkey and kt are all available via anonymous ftp
    from ftp.csua.berkeley.edu.

    Genovation can be contacted at:
	17741 Mitchell North
	Irvine, CA  92714, U.S.A.

	Voice: 714-833-3355
	Fax:   714-833-0322

    Apparently, you can also find it for $94+shipping from a mail order
    company called "United Computer Express", at 800-448-3738.

    Kinesis is also reselling the Genovation boxes under their
    own label.

    Warning: apparently, the Genovation serial box doesn't work with
    the Maltron keyboard.

2) Macintosh

    Kinesis Corp. now has an adapter to make a PC keyboard connect to
    a Macintosh.  They'll happily sell you the adapter without one
    of their keyboards.  The price is around $100.  Call 800-454-6374.	    ||

    A similar product is made by the Silicon Valley Bus Company, which	    ||
    supports PC mice and keyboards.  It's called the KeyStone and costs	    ||
    $99 plus $6 shipping.						    ||

	Silicon Valley Bus Company					    ||
	475 Brown Rd.							    ||
	San Juan Bautista, CA  95045					    ||

	Phone: 408-623-2300 or maybe 800-775-0555			    ||


3) X terminals

    Also, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronix, to name a few) use
    PC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all
    set.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the
    trouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add
    extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around
    for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.

4) NeXT

    NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop
    Bus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they
    were cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of
    upgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!

5) Silicon Graphics

    Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and
    beyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't
    believe this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not
    possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by
    upgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more
    details.

6) IBM RS/6000

    IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.
    Unfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a
    cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the
    smaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe
    it or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it
    works.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been
    told Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn
    anything new, please send me e-mail.

    Several people have reported problems contacting IBM on this
    issue.  Be sure to bug your sales rep into doing the research.
    Again, let me know if you learn anything new.

7) HP workstations

    If you are using an HP workstation, you can buy a converter
    box that converts the HP-HIL serial to PS2. The converter is
    made by Modular Industrial Computers 615-499-0700.

8) Other stuff

    Some vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)
    support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your
    queries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can
    get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either
    from the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in
    luck.  Contact the companies for more details.

"Normal" keyboards -- things that look like "standard" QWERTY keyboards

    Shipping: Now.
    Supports: Mac

    Apple's keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections
    rotate backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The
    keys are arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.

    The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.
    A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.

    The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not
    directly attachable to the keyboard.

    Many peripheral keys, such as function keys, are "chicklet" keys, rather
    than full size, normal keyboard keys.

    The idea is that one keyboard works with everything.  You purchase
    "compatibility modules", a new cord, and possibly new keycaps, and
    then you can move your one keyboard around among different machines.

    It's a three-piece folding keyboard.  The layout resembles the
    standard 101-key keyboard, except sliced into three sections.  Each
    section is on a "custom telescoping universal mount."  Each section
    independently adjusts to an infinite number of positions allowing each
    individual to type in a natural posture.  You can rearrange the three
    sections, too (have the keypad in the middle if you want).  Each
    section is otherwise normal-shaped (i.e.: you put all three sections
    flat, and you have what looks like a normal 101-key keyboard).

    Other features: full remapping and macros, programmable delay and
    repeat times.  Coming soon: bounce keys and sticky keys.  Also coming
    soon: non-volatile RAM (NVRAM) to store macros (currently, the PC
    downloads them at boot time).

    Anyone with an old Comfort (serial number < 5000) can upgrade to a
    newer version of the keyboard.  Call technical assistance (414-253-6900)
    for more details.  The upgrade will generally cost $189, depending
    on the state of the original keyboard.

    Each hand has its own "pod".  Each of the four main fingers has five
    switches each: forward, back, left, right, and down.  The thumbs have
    a number of switches.  Despite appearances, the key layout resembles
    QWERTY, and is reported to be no big deal to adapt to.  The idea is
    that your hands never have to move to use the keyboard.  A finger-mouse
    is also built-in.

    If you ask, they'll send you a 15 minute video tape and lots of
    other information.

    Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.  It's
    another split-design.  One thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both
    the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section.
    The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key PC keyboard.

    Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards, also, so this product will
    probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.

    Keytronic is working together with ErgoLogic Enterprises on this,
    so it's the same keyboard.

	wrist pads and a TypingTutor program.  Foot pedals and other
	accessories are extra.
    Supports: PC.  Mac and Sun Sparc through emulation boxes.
    Shipping: Now.

    The layout has a large blank space in the middle, even though the
    keyboard is about the size of a normal PC keyboard -- slightly
    smaller.  Each hand has its own set of keys, laid out to minimize
    finger travel.  Thumb buttons handle many major functions (enter,
    backspace, etc.).

    The keyboard supports remapping, macros, and adjustable repeat rate.

    Foot pedals are also available, and can be mapped to any key on the
    keyboard (shift, control, whatever).

    The keypad is "embedded" in the right hand, and a toggle button
    (or foot pedal) changes between normal and keypad mode for your
    right hand.

    Software is newly available that lets you split the Kinesis into
    multiple personalities so you can have more than one set of macros
    and remappings available.  This software runs on your PC and downloads
    the data to the keyboard.  For more info, contact the company.

    Kinesis has a number of prototype adapters which can be used to
    connect the Kinesis (or other PC keyboards) to Mac, Sun, or HP.  They
    also resell a serial-port adapter (the Genovation) which can be used
    to connect the Kinesis (or other PC keyboards) to anything with a
    serial port.  Again, for more info, contact the company.

    [Description by Chris Grant]					    ||

    This keyboard is a split/ angled one, with a ball-type hinge at the	    ||
    top of the split.  You can put it into positions identical to the	    ||
    Ergologic and similar to most Comfort positions (but it doesn't tent    ||
    when the parts are separated).  You can separate the parts when flat    ||
    like the Kinesis.  It has a conventional layout so differs from the	    ||
    Kinesis.  It's not programmable.  Aside from the split/angle (which is  ||
    extremely versatile and stable), its only other difference from	    ||
    regular keyboards is that the left part of the space bar can be a	    ||
    backspace key.							    ||

    The keyboard includes a built-in "pointing-stick" much IBM's	    ||
    ThinkPad portable computers.					    ||

    a mouth-stick.

    The layout allocates more buttons to the thumbs, and is curved to
    bring keys closer to the fingers.  A separate keypad is in the middle.

    The newer Maltrons have a different layout than the pictures on
    ftp.csua.berkeley.edu.  Function keys, tab, and some other secondary
    keys have been rearranged.  The shift keys are now larger, also.

    The MiniErgo is a split keyboard system with no numeric keypad
    (keypad available separately in August).  The two halves are
    fixed at about a 30 degree angle, to approximate the angle of
    your arms when you hands are in QWERTY home position.  The slant
    is approximately same as standard 101-key keyboard.  They've
    moved the cursor controls into the gap between the two halves.  A
    Fn key is used to access an embedded keypad and PgUp,PgDn,Home,
    and End.

    Shipping: "in limited quantities"

    A trackball module is also available ($100), which can clip on the side
    or replace the cursor keypad.

    The keyboard is broken down into three modules which can be re-
    arranged.  (the keypad could be put on the left, for example).
    The alphanumeric keys are vertical rather than the usual diagonal
    arrangement.

    The keyboard is based on the Datadesk Switchboard -- Somers just
    developed a new keyboard module for it.  Thus, they take advantage
    of the Switchboard's PC and Mac compatibility.  You can't plug
    it into both at the same time, but you need only use the right
    cable, and tweak some DIP switches to change the keyboard's
    personality.

    Doesn't use conventional push-keys.  Soft rubber keys, which rock
    forward and backward (each key has three states), make chords for
    typing keys.  Learning time is estimated to be 2-3 hours, for getting
    started, and maybe two weeks to get used to it.

    Currently, the thumbs don't do anything, although a thumb-trackball
    is in the works.

    the same combinations as a-j with dot 3 added. Letters u, v, x, y, and
    z are like a-e with dots 3 and 6 added.  (w is unique because Louis
    Braille didn't have a w in the French alphabet.)

    Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products.  Most (if
    not all) of them seem to run on PC's and compatibles (including PS/2's
    and other MicroChannel boxes).  They sell you a hardware board and
    software which sits in front of a number of popular word processors
    and spreadsheets.  Dragon has recently announced "DDWIN", which extends ||
    Dragon support to all Microsoft Windows applications.		    ||

    Each user `trains' the system to their voice, and there are provisions
    to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly.  Multiple
    people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file
    for each person.  You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.
    On the DragonDictate Classic, you need to pause 1/10th sec between
    words.  Dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute.

    Dragon's technology is also part of the following products
    (about which I have little-to-no other info):

	Microsoft Windows Sound System (Voice Pilot)
	IBM VoiceType

    IBM VoiceType is essentially a repackaged Dragon product.  It has
    an active dictionary of 7000 words and a "backup" dictionary of
    100k words.

    This product is essentially obsoleted by newer IBM and Dragon
    offerings, so you probably don't want it.

    Price: InfoGrip-compatible: "a few hundred dollars" + a one-handed Bat
	  For their own system: $300 (DOS software) + "a few hundred dollars"
    
    Shipping: these are custom-made, so an occupational therapist would
	  make moulds/do whatever to make it for you.  You can buy one now.
    
    Supports: PC only, although the InfoGrip-compatible version might
	  work with a Mac.

    In a one-handed version, there is exactly one button per finger.  In a
    two-handed version, you get four buttons per finger, and the thumbs
    don't do anything.  You can also get one-handed versions with three
    thumb buttons -- compatible with the InfoGrip Bat.  Basically, get it
    any way you want.

    They also have a software tutorial to help you learn the chording,
    which can also be used as a one-handed chording system for most
    DOS apps, using the standard keyboard.

    Works on a PC under DOS, not Windows.  Planning on Macintosh and
    PC/Windows support.  No work has been done on a Unix version, yet.

Software Tools to help with RSI
-------------------------------

This file describes tools, primarily software, to help prevent or manage
RSI.  This version now includes information on diverse tools such as
calendar programs and even digital watches, which tends to contradict the
title somewhat.  It also includes information on software for pain-free
use of mice and keyboard s - it draws the line at hardware, which is the
subject of the Keyboard Alternati ves FAQ.

Please let me know if you come across any other tools, or if you have
informati on or opinions on these ones, and I will update this FAQ. I am
especially interest ed in getting reviews of these products from people
who have evaluated them or are using them. The major difficulty with all
these products is that when you are under pressure you tend to cancel out
of the break reminder almost automaticall y - any suggestions on how to
avoid this would be appreciated.

Changes in this version:

    More information on using AccessDOS and Access Pack for Windows to reduce 
    problems with mice, especially double clicking and drag operations.

    More information on Dvorak keyboard layouts, especially for DOS and Windows.


Typing management tools
-----------------------

Typing management tools aim to help you manage your keyboard use,
by warning you to take a break every so often.  The better ones also
include advice on exercises, posture and workstation setup.  A few use
sound hardware to alert you to a break, but the majority use beeps or
screen messages.

Often, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has a
delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing all day
with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening.  These tools
act as an early warning system: by listening to their warnings and taking
breaks with exercises, you don't have to wait for your body to give you a
more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI.

1) Activity Monitoring Program (commercial software)

    Available from:
        Anthony Steven
        Office Automation Systems
        7 Clarks Terrace
        Heworth
        YORK
        YO3 0DQ
        Tel & Fax: +44 (904) 423622
    Platforms: Windows
    Description:
        This product is specifically aimed at helping employers meet the
        requirements of EC directive 90/270, so it is of most interest to
        European users.  It does not provide animations of exercises, instead
        providing them in the manual - the rationale for this is that the
        EC directive requires breaks to be taken away from the computer, so
        sitting at your keyboard doing exercises is not allowed.  In any case,
        it is better for you to stretch your legs as well as arms, and rest
        your eyes by leaving the computer, so this seems sensible.  The
        program feels less intrusive than some others as a result, it simply
        pops up a small window asking you to take a break.

        Unlike most other programs, you can set a hierarchy of some
        work then micropause, longer work then short pause, and still
        longer work then a long pause.  This hierarchy is closer to
        medical recommendations than just taking a break every N
        minutes.

	Also, this program is only activated by keyboard or mouse
	activity, unlike some other programs that pop up at a given time
	even if you are not at your PC.

        The program does not let you exit it or change the settings without a
        password (though this protection is configurable) - ideal for companies
        that want to discourage people from bypassing the program.

    The latest version has some improvements: a TSR is supplied so that
    typing in a DOS window will not affect the accuracy of the break times;
    the program beeps three times before a break to let you stop typing
    before it grabs control from the current window; and the minimised icon
    shows you when the next break is due, changing periodically to cycle through
    all the break times.


2) At Your Service (commercial software)

    Available from:
        Bright Star
        Tel: +1 (206) 451 3697
    Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4), Windows
    Description:
        Provides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info.
        Warns when to take a break (configurable).  Has a few recommendations
        on posture, and exercises.  Sound-oriented, will probably work best
        with sound card (PC) or with microphone (Mac).  Should be possible
        to record your own messages to warn of break.

3) AudioPort (sound card and software)

    Available from:
        Media Vision
        Tel: +1 (510) 226 2563
    Platforms: PC
    Description:
        A sound card to plug into your PC parallel port.
        Includes 'At Your Service'.

4) Computer Health Break (commercial software)

    Available from:
        Escape Ergonomics, Inc
        1111 W. El Camino Real
        Suite 109
        Mailstop 403
        Sunnyvale, CA
        Tel: +1 (408) 730 8410
    Platforms: DOS
    Description:
        Aimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take
        breaks after a configurable interval, based on clock time, or
        after a set number of keystrokes -- whichever is earlier.
        It gives you 3 exercises to do each time, randomly selected from
        a set of 70.  Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work
        you do - data entry, word processing, information processing.
        Exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on
        how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does.

        CHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use
        to learn more about RSI and how to prevent it.  Other information
        on non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer.
        A full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.

        CHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then
        warn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear
        useful when used with Windows.

        Cost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.

    Comments:
        The keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better
        to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to
        measure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuff
        is very good and includes some summaries of research papers,
        as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company
        to pay up for RSI management tools.


5) DOS Stretch (commercial software)

    Available from:
        John Fricker Software

        Tel: 503/488-5699
        Mail: 71054.261@compuserve.com
    Platforms: DOS (Hercules, EGA, VGA)

        Demo (VGA only, single exercise) available from:
            Compuserve: Health and Fitness Forum, Issues At Work section,
                            file DSDEMO.EXE

    Description:
        This break reminder program includes exercises but no ergonomic
        information. It includes 11 exercises, taking about four minutes.
        They are animated using a cartoon figure.  The demo includes a
        hand exercise that seems useful; the full program includes a
        reminder TSR.

        Cost: $27.00


6) Exercise Break [formerly StressFree] (commercial software, free usable demo)

    Available from:

                        Health and Fitness Forum, Issues At Work section.
                        (Windows and Mac versions in latter)
            Anon FTP:   ftp.cica.indiana.edu (and mirroring sites)
          CIX: rsi conference

    Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1), Mac System 6.0.5 or higher, DOS version soon
    Description:
        Aimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take
        breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times).
        Displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are
        animated and program paces you to help you do exercises at the
        correct rate.  Quite a few exercises, can configure which ones
        are included to a large extent.  One useful feature is that when
        it is running minimised it shows the time to the next break, helping
        you plan your work to the next break rather than it coming as an
        interruption.

        The new release, 3.0, is renamed Exercise Break, supports Mac and
        Windows and should include a DOS version. I have been trying out
        a beta version and it has some useful features, including
        Typewatch (no relation to the freeware program ...), which graphs
        your typing rate over time, with optional warnings to slow down
        and export facilities for spreadsheet analysis.  It also includes
        a full ergonomic checklist online to help set up your workstation,
        and a picture of correct posture and workstation adjustment.

        An unusual feature is the ability to include your own exercises in
	the program, providing you have access to a Windows SDK, without
	programming.

        Cost: $29.95 if supported via CompuServe or Internet, otherwise $39.95.
              Site license for 3 or more copies is $20.00 each.

    Comments:
	This is the only tool with a redistributable demo that is not just
	a slide show, so if you do get the demo, post it on your local
	bulletin boards, FTP servers and Bitnet servers!  Includes the
	ability to step backward in the exercise sequence, which is good
	for repeating the most helpful exercises.  Hopefully a number of
	add-on exercise modules will become available now that it is
	possible to add exercises.

7) EyerCise (commercial software)

    Available from:
        RAN Enterprises

    Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1), OS/2 PM (1.3/2.0) [Not DOS]
    Description:
        Aimed at preventing RSI and eye strain, this program warns you to take
        breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Optionally
        displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are
        animated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the
        correct rate.  Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training
        exercises, can configure which are included and how many repetitions
        you do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes.  Also includes online help

        Quote from their literature:

        "EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic
        sets of stretches and visual training exercises.  The stretches work
        all parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent
        Repetitive Strain Injury.  The visual training exercises will improve
        your peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain.  Together these
        help you to become more relaxed and productive."

        "The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C.
        Godnig, O.D. and John S. Hacunda, which describes the ergonomic setup
        for a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to
        promote healthy and efficient computer use.

        I have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say
        it is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it
        does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, it
        interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which
        is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on
        Windows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure
        why. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has
        one window without window controls.  Very usable though, and does not
        require any sound hardware.

10) Typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (October 1992)

    Available from:
        Anon. ftp:
	    ftp.csua.berkeley.edu:/pub/typing-injury/software/typewatch.shar
        CIX: sco conference
        Email to richardd@cix.compulink.co.uk
    Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO, SunOS, Mach; character and X Window mode)
    Description:
        This is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you
        to stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously
        typing.  It does not provide exercises, but it does check
        that you really do take a break, and tells you when you
        can start typing again.

        Typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing
        today, each time it warns you, which is useful so you
        know how much you *really* type.  It also logs information
        to a file that you can analyse or simply print out.

        The warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),
        in a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message
        (for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu>
        has put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for
        X, Zephyr and Mach.

        Not formally supported, but email richardd@cix.compulink.co.uk
        (for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,
        X Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give
        feedback.

11) Various calendar / batch queue programs

    Available from:
        Various sources
    Platforms: Various
    Description:
        Any calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming
        appointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.
        Alternatively, use any batch queue submission program that lets
        you submit a program to run at a specific time to display
        a message to the screen.

        Using Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and
        include this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line so
        you get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you
        want to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.
        Press F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter
        9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break
        is for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat
        for the next appointment.

        By using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes
        that set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this
        file on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, with
        a single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments
        with RSI exercises.

        The above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs.
        An example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job
        that runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will
        depend a lot on your operating system.

    On Windows 3.x, you can use Barclock 2.2 or above - this gives you
    a clock in the current window title bar, and also lets you type in
    a message to be popped up every hour (or even more frequently if
    you set multiple alarms).  Not intended for this purpose but simple
    and effective, Barclock is available on many BBSs as BARCLK22.ZIP.

        While these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing
        yourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI
        management tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to
        write a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating
        system, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.

12) Digital watches with count-down timers

    Available from:
        Various sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.
    Description:
        Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable
        number of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either
        manually or automatically.

        While these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you
        are writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from
        a computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great
        advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you
        are doing.

    Comments:
        My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to
        my writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which
        actually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left
        arm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been
        very useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.

        I have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but
        these are not much good because they do not give an audible
        warning of the end of the time period!

Keyboard and mouse control tools
--------------------------------

Keyboard control tools enable you to change your keyboard
mapping so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed
layout.  One-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how
you use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you are
simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing, and
may therefore simply cause your remaining "good" hand/arm to deteriorate.

Mouse control tools change the way your mouse works to avoid or modify
operations that are painful - mouse dragging is a common problem.

1) hsh (public domain)

    Available from:
        Anon. ftp: ftp.csua.berkeley.edu:/pub/typing-injury/software/hsh.shar
    Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones)
    Description:
        Allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.
        Only works through tty's (so you can use it with a terminal or
        an xterm, but not most X programs).

2) Dvorak keyboard tools (various)

    Available from:
        Anon. ftp: ftp.csua.berkeley.edu:/pub/typing-injury/software/xdvorak.c
        Available as standard in Microsoft Windows, Windows for Workgroups and
	    Windows NT
	Available for MS-DOS
    Description:
        To quote the Microsoft documentation:

            Dvorak keyboard layouts are based on designs created by August
            Dvorak, a professor at the University of Washington during the
            1930s and 1940s. Dr. Dvorak studied the way people type standard
            English, and determined the most common letter combinations. He
            then designed new keyboard layouts to speed up typing and reduce
            fatigue. These layouts, now called Dvorak or simplified keyboards,
            were initially developed for two-handed typists. Following World
            War II, Dvorak layouts were developed for typists who use the right
            or left hand alone.

	It is doubtful that switching to Dvorak will have a major impact
	on RSI, but it may be helpful in preventing RSI.  If you do switch,
	your typing rate will go down a lot initially, which will help!

        Microsoft Windows products support Dvorak as a standard keyboard
	layout - look in the International setup in the Control panel.  

        MS-DOS supports this via the MS-DOS Supplemental Disk, available from 
        Microsoft, which includes standard and one-handed Dvorak layouts.  
        These layouts are available for Windows in Application Note GA0650, 
        available from Microsoft or from various online services as GA0650.ZIP.

        In the US, training and keycap stickersfor the Dvorak layout are 
        available from:

	    KEYTIME
	    4516 NE 54th St.
	    Seattle, WA  98105-2933
	    Tel: (206) 324-7219 (voice and fax)

	If you are also looking at alternative keyboards, you might also
	like to look at the Maltron layout, which is claimed to be more
	efficient than Dvorak.  See the alternative keyboard FAQ for
	supplier details.

3) AccessDOS, Access Pack for Windows (free commercial software)

    Available from:
        Microsoft, Compuserve, Genie, Microsoft Online,
	Microsoft Download Service, BBSs
    Platforms: DOS, Windows
    Description:
	AccessDOS has a range of keyboard and mouse control features that
	may be useful, such as sticky shift keys to avoid stretching to
	hold down shift at same time as other keys, and using the keyboard
	for mouse functions.  It also allows serial-line interfacing of
	alternative keyboards and other devices.  AccessDOS is available
	from Microsoft on the MS-DOS Supplemental Disk.

	Access Pack for Windows has roughly the same features but in a
	Windows environment.  The mouse functions of Access Pack for
	Windows are  useful for people who find using the mouse painful.
	You can use the numeric keypad, with Num Lock off, to do
	operations like drag and drop without holding down a mouse button
	or a key on the keyboard.  You can also do double click from the
	keyboard by pressing a single key just once.  You can  use cursor
	control keys for all mouse movements, though this is rather slow,
	as you might expect.  The mouse functions probably work best if
	you can use some kind of ergonomic mouse or trackball and just
	avoid double click and drag operations as described.  You can work
	entirely without a mouse - if you want to use a real mouse as well
	as Access Pack functions, it must be Microsoft Mouse compatible.

4) PowerClicks, Mouse2 (shareware)

    Available from:
        Anon. ftp:
	    sumex.stanford.edu:/info-mac/cfg/power-clicks-102.hqx (PowerClicks)
	    sumex.stanford.edu:/info-mac/cfg/mouse-2.hqx (PowerClicks)
    Platforms: Mac
    Description:
    (From Charles Hsieh)
    PowerClicks is a cdev that can replace mouse click and mouse
    click-holding with self-defined keyboard combinations.  For example,
    I use my right hand to move the mouse around, and use my left hand
    to press F1 for mouse click, and F2 for mouse click-holding.

    Mouse2 makes the mouse move twice as fast, so that your hand doesn't
    have to move as far.

    Cost: PowerClicks is $3

Rumors and calls for information
--------------------------------

We've heard rumor of a furniture system called the "Forminco Power
Center," but haven't found them anywhere in our limited search.  If
anyone can get us contact information, we can add it to the list.

    [Forminco can be reached at:

     -- dwallach]

We've also had some interest in furniture for the disabled (or whatever
the current PC term is for people other than us TABs [Temporarily
Able Bodied]).  If anyone is aware of furniture designed for non-TABs
or has had any luck using or modifying any commercially available
furniture or knows about any companies who manufacture equipment
for non-TABs that could be persuaded to develop something, please
let me know.


Furniture Information
---------------------
 
OK, what we have here is a list of all the manufacturers of computer type
office furniture that I know of.  The style of furniture and any known
dimensions are listed together with the addresses of the manufacturer (if
known) and any known suppliers.  Also, I'll make a rough stab at what it
would cost to equip me with appropriate tableage for each manufacturer.

DISCLAIMER: I have no interest, financial or otherwise an any supplier
listed in this FAQ.  I have not (at this point) done business with any
of these suppliers and have no information about their trustworthiness,
reliability, or ability to deliver the products they claim to sell.

For this purpose, you should know what equipment I'm using.  I've got
a sun Sparcstation (Pizza box) with a 19 inch monitor (HUGE, 90 lbs), and
external (shoebox) hard disk, tape drive, and CD units.  All of this
equipment is set on a 30 inch be 60 inch table that is 30 inches high.
I'm using the table "sideways,~ meaning that I sit at the head of the table
with the keyboard in front of me, the monitor and pizza box behind the
keyboard, and way down at the other end of the table, I have the shoebox
units.

I'd like to have a table which was about 27 inches high with an adjustable
keyboard and mouse shelf.  The table should be at least 36 inches deep (or
face into a corner), and it needs to be wide enough that I can have
papers and such on either side of the keyboard.  It would be nice to be able
to put the shoebox equipment on a shelf or some such _under_ the table top
(to preserve table space and reduce noise).

First, some comments on "good" computer furniture.  Generally, it is accepted
that keyboard heights should be in the range of 26.5 to 29 inches.  This
means that whatever you have, it's too high.  Many computer tables have some
sort of shelf, stand, or table which raises the monitor.  I think that this
is a real mistake, as you end up hunched forward with your neck tilted back
in order to see the screen.  This is particularly painful if you wear
bifocals (I'm told).  Virtually all modern monitors offer some kind of tilt
and swivel, so for the furniture to provide this functionality is usually
redundant and silly.

Many computers (such as mine) require a vast amount of table depth - I'm using
about 44 inches.  One solution to this problem to to design a "corner" type
workstation which is designed to be placed facing into a corner with the
users back to the room.  This is a convenient way to create the required
depth, and work tables can be placed on either side of the corner unit
for a great deal of usable work area.  However, you can't see anyone come
into your office (your back is to the door), and I would expect that there
would be a possibility of severe glare problems (it's hard to move the screen
around to get rid of glare).

The furniture, sources, and my comments
---------------------------------------

1) Bretford Mobile workstations

  These are basically a set of tubular frames carts on casters.  Most of these
  place the monitor on a shelf above the keyboard surface.  The only one that
  doesn't is basically a desk on wheels except that it is only 24 inches deep.
  It is, however 26.5 inches high.  Prices run from $223 to $370.

2) Communicore CAD system

  This is a "corner" type workstation - designed to be placed facing into a
  corner with the users back to the room.  All units are 26.5 inches high and
  the extension tables are 30 inches deep.  The workstation extension tables
  have an under-table storage shelf.  Basically, you have the corner unit,
  the "plain" extension table, and the "tilting" extension table (useful
  for working from prints or other large paper).  Additionally, there is
  something called a "workstation" which is neither shown in the picture
  that I have, nor described in the text.  Prices run from $225 for a
  36w x 30d x 26.5h "workstation" (also available in 60w for $304) to $345
  for the 66w x 52d x 26.5h corner workstation.  A basic setup (corner
  workstation, layout table and extension) would run about $900.  The flaws
  with this are in the area of accessories - no drawer space, and no over
  work-surface shelf space (for manuals, not monitors).

3) Ergotron

  This is a line of "ergonomic" workstations and "dense pack" racks for network
  installations.  Basically, you buy a frame which can be fitted with legs,
  legs with casters, or attached to the wall.  The top of this frame is about
  70-78 inches above the floor; near the top is an adjustable shelf.  To the
  bottom of the shelf is attached a "truck" which holds the monitor, allowing
  for the monitor to slide from side to side, tilt, or swivel.  A "swing-arm"
  version of the monitor truck is available as well; this allows the monitor to
  be repositioned more freely.  The frame can be fitted with a work surface
  (to which a keyboard holder can be attached) or with a digitizer support
  frame.  Keyboard trays are also available to fit directly to the monitor
  suspension truck.  No undertable storage is provided, although there is a
  CPU caddy which attaches to the side of the unit.  Side tables, pencil boxes,
  and print holders are also available.  Frame prices run from $160 (for a
  wall mount unit) to $300 for a freestanding unit.  Shelves run $250;
  monitor suspension from $200 to $425, and legs from $78 to $800.  Keyboard
  trays can run as high as $300, and CPU holders from $100 to $250.

  Eagan, MN 55121
  1-800-888-8458


4) Hon computer furniture (66000 series)

  This is essentially a set of tables which match one another.  Under table
  storage is limited to a center pencil drawer or a center keyboard drawer,
  either of which can be mounted to the task desk (which has no keyboard
  shelf).  Cable management is provided.  The keyboard shelf is a cutout/
  dropdown; it's not clear if it is adjustable.  My guess is not.  The
  following table types are available:

  Table with center keyboard shelf (30 deep by 36 or 48 wide)
  Table with right or left keyboard shelf (30 deep by 60 wide)
  Task desk (30 by 60)
  Printer Stand (36w x 30d x 26.5h) with paper feed slot.
  Return (42w x 20d x 26.5h) freestanding.

  Cost is from $300 for the Typing Return to $500 for the table with keyboard
  shelf.

5) Image Setter Workstation

  This is a pretty complete modular workstation.  It includes tables
  with and without keyboard cutouts, tilting tables, tilting light
  tables, corner units, keyboard trays, CPU racks, mobile files,
  drawers, and overhead storage.  They also have connector parts
  that allow two tables to be connected together in a corner
  to form a corner workstation.

6) Mayline/Hamilton

  There are two lines of furniture from Mayline/Hamilton:
  The Creativity Corner line is similar to the Communicore cad system.  The
  table height for this system is not listed in my catalog.  There is a corner
  unit with under table storage and a "reference desk" with under table storage.
  The adjustable table seems to be adjustable for height, and it looks as if
  the reference desk top can be tilted.  The adjustable table has no under
  table storage.  There are drawer (pencil and storage) and shelf (hutch)
  accessories for the reference table and a corner shelf (for the monitor -
  yuck) for the corner unit.  Costs run from $256 for a 36w x 30d reference
  desk to $512 for the tilt top adjustable table.  Hutches are about $200, 
  corner shelf $118, two drawer unit $215, keyboard/pencil drawer $91.
  A basic setup (Adjustable table, reference table, and corner unit) would
  run $1150; with pencil drawer, storage drawer and hutch it would run $1650.

  The CADCorner units from Mayline Hamilton are similar to the creativity
  corner units.  All units are 29 inches high (too high!!), but they come in
  both 30 inch and 36 inch depths.  No under table shelf space is provided,
  but a two drawer storage unit can be got for $336.  Rather than a full
  hutch, a bookshelf is available (8h x 12d).  A 20 inch wide keyboard
  drawer is available (where am I to put my mouse?), as is a two drawer
  storage unit.  Prices range from $400 for a basic 36w x 30d x 29h desk
  to $760 for the 36d corner unit.  A setup with the 36d corner unit,
  a 36w desk, a 60w desk, a bookshelf, a two drawer storage unit and
  a keyboard drawer runs about $2200.

7) Tiffany Office Furniture

  This is a line of stands and carts; there is a basic workstation cart (mobile
  bilevel table) for about $450 and a more elaborate but smaller cart (less
  available workspace for $400.  The smaller cart has space under it for a
  printer.  The stands consist of towers on pedestals with casters;  The monitor
  sits on a stand atop the tower, the keyboard on a tray clamped to the tower
  and the cpu unit on a bracket at the base.

  Tiffany also makes a line of terminal stands; these are simply small tables
  on pedestals with casters.  Prices range from $200 for a simple table to
  $320 for a very adjustable table.  Larger units are available too.

  The smaller cart may work for what I need if the keyboard tray will adjust
  out from the table far enough; the keyboard tray is a little too narrow
  for my keyboard and mouse together (stupid optical mice!  The only thing
  worse is a mechanical mouse; think I'll get a trackball).  There is no
  workspace on this thing, but I could put it right next to a table.

8) Ultra View, Ultra View Plus, and Ergo Pro workstations

  In overall appearance, these units are similar to many "particle board
  covered with vinyl veneer" type computer workstations.  However, these
  have the computer monitor on a recessed tilted shelf, so the monitor is
  angled up toward the operator.  Unfortunately, they'll only handle
  monitors as large as 14"h 24"w 21"d.

  24d x 48w or 30d x 48w; the monitor surface is 18d x 48w.  The two surfaces
  can be tilted and elevated independently; adjustment range is 27.5 to 42.5h
  for the monitor table and 26h to 41h for the keyboard surface.  Price runs
  from $2915 to $4052, depending on which of the lift and tilt operations
  are manual vs electrical and depending on table size.

10) WorkManager System

  This is a line of tables, corner units, dividers and accessories which can
  be configured in a number of different ways - corner units, clustered
  workstations, lab workstations, etc.  They have a clean, futuristic look
  to them that I like; others may not.  No undertable storage is provided
  except on the printer stand; roll-under type storage units and undertable
  brackets for CPU's are available.  No table heights are given in my
  descriptions.  There are corner units with keyboard shelves (where am I
  supposed to put my mouse?), tables 34, 48, and 60 inches wide, a tilt top
  table, printer stand, and laser printer stand with supplies storage.  Prices
  run about $300 to $350 per desk or corner unit; printer stand is $200,
  underdesk file cabinet is $200.
