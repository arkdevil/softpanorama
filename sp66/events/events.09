IEEE 1994 Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference
October 30-November 5, 1994 (MIC November 3-5)
Waterside Convention Center, Norfolk, Virginia

The purpose of the Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS) is to advance the
field of nuclear science by publishing recent scientific advances, offering
instruction on specialized topics, and providing an opportunity for technical
discussion.

The purpose of the Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) is to provide a
forum for fundamental theoretical and applied contributions to the physics,
engineering, and mathematical aspects of medical imaging. This conference
will provide the opportunity for an exchange of ideas and recent
achievements in medical imaging.

EARLY REGISTRATION is strongly recommended to save
both money and time. Register by mail, FAX, or
electronically and pay in full by October 20 to take
