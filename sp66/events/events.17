THE IMPACT OF RETAIL COMPETITION
ON THE ELECTRIC MARKETS

                                San Diego, CA  September 29-30, 1994

Plus, an optional Short Course on "Managomg the Utility in Times of
Change" is offered on Wednesday, Septemeber 28, 1994.

Focus on State and Federal Regulatory Priorities, Stranded Investment
and Unbundling

An Executive Conference Sponsored by The Energy Daily, a publication
sponsored by King Publishing Group, Washington, D.C.

((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
Join our expert faculty for a powerful two-day conference to discuss:

       -      How to avoid the stranded asset quandary.
       -      Performance-based ratemaking.
       -      New products through unbundling of services.
       -      What is brewing in all state commissions.
       -      FERC's new comparability tariff standard.
       -      Key jurisdictional issues between the states and FERC.
       -      How the major utilities are planning for the future.
       -      FERC's  3rd and 4th quarter plans for 1994.
       -      SCE's "PoolCo" proposal and how it differs from other power pools.

       1993 was largely a year of transition, as FERC moved with
uncharacteristic speed to implement the provisions of the Energy
Policy Act.  In 1994, few were surprised as FERC again shifted gears
and set its sights on restructuring the industry.
       Already we've seen proposals on stranded costs, deregulated
power sales, transmission pricing, and service comparability
standards.
       However, the most significant body of proposed regulation this
year -- or since the passage of the EPAct of 1992 for that matter --
was not issued by Washington, but rather from the California Public
Utilities Commission; the "blue book"on industry deregulation.  While
many industry observers have praised these recent developments in
market deregulation, questions remain about the limits of regulatory
jurisdiction.
       FERC and the states rarely, if ever, have seen eye-to-eye.  But
they now are trying to coordinate the crafting of policies that will
help lead electric utilities into the competitive era.
       In sum, critical issues that unless quickly resolved or, at the
very least, defined, will set the industry's competitive future back
for years, meaning millions of dollars in lost time and investment.
       Over a two day period, The Energy Daily's senior utility
faculty will discuss in great detail their assessments of the current
regulatory climate, innovative industry approaches to the new
competitive regimes, and their visions for how to capitalize on the
new competitive marketplace.
       In many ways, the current period for the electric industry is
similar to 1985 for the gas industry. As they did in the mid-eighties,
industry incumbents are now emphasizing reliability issues,
uncompensated services, new product development and, above all,
protecting market share.
       The Energy Daily's conference, "The Impact of Retail
Competition on the Electric Utility Industry" will explore these
issues through a series of intensive panel discussions and formal
presentations by some of the industry's leading authorities on
deregulation, pricing, new product development and strategic planning.

                                  MANAGING THE UTILITY IN TIMES OF CHANGE

       This course is designed for utility senior managers who want to explore the requirements imposed by
today's changing utility environment. The seminar will be conducted by Llewellyn King, publisher of "The
Energy Daily" and a recognized expert and long-time lecturer on energy subjects. Attendees will learn how
to capitalize on opportunities and minimize risks.

                     Course Outline for WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1994, 9:00AM - 5:00PM

Restructuring the Utility
       Many ~gurus~ claim to have the only business plan that will succeed in positioning a utility for
       success today, but the problems defy simplistic solutions.
       - Identifying the core business.
       - What determines which units are worth saving.
       - Which keepers are compatible with the core business.
       - Advantages and drawbacks in ~hiving off~ units.
       - What lessons can we learn from deregulated
          industries.

The Media and Utilities
       Dealing with the media is the most important element of a utility~s public image.
       - How the media works and what drives it.
       - How to make friends with the local media.
       - How to get the maximum out of the news you generate.
       - What are the most important things to do in a crisis.

LUNCHEON:  Management Roundtable Discussions
       - Find out what the others are doing.
       - What works and what doesn~t.
       - How have others reacted to your problems.

Risk Management for Utilities
       It is too late to worry about risk after the damage is done. Utilities must look at their risk equations
       and plan for contingencies.
       - The consequences of technological risks.
       - Public policy as the greatest potential risk.
       - Doing your political homework.
       - Educating the public and the PUCs.


The Utility "Hot Buttons" for 1995 and Beyond
       Utilities will survive if they position themselves to deal with the major issues and to take advantage
       of opportunities in the new utility environment.
       - EMF: The reality vs. the public perception
       - Driving diversification in new generation.
       - Converting rate payer into customers.
       - What "the customer is always right" means to a utility.
       - How new technology will develop as utilities break up.
       - Biting the bullet on stranded investment.
       - The role of futures and derivatives in utility finances.
       - Opportunities in common carrier access.
