Announces a Non-Credit Course on Client/Server Computing


IMPLEMENTING OPEN CLIENT/SERVER TECHNOLOGIES
September 8-9, 1994


Implementing Open Client/Server Technologies is a two-day course that
introduces open systems technologies with a focus on migration and
integration issues. The course assumes that participants are either
planning a client/server deployment or are actually implementing
cleint/server systems. The course identifies technical barriers to
successful client/server implementations and offers strategies for
resolving these impediments.

This course applies technical concepts to a case study environment,
either an Open Software Foundation-provided example or the client's own.

Featured Topics
-------------------
* Identifying key integration barriers to achieving open client/server
implentations
* Describing the three-tiered logical software model and how it relates
to physical networked systems
* Pinpointing leading available technologies for implementing open
cliient/server technologies
* Determining critical concerns in procuring open client/server
technologies
* Discussing management issues in changing to open client/server
technologies
