There are so many conferences on Information Superhighway these days.
What is the disticnt aspect of this conference? The organizers spend
a lot of time designing the program so that the conference addresses
issues that affect you directly, such as what the electronic
superhighway looks like in Silicon Vally, the place where you live;
what is PacBell's pricing and direction, the company to which you pay
your monthly telecomm bills; the market and business opportunities in
the online information industries for you as an entrepreneur; and how
can you do business on the Internet.

We are lucky to have invited four well-known experts, Dr. Harry Saal,
Dr. Frank Liu, Dr. Lisa Thorell, and Mr. Randy Adams in the online
information industries to share their vision and information with you.
We know that this conference is for YOU. Come and join us on Sept. 10,
at Marriot Hotel in Santa Clara.
