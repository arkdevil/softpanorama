		WDC 95 - A 2-DAY CONFERENCE ON
		 WIRELESS DATA COMMUNICATIONS

	  VANCOUVER, B.C. CANADA, 26-27 JANUARY, 1995

Wireless Data Communications technologies, products and systems
have been the recipients of billions of dollars of investment in
recent years.  The take-up of available product and service has
not, however, been particularly record-breaking.

This conference will address the many forms and applications of
wireless data communications in two specific contexts:

	+ existing and near-term products, systems and
	  applications will be described for the benefit
	  of potential users, system integrators and
	  application developers

	+ the impact of deregulation, competition, and
	  new services within the telecommunications in-
	  dustry, and the coming of the "information
	  highway" will be discussed and summarized by
	  some of the most respected visionaries in the
	  wireless telecommunications industry, so that
	  system users, planners and developers alike may
	  gain a better appreciation for the issues and
	  consequences of this rapid evolution.

PRESENTATION TOPICS:

The agenda has been selected to provide the necessary decision-
making background to allow potentials users to select strategies
and products for wireless implementations, and to bring users,
developers and "visionaries" together so that all may be more aware
of the impact of wireless on the future of communications and the
information highway.

The following topical areas will be addressed at the conference:

~    Infrastructure and Service Provider Facilities
~    Applications and Value-added Services
~    Subscriber and User Equipment
~    Mobility and Workgroup Issues
~    Future Protocol and Application Requirements
~    Information Highway "On-ramps" and Related Issues

PRESENTERS AND KEY SPEAKERS:

Despite the fact that the Vancouver area is one of the strongest
centers of North American wireless communications technology and
products, Canada (questionably) lags the U.S. and other nations in
the deployment of new techologies, for reasons usually associated
with economics, our diverse geograpy, and telecommunications
regulation.
We are pleased to be able to draw upon the experience of a number
of prominent pioneers and visionaries from both countries, and will
feature 30-40 experts in their respective fields at the conference.

A few of the better-known "gurus" that will be present are:

~    Mr. Geoffrey Goodfellow, founder of Radiomail Inc., and an
     early pioneer in wireless datacomm during his days at SRI
~    Dr. Ira Brodsky, President of Datacomm Research, and a
     respected consultant in wireless communications issues
~    Mr. Phil Karn, aka KA9Q, currently with Qualcomm Inc., and an
     icon outside the professional community for his major
     contributions to and through amateur radio packet
     communications technology
~    Mr. Alan Reiter, editor of the industry publication Mobile
     Data Report, and a seasoned RoadWarrior
~    Mr. Jim Page of Motorola, who has been responsible for much of
     the success and evolution of alpha-numeric paging in North
     America, over many years in the business - in product-
     development and system operations alike
~    Mr. George Squires, Vice President of TRLabs, Calgary, under
     whose direction that organization's Calgary Wireless Lab has
     strongly advanced the state of wireless technologies

WHO SHOULD ATTEND AND WHY?

Technical literacy is NOT a requirement for attendance at this
conference.

The objectives are:

~    To provide those outside of the mainstream with an
     appreciation and understanding of the nature and issues
     surrounding the major wireless systems and applications of the
     day, focusing on "look and feel"

~    To provide a forum for exchanges of ideas between network,
     product and application providers, and the major implementers
     and users of these commodities, so that product developers may
     generate successful new devices and programs, and so users and
     planners can better understand what is available, what is
     evolving, and the how best to plan for optimal wireless use.

Specifically, attendees who might derive the most value from the
conference are:

~    MIS and telecommunications managers and specialists
~    Corporate management
~    Telecommunications and utility firms; government ministries
     and agencies
~    Software applications developers
~    Wireless Datacomm product developers
~    Engineering consultants and System Integrators
~    Academic researchers doing work in advanced protocols and
     applications
THE VENUE....

Vancouver is located a little over 2 hours drive north of Seattle,
and enjoys (almost always) a moderate, snow-free January climate
while offering some of the world's best skiing and other recreation
within "day trip" range.

The Landmark Hotel, which will be home to most activities, is
located in the heart of the cosmopolitan Robson Street shopping
boutique area, and is also convenient in terms of it's proximity to
other visitor facilities.
