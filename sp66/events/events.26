        AISB-95: CALL FOR WORKSHOP AND TUTORIAL PROPOSALS
        -------------------------------------------------

             Call for Workshop Proposals: AISB-95

                 University of Sheffield,
                    Sheffield, England

                    April 3 -- 4, 1995

                   Society for the Study of
      Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour (SSAISB)


The AISB Committee invites proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction
with the Tenth Biennial Conference on AI and Cognitive Science (AISB-95).
While the main conference will run for three days from Wednesday, April 5 to
Friday, April 7, the workshops will be held on the two days preceding the main
event: Monday, April 3 and Tuesday, April 4.

The main conference has the theme "Hybrid Problems, Hybrid Solutions" (see the
main conference call) and while proposals for workshops related to that theme
would be particularly welcome, proposals are invited for workshops relating
to any aspect of Artificial Intelligence or the Simulation of Behaviour.

Proposals, from an individual or a pair of organisers, for workshops between
0.5 and 2 days long will be considered. Workshops will probably address topics
which are at the forefront of research, but not yet sufficiently developed to
warrant a full-scale conference.

 Submission:
 ----------
 A workshop proposal should contain the following information:

 1. Workshop Title

 2. A detailed outline of the workshop.
    This should include the necessary background and the potential
    target audience for the workshop and a justified estimate of the
    number of possible attendees. Please also state the length and
    preferred date(s) of the workshop. Specify any equipment requirements,
    indicating whether the organisers would be expected to meet them.

 3. A brief resume of the organiser(s).
    This should include: background in the research area,
    references to published work in the topic area and relevant
    experience, such as previous organisation or chairing of
    workshops.

 4. Administrative information.
    This should include: name, mailing address, phone number, fax, and
    email address if available.  In the case of multiple organisers,
    information for each organiser should be provided, but one organiser
    should be identified as the principal contact.

 5. A draft Call for Participation.
    This should serve the dual purposes of informing and attracting
    potential participants.


 The organisers of accepted workshops are responsible for issuing a call for
 participation, reviewing requests to participate and scheduling the workshop
 activities within the constraints set by the Workshop Organiser. They are
 also responsible for submitting a collated set of papers for their workshop
 to the Workshop Organiser.

 Dates:
 ------
 Intentions to organise a workshop should be made known to the
 Workshop Organiser as soon as possible.

 Proposals must be received by October 18th 1994.
 Decisions about topics and speakers will be made in early November.
 Collated sets of papers to be received by March 15th 1995.

 Proposals should be sent to:

    Dr. Robert Gaizauskas
    Department of Computer Science
    University of Sheffield
    211 Portobello Street
    Regent Court
    Sheffield S1 4DP
    U.K.

    email:  robertg@dcs.shef.ac.uk
    phone:  +44 (0)742 825572
    fax:    +44 (0)742 780972

Electronic submission (plain ascii text) is highly preferred, but
hard copy submission is also accepted, in which case 5 copies should
be submitted. Proposals should not exceed 2 sides of A4 (i.e. 120
lines of text approx.).

             Call for Tutorial Proposals: AISB-95

                 University of Sheffield,
                    Sheffield, England

                   Society for the Study of
      Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour (SSAISB)


The AISB Committee invites proposals for Tutorials to be held in conjunction
with the Tenth Biennial Conference on AI and Cognitive Science (AISB-95).
While the main conference will run for three days from Wednesday, April 5 to
Friday, April 7, the tutorials will be held on the two days preceding the main
event: Monday, April 3 and Tuesday, April 4.

Proposals for full and half day tutorials, from an individual or pair of
presenters, will be considered. They may be offered both on standard topics
and on new and more advanced aspects of Artificial Intelligence or Simulation
of Behaviour. Anyone interested in presenting a tutorial should submit a
proposal to the Workshop Organiser Dr Robert Gaizauskas (addresses below).

 Submission:
 ----------
 A tutorial proposal should contain the following
 information:

 1. Tutorial Title

 2. A brief description of the tutorial, suitable for inclusion in
    a brochure.

 3. A detailed outline of the tutorial.
    This should include the necessary background and the potential
    target audience for the tutorial and a justified estimate of the
    number of possible attendees. Please also state the length and
    preferred date(s) of the tutorial. Specify any equipment requirements,
    indicating whether the organisers would be expected to meet them.

 4. A brief resume of the presenter(s).
    This should include: background in the tutorial area,
    references to published work in the topic area and relevant
    experience. Published work should, ideally, include a published
    tutorial-level article on the subject. Relevant experience
    is teaching experience, including previous conference tutorials
    or short courses presented.

 5. Administrative information.
    This should include: name, mailing address, phone number, fax, and
    email address if available.  In the case of multiple presenters,
    information for each presenter should be provided, but one presenter
    should be identified as the principal contact.

 The presenter(s) of accepted tutorials must submit a set of
 tutorial notes (which may include relevant tutorial-level
 publications) to the Workshop Organisers by March 15th 1995.
