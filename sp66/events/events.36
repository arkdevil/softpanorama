Foreword

Although many distributed multimedia applications now exist as pilot
projects on local networks, these prototypes have yet to be translated
into realistic applications running over large scale heterogeneous high-speed
networks. To help bring about this important transition, a number of
initiatives such as the COST 237 Multimedia Telecommunications Services
project in Europe and the Multimedia Communications Forum in the US
have recently been established. These groups identify a lack of generic
system support as the primary technological factor holding back the
deployment of realistic, large scale, distributed multimedia applications.
There are two basic technologies required to make feasible such support: an
appropriate transport service for communications needs, and a suitable set
of generic multimedia teleservices to provide a framework for application
development.

It is now accepted that significant enhancements to existing transport
services are needed to adequately support large scale distributed
multimedia applications. In particular, the transport service must be
extended to support quality of service configurability and multicast/
multipeer connectivity, and must be supported by a variety of high-speed
network architectures. The area of multimedia teleservices is equally
crucial. Generic high level services, such as multimedia enhanced email,
conferencing frameworks and shared application frameworks, are necessary
to ease the evolution from present day pilot applications to commercial,
inter-operable, products. The workshop will address both of these
technological areas with particular attention paid to the integration of
the two. The emphasis of the workshop will be on service and
architectural aspects of distributed multimedia application support from
the transport layer upwards.

In total, 46 papers were received from 14 countries. Following the
review procedure, the program committee selected 18 papers to be presented at
the workshop, and 6 papers to be presented at a poster/demo session to
be held at the workshop.
Two well known invited speakers will complete the workshop program.

This workshop is organised by the CEC COST 237 Multimedia Telecommunications
Services Project and hosted by Alcatel Austria AG.
It is particularly pleasing to be able to hold this first COST 237 Workshop
in Vienna, a communications and cultural centre in Europe for so many
centuries and the capital of the most recent country to agree to join the
European Union. Vienna was the residence of the Habsburg Dynasty and is still
a modern metropolis at the heart of Europe. It is one of the three centres
of the United Nations and one of the most sought-after conference venues
anywhere in the world.

Looking forward to meeting you at the COST237 workshop'94 in Vienna.

David Hutchison, Lancaster University, Conference Chairman

St. Stephan's Cathedral. It is within easy walking distance of both Hotels.


Workshop Dinner

Vienna is not only celebrated as one of the centers of European history,
culture, music and architecture, it is also famous for its "heuriger" -
a form of wine tavern unique to Vienna which has evolved due to the close
proximity of vineyards to the city. The new wine served at the heuriger
is also known as heuriger; after Martinmas (11th of November) the heuriger
wine becomes an "alter" (old) wine. The majority of the Viennese
vineyards are on the slopes of Kahlenberg and Nussberg located to the north
of Vienna. The better known wine-growing districts such as Grinzing,
Sievering and Neustift can also be found in this area.

Our Workshop Dinner will celebrate the heuriger and will be held in the
romantic and rural district of Neustift.

The transportation from the Hotels will be arranged by the Workshop
Organisers. Please confirm your attendance at the dinner along with your
Workshop registration.
