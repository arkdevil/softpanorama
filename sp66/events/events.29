			CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

			       PASCO'94

		     First International Symposium

		     Parallel Symbolic Computation

		September 26 -- 28, 1994 Linz - Austria

=======================================================================

The First International Symposium on Parallel Symbolic Computation
(PASCO'94) will be devoted communicating significant developments
in all the areas pertinent to  ``Parallel Symbolic Computation''.

The interplay between parallelism and symbolic computation poses
inspiring scientific challenges, which deserve much focused attention.
However, there has not yet been a dedicated forum, and this symposium
addresses the need.

It is also expected that further progress can be made through the
interaction between parallel symbolic algorithm designers and parallel
high-level language designers.  This symposium is intended to provide
a framework for establishing this fruitful dialogue.



Location
--------
The symposium will take place in the beautiful Castle of Hagenberg, a
medieval castle which was renovated recently and now houses RISC-Linz,
the Research Institute for Symbolic Computation.  The village of
Hagenberg is located in the hilly countryside of the M"uhlviertel,
about 25 km from Linz, the capital of Upper Austria.

Linz has an international airport and is on the main train and
highway connection to Vienna.  A shuttle service from Linz to
Hagenberg will be provided by the conference organizers.


Publication
-----------
Proceedings:	Will be published by ``World Scientific Publishing''.
		They will be available to participants at the meeting.

Journal:	Several high quality papers will appear as a special
		issue of the Journal of Symbolic Computation (JSC),
		which is planned to appear in early 1995.


Registration
------------
The early registration fee (until August 31) is ATS 3000.--, late
registration fee is ATS 3600.--.  This includes all talks, the
proceedings, 3 lunches, coffee/tea/soft drinks and cakes for the
coffee breaks, the conference dinner, and the shuttle service from
the hotels to the conference location and back.
