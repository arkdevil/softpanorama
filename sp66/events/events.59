Evaluation of computer-based instruction

Interactive instruction is not an end in itself; the real goal  is
improving   learning  and  performance.   This  workshop   teaches
practical  strategies  for evaluating the effectiveness  (Do  They
Learn?)   and   impact  (Does  It  Matter?)  of   technology-based
instructional systems.  Workshop participants will learn  how  to:
Prepare  practical evaluation plans for interactive  instructional
systems;  Identify  and/or develop reliable and  valid  evaluation
instruments,  including  tests,  questionnaires,  interviews,  and
observation  protocols; Implement evaluation plans  in  a  timely,
accurate,  and  cost-efficient manner; Prepare evaluation  reports
that make a difference.

WORKSHOP 4

Dr James Kraatz, University of Illinois, USA

Multimedia and video production

The  emphasis of this full day workshop will be on familiarization
with  current  sound  and video hardware and  software  multimedia
resources.  Workshop participants will participate in the assembly
of  a  multimedia  workstation and  they  will  develop  a  sample
multimedia  lesson  including digital audio and  video  sequences.
CDROM  and  other lesson materials will be demonstrated  and  made
available  for trial.  This workshop will be presented on  IBM  MS
