SPIE Educational Short Course Programs are offered in response to
an ever-present need for training in the technical areas of
optics, visual communications, and image processing. SPIE short
courses (SC) are designed to present overviews of current
research and recent developments, while providing attendees with
references and ideas on how to apply the information to their
work. These courses were organized to stand alone or to complement
the topical meetings and presentations at SPIE's Visual
Communications and Image Processing '94.
