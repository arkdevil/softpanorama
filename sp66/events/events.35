                        THE SEMINAR SERIES


In recent years it has become clear that  in many new application areas,
conventional database management systems (DBMSs) only provide limited
possibilities. Engineering, for instance, does not yet fully benefit from DBMS
technology. World-wide, researchers and developers are now active in providing
this new functionality along several different approaches (e.g. extended
relational, semantic or object oriented approach). Numerous prototypes of new
generation DBMSs have appeared. From a consumer's point of view the question
is: "Which approach should I choose, and next, which system should I choose ?".
There are no simple answers to these questions, since too many factors are
involved.


To keep you informed of the latest practical advances in DBMSs for "new"
applications, last year the Database Systems  (DBS) group of Mrs. prof.dr.ir.
W. Gerhardt-Hackl at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) decided
to start a series of annual seminars, entitled "Modern Developments in Database
Systems - Science and Technology". Representatives of the international R&D
community, invited from a variety of well known institutions, will talk about
the state of the art developments in methodologies, systems, standards,
techniques, etc. and will be available for discussion.


The seminars alternately focus on concepts one year and emphasize on
applications  the other year. Last year the main program dealt with various
aspects of object-DBMS (ODBMS) concepts, as viewed by prof. K. Dittrich
and his group (Univ. Zurich).




    THE 1994 SEMINAR



Next to developments of general interest, the '94 seminar "Database Systems and
Applications for the Nineties" will focus on engineering applications. The
speakers are from France (O2 Technology),  Germany (GMD, IBM, SNI), the
Netherlands (BitByBit, Philips, Syllogic, TU Delft) and the USA (IBM). All are
active in the development area and, therefore, closely connected with the needs
of industrial and other users. Among the topics covered are:

- providing DBMS functionality to the programmer
- optimization
- distribution
- interoperability
- frameworks
- standards

The first day is dedicated to technological advances in general. The second day
emphasizes on frameworks (a framework can be considered an extension to a DBMS
that provides complete support for engineering applications, e.g. design and
process flow management, and project management). The speakers on the second
day have a common base: they have been involved in shaping the largest European
project in this area (JESSI Common Framework), intended to make the European
Community the world leader in framework technology.

    ABSTRACTS

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Standards in CAD Frameworks


    E. Abel


The standards of the international CAD Framework Initiative (CFI) focus on the
interoperability between CAD tools as well as between different CAD systems.

The first set of CFI standards, published in January 1993, addresses basic
design environment software (e.g. networking services), design representation
supporting basic netlist manipulation, inter-tool communication providing
messaging among tools, and basic techniques for describing tool encapsulation
information.

CFI aims to adopt existing and industry accepted standards and to concentrate
its efforts on those areas that specifically require new standards. If CFI can
successfully address the issue of interoperability, customers will be
provided with a better design data flow and open environment that lower their
design costs and improve their own tool selection.

In the presention these matters will be discussed, and the advantages for the
user will be shown.

    Managing Distributed Client/Server Databases Sites


    P.W. Adriaans


Many organizations are turning to client/server computing. In a lot of cases
this means that large database applications are distributed over a number of
smaller systems. The management of such a site is very complex and confronts
the database administrator with a set of unprecedented problems.

In this talk I will discuss a number of issues on a conceptual level:
client/server architectures, distributed database architectures, implications
for management, performance, replication, tuning, software development and
security.

    O2, an ODMG Compliant Object Database System


    F. Bancilhon


The ODMG standard was established in 1993 and 1994 by a group of five object
database vendors. Since then major actors such as Sybase, HP, EDS and Andersen
Consulting have joined the group.

The standard defines an object data model, an object definition language, ODL,
an object query language, OQL, and language bindings for C++ and Smalltalk.

The O2 object database system consists of an efficient database
engine together with a complete set of tools. These include an ODMG compliant
C++ interface and an OQL interpreter and optimizer.

    Application of Framework Technology in System Simulation Environments


    P. Bingley


Outside the electronics world CAD has focussed mainly on developing point tools
for simulating specific (physical) phenomena. These tools are essential in
designing up-to-spec-components for products (= systems). However, these tools
are often not suited for determining the overall performance of a product that
is made up of individual components. The need for this keeps increasing, due to
the growing importance of cost effectively supporting multi-disciplinary design
teams in overall product optimization.

We aim at: (1) making the point tools widely available by placing them in a
single environment that provides uniform user interaction and integral
management of design data, (2) combining the physical models for the components
into a model for the complete system that aids in evaluating the overall
performance of the system. We find framework technology to be an important
vehicle for realizing these goals.

    Coupling of Heterogeneous Databases by Federation Services


    G. Kachel


Nowadays, enterprises use multiple heterogeneous databases. Due to enterprise
integration a necessity arises to couple these databases for realizing global
applications using more than one database.

A first solution outline of an object-oriented approach is given. This solution
allows the autonomous coupling of heterogeneous databases by so-called Database
Federation Services. Besides federation, non-autonomous coupling as well as
migration of tools and data in heterogeneous database environments are offered.

Architecture as well as implementation aspects are discussed. The relation to
an R and D area called "Middleware" is presented. Conclusions for the use of
Database Federation Services are given.

    SIFRAME - Concurrent Engineering Framework Based on OODBMS

    T. Kathofer


The SIFRAME framework is a program package into which individual applications
can be integrated for across-the-board optimization of process management in
the areas of organization, development, and production. It can be used to
configure, execute, and manage complex multi-user design projects.

The framework uses design flow mechanisms to define, monitor, and combine
activities. Activities can be assigned to tools or individual functions of
tools integrated into the system. Projects can be defined by assigning users
or user groups with appropriate design flows to the projects. The framework
enables several users to work simultaneously on a project  and ensures the
consistency of the data. Data consistency is ensured by the underlying Object
Management System (OMS). The OMS offers a complete object-oriented database
system combined with a traditional relational database system. This innovative
combination allows for object-oriented access to relational data and vice
versa.

In this paper an overview of the functionality and design of the framework is
presented.

    Methodology Tools for Engineering Environments


    T.G.R. van Leuken


In the EDA world design management tools have been available for some time.
They include version management, concurrent access procedures and others.

This presentation will be directed to methodology management tools, which are
in the transfer stage from research tool to commercial tool. These tools can
have a major impact on a company when they are utilized, because they require
a precise description of the processes in the company (do you know them?) and
can result in a major reorganization of the company production process.

The utilization of the methodology tools will have a strong influence on the
company's staff behavior.

    Advanced Transaction Models


    C. Mohan


The  classical  transaction  concept has been widely adopted in academia and in
industry. This transaction model guarantees the ACID properties - atomicity,
consistency, isolation and durability. In these last few years, for
non-traditional applications like CAD/CAM, CASE, collaborative editing, etc.,
the traditional model has been found to be inadequate.

To address the unique requirements of such applications and also to model
business processes (workflow) which involve executing multiple interrelated
transactions, advanced  transaction models have been proposed. Some of the
latter are: Nested Transactions, Sagas, ConTract model, Flex Transaction model,
Split-Transactions, etc.

This tutorial reviews some of the above work and points out those issues that
have not been adequately addressed by the proponents of those transaction
models. An industrial and research perspective with implementation and
practicality goals will be provided.

    Interactions between Query Optimization and Concurrency Control


    C. Mohan


Work on query optimization has generally ignored considerations relating to
concurrency control in making query execution (access planning) choices.

In this talk we argue the importance of and need for taking into consideration
concurrency control related issues in making query optimization and query
processing decisions. Such considerations are very important not only for
attaining good performance, but also for assuring the correctness of the
results returned to the users under certain circumstances.

Some of the topics that we deal with include degrees of consistency or
isolation levels, lock escalation, blocking of results and use of multiple
indexes for a single table access. We identify some of the pieces of
information relating to locking that must be available to the optimizer for it
to make intelligent decisions. We also identify some situations in which
locking can be avoided by taking advantage of the isolation level of the query
being executed.

    Object Orientation in SQL3


    P. Pistor


Currently, standardization bodies (mainly ANSI and ISO) make considerable
efforts to turn SQL into a computationally complete object oriented programming
language, which is upward compatible with the current standard (ISO/IEC
9075:1992).

This presentation mainly addresses the new object oriented features of SQL,
and discusses how they meet the requirements of nonstandard applications.

    Providing DBMS Functionality to the Programmer -

    Using a Virtual Object Approach


    M.N. Sim , W. Gerhardt-Hackl ,

    P.M. Kist , N.E. Simon


Several approaches are known to minimize the impedance mismatch between
programming language (PL) and DB Application Programming Interface (API).

One direction is provided by Object Database Management Systems (ODBMS) which
should integrate DBMS capabilities with object-oriented (OO) programming
language capabilities.

We discuss an approach that follows this line but we extend  the properties of
an object to a virtual object. This enables us to develop an ODBMS of which the
API (unlike the ODMG-93 database standard) does not add extensions to the OOPL.
