KEYNOTE SPEAKERS
                            Peter Cochrane
Peter Cochrane is a graduate of Trent Polytechnic and Essex University.
He is currently a visiting professor to Essex, Southampton and Kent
Universities. He joined BT Laboratories in 1973 and has worked on both
analogue and digital switching and transmission. From 1988 he managed
the Long Lines Division where he was involved in the development of
intensity modulated and coherent optical systems, photonic amplifiers
and wavelength routed networks. In 1991 he established the Systems
Research Division and since 1993 has headed the Research Department at
BT Laboratories. He is also a Development Board Member for Technology
and has published widely in all areas of telecommunications studies.

                            James Harrison
James Harrison is currently involved in the investigation of
telemedicine architectures, standards and system components to provide
advanced communications functionality to clinically relevant
applications. This work is based around understanding what are
clinically adequate subsections of the patient record to provide the
necessary context for successful communication, and what the relevant
communication tasks associated with these subsections are.

He is also a leader of a co-operative European topic within the European
Commission AIM (Advanced Informatics in Medicine) programme,
investigating the clinical communication needs of radiologists and their
customers within a distributed hospital setting. He is the leader of the
technical implementation of a trial clinical system to validate the
concepts within a live clinical scenario.

                           Steinar Pedersen
Steinar Pedersen is the Head of the Department of Telemedicine at the
University Hospital of Tromso, one of the pioneering centres of
telemedicine in the world.

He gained his degree at the University of Oslo before taking up posts as
Resident in Otorhinolaryngology at Sentralsykehuset in Stavanger and at
the University Hospital of Tromso.

In addition to publishing a substantial number of papers on the subject
of Telemedicine, Steinar Pedersen was the Chairman of the First
International Conference on the Medical Aspects of Telemedicine in May
1993.

                             Marcelo Sosa
Marcelo Sosa works for the Commission of the European Communities, in DG
XIII's health care telematics programme (formerly AIM). Primarily
trained as a medical doctor, he has been involved in patient care in
both primary care and hospital settings for over a decade. He acquired
postgraduate qualifications in family and community medicine, and in
public health and health care administration. Later on he acquired
university training in informatics as an information systems manager. He
has served with the Spanish ministry of health, and has been involved in
teaching at the undergraduate and graduate level of medical and public
health students.

His main fields of interest have been in epidemiology and health
information systems, and he has been involved in designing, implementing
and using computer based systems and networks for clinical care,
management, education, and research for several years. He has served as
technical advisor to the national health authorities in Spain, and
conducted research and development projects. He has published many
articles in professional journals and three books.
