Summary: Applications of VR in science, social and engineering contexts.


                           CALL FOR PAPERS

               VIRTUAL REALITY IN SCIENCE & ENGINEERING

                   AT THE ROYAL SOCIETY, LONDON, UK

                         July 19 - 20, 1995


   A three day event for the scientific, engineering and medical
   communities with interactive presentations, demonstrations. An
   experience designed for both the expert and those entering this
   rapidly growing and important field.

   The event is intended to promote cross-discipline interest in
   the latest applications in VR and telepresence, including the
   human facing implications of VR.

   The event will demonstrate VR in science and engineering contexts,
   helping to position the subject as an established research,
   development and applications tool.

   Presenters are encouraged to introduce interactive and live
   demonstrations. Large screen projection facilities will be
   available with supporting sound systems and graphics computing
   platforms.

   It is anticipated that this non-commercial event will attract a
   high level of attention with an audience of leading academics, VR
   practitioners and the public.


   EVENT OUTLINE
   -------------

   The first two days of the event will consist of conference
   presentations of papers, divided into themes.

   The final day will provide a retrospective of the first two days
   of the event and provide a forum for cross-discipline discussion
   on VR.

   Day 1 - 19th July 1995
   VR in Medicine
   Social Impact of VR

   Day 2 - 20th July 1995
   VR in Telecommunications
