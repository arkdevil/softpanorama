      many diverse areas of expertise. General topics of  interest  in-
      clude but are not limited to:

 Speech Synthesis                                    Text-to-Speech Synthesis
 Acoustic Phonetics and Prosody                        Speech Signal Analysis
 Speech Databases                                      Voice Response Systems
 Speech Coding and Encryption                       Spoken Language Modelling
 Speaker Identification / Verification                Speaker Characteristics
 Speech Production                                         Speech Recognition
 Speech Processing using AI, ANN and advanced techniques
 Human Audition, Perception and Cognition
 Speech Disorders                             Human-Machine Speech Interfaces
 Aids for the Speech/Hearing Impaired          Speech Technology Applications

      This ensures that SST-94 is a true reflection of the  interdisci-
      plinary  nature of speech as an area of scientific and industrial
      endeavour. A Tutorial Day will be held on Monday, December  5  as
      an  introduction  to the important concepts in speech science and
      technology research. Keynote addresses will be given by Prof. Bob
      Linggard  from  the University of East Anglia and Dr. Anne Cutler
      from    the    Max-Planck-Institute    in    the     Netherlands.
