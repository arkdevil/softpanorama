           Organized by Depto.  de Ciencias de la Computaci'on

                          Universidad de Chile
                     Valpara'iso/Vi~na del Mar, Chile
             April 6--7, 1995 (held jointly with LATIN'95)


   The  purpose  of  the  Second  South  American  Workshop   on  String
Processing  is to  present current  and  on-going research  results  and
stimulate  the exchange  of  ideas  in  the area  of  string  processing
and its  applications.   This  meeting follows  the successful  workshop
organized by the Univ.   of Minas Gerais on September of 1993.   Typical
but not  exclusive topics  of interest include  text algorithms,  string
matching, biological sequence analysis, and information retrieval.
   Workshop Format:  The Workshop will concentrate on exchange  of ideas
of current  research through invited  talks, refereed presentations,  an
open problems session, and discussions of special topics.
   Submissions:  Send either  a Postscript file by  e-mail, a fax, or  a
hard copy  of an extended  abstract written in  English, no longer  than
ten pages or about 2,000 words, to the Program Chair
