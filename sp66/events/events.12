                Announcement and Call for Papers

                 HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING '95
             Grand Challenges in Computer Simulation
      (Part of the 1995 International Simulation Conference)

                          Sponsored by
               The Society for Computer Simulation

                    April 9-April 13, 1995
                 Crescent Hotel * Phoenix, Arizona

  The 1995 International Simulation Conference will feature the
Third Special Symposium devoted to the impact of High Performance
Computing on Computer Simulation. Topics to be addressed include:

         (1) high performance computing applications;
         (2) parallel algorithms and numerical methods;
         (3) methodologies to exploit HPC architectures and
             communication networks;
         (4) visualization and validation of large scale
             computer simulations.

  Prospective authors are invited to submit abstracts describing their
work in these areas.

  The goal of the Symposium is to encourage innovation in High
Performance Computing Technologies and to stimulate the use of
these technologies in key areas of Computer Simulation. It will
promote the exchange of ideas and information between universities,
industry, and national laboratories supporting the development
of High Performance Computing Applications which can provide solutions
to current scientific and technical challenges.
  High Performance Computing Applications of interest include (but are not
limited to):

          * 3-D Computational Fluid Dynamics Models
          * Combustion Systems simulation
          * Predictions of weather, climate, and global changes
          * Models of turbulence in fluid flows
          * Computational solid mechanics applications
          * Nuclear reactor safety analysis
          * Computational ocean sciences and systems
          * Automotive Applications
          * Computational Chemistry
          * Life Sciences and Medical Applications

                            KEY DATES:
