                             Parallel Computing

                    September 19-22, 1995  Gent-Belgium


ParCo95 is the continuation of a series of international conferences on
parallel  computing  started  more  than  a  decade  ago.   The  focus
is  on the application of all types of parallel computers.  The last
conference, ParCo93, was held in Grenoble, France.  Previous conferences
were held in Berlin, Leiden and London.  The aim of the conference is to
give an overview of the state-of-the-art of the development, applications,
and future trends in parallel computing.

Topic Areas

 Topic 1: Applications and Algorithms
   The application of parallel computers to solve all types of business,
   industrial,  scientific and engineering problems;  numerical and
   non-numerical algorithms.  The emphasis should be on the impact of the
   parallel processing paradigm.

 Topic 2: Systems Software
   Operating systems, languages and compilers; techniques such as
   threading; scheduling, load balancing;  message passing;
   automatic parallelisation, etc.

 Topic 3: Hardware
   Parallel computer hardware; architectural concepts; simulation;
   communication systems, protocols; enabling technologies, etc.

For each topic, aspects relating to
 - methodologies
 - software engineering and programming paradigms
 - development environments
 - performance and benchmarking
 - debugging
 - visualisation
 - etc.
may be discussed.  Preference will be given to papers discussing real
implementations and practical experiences.

Scientific Programme: The scientific programme will consist of invited
papers, contributed papers, and posters.  An industrial session and
an exhibition of equipment are also planned.

Proceedings:    The refereed proceedings of the conference will be
published after the conference.

Submission Guideline:     Contributions are solicited for presentation
as papers or posters in any of the topics listed above. Extended abstracts
(approx. 1000 words including the most important references) should outline
the problem discussed. The relevance and originality of the contribution
must be stated. Please indicate

  - whether the contribution is to be presented as a paper or a poster;
  - in which of the topics listed above it should preferably be included.

Four copies of the abstract must be submitted to the conference office
before the due dates. The conference language is English.
