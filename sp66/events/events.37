ANNOUNCEMENT:

		WORLD'S FIRST 3D SURGICAL VIDEOCONFERENCE
			NEW YORK CITY, SEPT. 8-11

  A special "VR in the OR" day is being planned for attendees to
the "Virtual Reality and Medicine - The Cutting Edge" conference
and exhibition, scheduled for Sept. 8 - 11 at the New York Hilton, N.Y.C.

  The site for "VR in the OR" is the Bronx VA Medical Center, where visitors
will participate in the following events:

	- Minimally Invasive Surgery
	- Anethesia Patient Simulator
	- Medical Videoconferencing

Minimally Invasive Surgery
--------------------------

  Participants will observe an MIS procedure, such as laparascopic
cholecystectomy, or herniorropathy conducted on a live animal, under
teh supervision of Robert J. Greenstein, M.D., surgeon and conference
co-chair.  Visualization will be by means of DeepVision (TM) (Automated
Medical Products Corp., N.Y.C.), as well as standard 2D video monitors.

Anesthesia Patient Simulator
----------------------------

  A full-featured anesthesiology patient simulator (Loral Corp.) will be
demonstrated, using a mannequin with computer-assisted intubation and
resuscitation, under the direction of Richard Payne, M.D., Sinai Dept. of
Anesthesiology.

Medical Videoconferencing - World's First 3D Surgical Videoconference
---------------------------------------------------------------------

  PictureTel Corp. (Maynard, Mass.), Automated Medical Products (N.Y.C.),
and Virtual Reality, Inc. (Pleasantville, N.Y.) have teamed up to provide
a demonstration of live surgical videoconferencing in 3D stereovision.
PictureTel codec units will transmit the surgical signal in compressed video
formatover ISDN link between the "VR in the OR" site at the Bronx VA Medical
Center and the main conference site at the New York Hilton in Manhattan.  The
decompressed video will be displayed on PictureTel display screens, as well as
on DeepVision 3D units and HMD's, allowing remote viewers the same "virtual
view" of the operative field seen by the presiding surgeons conducting the
live MIS procedure.
