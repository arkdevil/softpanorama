                     INVITATION

The East-West Conference on Computer Technologies in Education is the third
in the series of conferences designed to report the best research in the
field of Computer Technologies and Education and to provide opportunities
for the exchange of information and ideas between Eastern and Western
scientists.

                        VENUE

We want to introduce to you the Crimea where EW-ED'94 will be held.

The Crimea is a traditional holiday "favourite" for millions of Russian,
Ukrainian and all former Soviet people. This magic land is often called
"Russian Italy". There is a humorous idiom: Life is given to man but once
and it should be lived in the Crimea. The Crimea cannot be described in
words, it should be seen.

We wish you would have lucky chance to come to us.


                 CULTURAL ACTIVITIES

The Crimea has lots to offer!

Various excursions in the Crimea ranging from traditional visits to
Alupka, Livadia, Sevastopol, Ai-Petri... to unique trips such as a
helicopter excursion to the mediaevil cave town high in the Crimean
mountains. Sea pleasure trips. Sport. The Crimean wines and champagne
tasting. Other special interest activities. Your registration fees do not
include the cost of this programme. On your request we'll send you
additional information.

                      VISA

Ukrainian visa is not a problem now: you can get it on arrival.
Besides visa support is provided on request.

                  HOW TO GET IT
