European Symposium on
ADVANCED NETWORKS AND SERVICES
20-24 March 1995
RAI Congress and Exhibition Centre
Amsterdam, The Netherlands

Cosponsored by the European Optical Society and
SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering

This international symposium will explore the latest developments
in advanced networks and services. It is a forum for presenting
up-to-date research and development results, and for sharing
technical results of current laboratory studies, applications
research and field evaluations among the worldwide scientific and
technical communities involved in the discipline.

The primary emphasis will be on compression technologies and
standards for image and video communications, broadband services,
networks and advanced customer srevices, and passive fibre optic
systems and components. This symposium presents a unique
opportunity to survey state-of-the-art research and development
of novel techniques and new applications.

We invite you to join us in Amsterdam for this symposium. We
encourage you and your colleagues to submit papers on your recent
progress related to the conferences described in this Call for
Papers.

T. Russell Hsing, Bellcore, USA, Symposium Chair
A.C. van Bochove, PTT Research, NL, Symposium Chair.

Conferences planned for the symposium include:

1.  Passive Fibre Optic System Components
2.  Information Storage Technologies
3.  Broadband Strategies and Technologies for Local,
Metropolitan, and Optical Access Networks
4.  Receivers, Transmitters, and WDM's for Fibre Optic Networks
5.  Wireless Networks and Advanced Customer Services
6.  Broadband Medical Services
7.  Compression Technologies and Standards for Image and Video
       Communications
