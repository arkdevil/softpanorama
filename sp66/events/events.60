              PMI '94 - PROJECT EARTH PROGRAM - NEWS RELEASE

    Never before has there been such a large and impressive gathering
    for the purpose of identifying leadership roles and improved
    project management performance on local, regional, and
    international issues and projects related to environmental
    protection and restoration, and the development of sustainable
    growth projects.

    Join the LEADERS for this stretch to the future, where potential
    project team members take a hard look at the need for and the
    process of changing leadership roles in order to meet the
    requirements of environmental management and of social and
    economic sustainability.

    The Project Management Institute (PMI) will hold its 25th Annual
    Seminar/Symposium, "Leadership in a World of Change," October
    14-20, 1994 in Vancouver, BC, Canada, "one of the six most
    beautiful cities in the world."  PMI will host 1200 delegates from
    its 10,000+ world-wide membership.

    The Project Earth/Environmental Management track is a special
    feature of this year's seminar/symposium.  Environmental
    Restoration (ER) spotlights the US Department of Energy's $400+
    billion Thirty Year Plan and project management issues related to
    the program. Environmental Sustainability (ES) features the
    development of sustainable environmental ecosystems in the US and
    Canada.

    Bill McKnight, former Canadian Minister of Energy and Mining and
    member of the Canadian NAFTA Commission will kick off the shared
    "Leadership and Project Earth" stream with David Runnalls, Senior
    Advisor to the Canadian International Development Research Centre.
    US panelists will include Randal Scott, DOE Deputy Assistant
    Secretary of ER Compliance and Program Coordination, and Peter
    Devlin, Senior Engineer, DOE Office of Field Management.

    The Panel defines the challenges and opportunities related to the
    developing and achieving of sustainable international business
    growth and trade by the use of multi-national project teams.  The
    Panel discusses how the DOE provides improved project management
    involving 2,000 DOE personnel and 45,000 contractor personnel, how
    the DOE works with the EPA and the Corps of Engineers to expedite
    and improve cleanup processes, and how these processes and
    technologies will be shared with rest of the world.  These
    presentations and the discussions that follow will set the stage
    and challenge the remainder of the Leadership and Project Earth
    track.

    Dr. Frank King, Manager of the Calgary Winter Olympics, returns to
    the PMI Seminar/Symposium as the Keynote Speaker at the Tuesday
    Luncheon. Dr. King introduced "Project Earth: A Look Back from the
    Future" at PMI'90 where his address motivated the conference to
    initiate the Project Earth Specific Interest Group (SIG).

    Molly Harriss-Olson (the US President's National Council on
    Sustainable Development) and Ron Doering (the Canadian National
    Roundtable on Sustainability) join Dennis O'Gorman, Assistant
    Commissioner of the BC Resource and Environmental Council, Pat
    Scruggs, US Association of Environmental Protection and
    Sustainability Roundtables, Claude Lanthier, Chairman of the Great
    Lakes and St. Lawrence Waterways International Joint Commission
    and Dr. Alan Artibise, Executive Director of the International
    Centre for Sustainable Cities to feature trans-boundary
    perspectives related to prominent international and trans-boundary
    environmental projects.

    This program will challenge the delegates to develop significant
    improvements to the project management of environmental problems
    and establish what PMI and Project Earth SIG can do to start such
    improvements.

    The Workshops presented at PMI'94 will aid the delegates to answer
    these challenges -- select a workshop, or better yet, a series of
    workshops -- design your own course in continuing education!
    Environmental Restoration, PM for the Future presents proven,
    state-of-the-art tools and methods! Sponsored by the PMI Project
    Earth Specific Interest Group.

    Consider membership and corporate/agency sponsorship of PMI and
    Project Earth, attend or provide for attendance by associates.
