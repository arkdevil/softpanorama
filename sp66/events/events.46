IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT FROM INMOS

At WTC '94 INMOS will disclose its future plans for the T9000 transputer.

The 8" fabrication plant of SGS THOMSON in Crolles, France, is now
manufacturing substantial quantities of T9000 chips, which are being sold
as discrete components in development systems and as TRAMS. These together
with the C104 routing chips are being built into the multinode machines by
a number of companies.

All of these components and subsystem products are now being sold in volume.

Many of these products based on the latest T9000 chips can be seen in the
WTC '94 Exhibition. For more information, see below:
