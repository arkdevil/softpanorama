			   GRAPHICS INTERFACE'95
			     15 - 19 MAY 1995
			QUEBEC CITY, QUEBEC, CANADA

			      CALL FOR PAPERS


			   About the conference

Graphics Interface'95 is the twenty-first Canadian conference devoted to
computer graphics and interactive techniques, and is the oldest regularly
scheduled computer graphics conference in the world.  Now an annual
conference, a film festival, and workshops, Graphics Interface has
established a reputation for a high-quality technical program.  The 1995
conference will be held in Quebec City, Quebec, on 15-19 May, 1995.
Graphics Interface'95 is sponsored by the Canadian Human-Computer
Communications Society, and will be held in conjunction with Vision
Interface'95.  Each conference offers three concurrent days of invited and
submitted papers.  For a single registration fee, conference participants
can attend presentations in any of the two, promoting the exchange of
knowledge among both disciplines.  Two days (May 15 and 16) have been set
aside for workshops and other events.  A banquet and electronic theatre
provide additional opportunities to meet speakers and other attendees for
informal discussion in a social setting.

			   About Quebec City...

The conference will be held in Quebec City, Quebec.  This is the only
walled city in North America, the cradle of French civilization on our
continent, and one of the few cities in the world designated by UNESCO as a
World Heritage Site.  Inside the imposing fortifications of Old Quebec,
picture-book streets and ancient stone buildings, with dormer windows and
brightly painted shutters, take you back through the pages of history.
Charming shops and candle-lit restaurants are a delight to the eye and the
palate.  Many old buildings are now inns or bed-and-breakfast places.  Take
a stroll on the board walk and watch ships in the St. Lawrence far below.
Walk the ramparts of the Citadel, then the nearby Plains of Abraham where
British and French troops clashed in 1759.  Outside the old walls rises the
modern city where most residents live and work.  The clubs and restaurants
along Grande Allee provide a glittering night life.
