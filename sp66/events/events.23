                         Tutorial 1
       Data Parallel Programming using High Performance Fortran

                       Piyush Mehrotra
    Institute for Computer Applications in Science and Engineering


Description:
High Performance Fortran is a set of extensions to Fortran 90 designed
to facilitate data parallel programming on a wide variety of parallel
architectures. These extensions provide the user with high level
mechanisms to control the distribution of data and work across the
target architecture, while leaving the low level machine specific
details such as, data communication, to the underlying compiler/runtime
system.  This tutorial will use a sequence of examples drawn from
scientific applications to highlight important features of the language.

Lecturer:
Piyush Mehrotra received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the
University of Virginia. He was a staff scientist at ICASE for two years
before joining the faculty of the Department of Computer Science, Purdue
University.  He spent four and a half years at Purdue before returning
to ICASE as a Senior Staff Scientist where he is currently leading the
System Software Research effort.  His main research interests are
programming environments, compilers, and runtime systems for parallel
and distributed environments.  Among other activities, he has been a
member of the High Performance Fortran Forum since its inception and
has been intimately involved with the design of the language.


                      2:00 PM - 6:00 PM

                         Tutorial 2
    Introduction to Message Passing and Programming with PVM

                       D. N. Jayasimha
                 The Ohio State University


Description:
PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) is a portable message passing library
which runs on a variety of computing platforms from a cluster of
workstations to masssvely parallel processors.  The first part of the
tutorial will be a brief introduction to parallel architectures and
programming.  The main part will detail the use of PVM to write parallel
programs.  The last part will discuss guidelines for writing efficient
parallel programs and include a demonstration.  Knowledge of C or
FORTRAN and programming experience is assumed.  The intended audience
include scientists and engineers who wish to parallelize their
applications.

Lecturer:
D. N. Jayasimha received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  He is on the faculty in
Computer and Information Science at the Ohio State University.  He was a
Visiting Research Scientist at the NASA Lewis Research Center during
1993-94 where he worked on parallelizing applications using PVM and
other message passing libraries.  His research interests are in the
areas of communication and synchronization in parallel computation,
parallel architectures, and parallel applications.

                     Tutorial 3
         Parallel Programming in Fortran M

                     Ian Foster
           Argonne National Laboratories

Description:
Fortran M --- M for Modular --- is a small extension of Fortran 77 for
task-parallel programming.  Fortran M has object-oriented features and
provides compile-time guarantees of deterministic execution.
Compilers are available for many parallel and networked computers.
The tutorial will provide an introduction to programming in Fortran M,
focusing on the requirements of scientific and engineering
applications.

Lecturer:
Ian Foster received his Ph.D. from Imperial College in Computer Science
in 1988.  In 1989, the Strand programming system that he designed was
awarded the British Computer Society's award for technical innovation.
He is currently a Scientist in the Mathematics and Computer Science
Division of Argonne National Laboratory.  His latest book, "Designing
and Building Parallel Programs," is being published simultaneously by
Addison-Wesley and on the World Wide Web.

                     Tutorial 4
           Scalability of Parallel Systems

                  H. Venkateswaran
           Georgia Institute of Technology

Description:
A parallel system is an application-architecture combination.
Scalability is a term that is often used to signify the "goodness" of
parallel systems. A good understanding of this notion may be used to:
select the best architecture platform for an application domain,
predict the performance of an application on a larger configuration
of an existing architecture, and glean insight on the interaction between
an application and an architecture to understand the scalability of other
application-architecture pairs.  In this tutorial, we present a survey of
metrics used to capture this notion; the merits and demerits of these
metrics; the factors that lead to overheads in a parallel system; the
techniques such as experimentation, simulation, and analytical modeling
used in scalability studies; and recent advances in understanding the
scalability of parallel systems.

Lecturer:
H. Venkateswaran received his Ph.D. from the University of Washington,
Seattle in 1986.  He is currently an Associate Professor in the
College of Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta.
His primary research interests are in computational complexity theory
and parallel computation.  His research interests in parallel computation
concerns both theoretical and practical issues.  He is a co-principal
investigator in a project that studies the impact of architectural
features on the performance of parallel algorithms.
                       LOCATION



About Bangalore:
The venue for the First International Workshop on Parallel Processing
is the city of Bangalore.  Bangalore is the capital of the state of
Karnataka and is the fifth largest city in India.  It is about 250 Kms
from Madras and is about 800 Kms from Bombay.  Situated at an altitude
of approximately 1000 Meters above sea level, Bangalore has a population
of over three million people.  The city is the home to the Indian
Institute of Science, many aerospace and high technology industries
including the Center for Development of Advanced Computing and is
often called the Silicon valley of India.  The city's prominent
buildings include the Vidhana Soudha which is the Legislative building
and the palace of the maharaja of Mysore. From Bangalore many nearby
historic and archeological sites can be easily reached.


Visa and Passport:
All participants who are not citizens of India must obtain a valid
visa from Indian Consulates or High Commissions.  The procedure may
take some time, consult with your travel agent in advance.


Currency:
The currency is the Indian Rupee.  The conversion rate at the time of
this publication is 1 US $ to Rs. 31.50. Credit cards are accepted in
most luxury hotels but not in most commercial establishments. The
Reserve Bank of India may have certain restrictions on converting
Rupees to other currencies. For details, check with an Indian Consulate
or your travel consultant.


Time and Weather:
The Indian Standard Time(IST) is 5 1/2 hours ahead of the Greenwich
Mean Time(GMT) and is 13 1/2 hours ahead of the U. S. Pacific Standard
Time(PST).  In December/January the climate is mildly tropical with
temperatures averaging about 22 degrees Celsius (approx. 70 degrees
Fahrenheit) during the day and it is about 14 degrees Celsius (approx.
55 degrees Fahrenheit) during the night.


Travel:
Many international carriers fly to India.  Since Bangalore does not
have an international airport one has to fly into Bombay, New Delhi or
Madras and connect to Bangalore.  Indian Airlines and several private
private airlines connect Bangalore with major cities on a daily basis.
It is advisable to make reservations early as travel is heavy during
the months of December and January.  The workshop does not endorse any
travel agency, however, to assist international travellers with late
reservations a block of seats has been reserved.  You may contact
Globalink Travels in the Los Angeles area at 818-907-8302 (FAX) and
818-972-9525 (VOX) for details.


Accommodation:
The Oberoi is offering a special rate of US $ 129.50 (per night, single
or double) for workshop participants. The rate includes all taxes.  The
Oberoi is a deluxe hotel situated on Mahatma Gandhi road, which is the
city's most famous promenade. The hotel has a 24 hour business center
which has a comprehensive range of facilities, including offices for
private use and a board room for select meetings.  The airport is less
than 10Kms from the hotel.  The cost of the ride to or from the  airport
can vary, and a one-way taxi ride will cost around US $6 including tip.

in the state of Karnataka and in India) can be found on the
