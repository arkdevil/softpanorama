instantiated in a specific company to support the formulation of the
marketing strategy for a number of services and vertical markets.

The second demonstrator will show how practical elements of resource

schedule for allocation of resources (people and technologies) to support a
new marketing strategy within specific constraints is derived.

Demonstrations will also be available throughout the workshop.

The

INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON ENTERPRISE KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPMENT   -   EKD '94


is organised and sponsored by FEND.

FEND  -  the Federation for Enterprise kNowledge Development  -  is an
Association of European companies and research establishments. Its aim is
to

 "...increase  quality , innovation and responsiveness to change through
Enterprise Knowledge Development based on the use of business models."


FEND's Enterprise Knowledge Development approach is based on the use of
generic business models that can be customised by individual enterprises
into company models, to communicate knowledge for the purpose of:
*     improving organisational and business understanding;
*     developing business solutions in a coordinated manner;
*     supporting organisational learning.


Different types of models are needed to describe the enterprise as a
system:
* Strategic management - goals, strategies and plans derived from analysis
of market, competition, economic and socio-political factors.
*     Organisational design - organisational structures, roles,
responsibilities, communication networks;
*     Value Chain -  the business processes of the enterprise;
*     Resource Management - how people, technologies and information are
used to support the processes.


Business models assist in:
*     Enterprise Integration - company models are used to create a common
understanding of how the organisation operates and how it will develop in
the future. Distributed knowledge for enterprise-wide sharing in management
decisions, planning and business processes is established;
*     Coordinated Business Solution Formulation - the enterprise using its
own models together with the required information, develops solutions for
the company's management, planning and process improvement;
*     Organisational learning - experience feedback is captured and used to
enhance and improve company models, and the overall corporate knowledge
base.
