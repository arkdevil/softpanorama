Education and Visualization are often focused on a narrow
aspect, namely the use of visual techniques for education.
Within the education community, the interest in visual and
interactive techniques for teaching constantly increases.
The gain for the students is rooted in increased motivation,
improved intuition for complex problems, and better
communication and collaboration skills.  While the use of
visualization for teaching is important, visualization
utilizes new methods and tools that also need to be
taught in order to be used correctly.  The correct use of
visualization is not inherent in a person, but needs to be trained
similarly to the use of statistics or the design of user
interfaces.  This BoF will therefore focus on  teaching
visualization at the university level. Education in visualization
will benefit professionals in areas such as the sciences,
technology, business and education.


		TUESDAY EVENING SPECIAL SESSION
Tuesday 7:00pm
How to Lie and Confuse with Visualization (VizLies '94)

People have lied with statistics and maps for years.  Now it's
time to look again into lying and confusing in the field of
visualization. Your once-a-year big chance to do just that, in the
open, will be in this special session on Tuesday, October 18, 1994
at 7:00 pm.  You are invited to bring with you visualization lies
and confusing articles, yours or others, on 35 mm slides or video.
During this evening, it will be allowed to lie but not to borrow
credit, so please do not forget to mention the producers' names.
After the informal presentations and truthful debates, the
audience will choose the biggest (visualization) lie for 1994.
When the evening is over, lying will be outlawed again (for
another year).  Then, we will be all able to benefit from this
teaching of what it takes to produce realistic and faithful
visualizations.

	Reservations and advance submissions are now being accepted
(c/o Nahum Gershon, The MITRE Corporation, 7525 Colshire
Drive, McLean, VA 22102). Both are not required but are
strongly recommended.  For more information (genuine!), please

How to present color images to color deficient viewers? How to
deal with distributed environments where color resolutions,
capabilities, and specifications differ from one location to
another. The objective of this tutorial is to answer these
questions, but even more so, provide students with the tools to
answer these questions themselves. The tutorial will introduce
basic color theory and will continue to address the specific
needs of those who put images on computer screens.

TUTORIAL 6
Tuesday 8:30-5:30

provide the attendee a head start in fully utilizing Khoros 2.0.
The Khoros 2.0 application development environment redefines
the software engineering process to include all members of the
work group; the visualization end-user, the visual language
programmer, the toolbox programmer, and the infrastructure
programmer. The tutorial will concentrate more on issues
related to the productive creation of visualization software by
the visual language and toolbox programmer.

TUTORIAL 8
Monday 1:30-5:30
Visualizing Multi-Dimensional Geometry & Applications to
Multi-Variate Problems
Alfred Inselberg, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center
K. Esbensen, SINTEF
A. Chatterjee, University of Southern California
Level:       Beginning/Intermediate

The desire to augment our 3-dimensional perception and the
need to understand multi-variate problems has attracted
considerable attention and motivated several visualization
methodologies. Starting with a review of the field, the
connection between multi-variate problems and multi-
dimensional geometry will be established. Understanding the
underlying geometry of a multi-variate problem provides
important insights into what is possible and what is not.
With this motivation, the visualization of multi-dimensional
Geometry and multi-variate relations using Parallel
Coordinates will be rigorously developed. Relations among N
real variables are mapped uniquely into subsets of 2-space
having geometrical properties enabling the visualization of
the corresponding N-dimensional hypersurfaces. After the
basic representation results, associated algorithms for
constructions, intersections, transformations, containment
queries, proximity and others will be given. The theoretical
material will then be applied to a variety of application
areas.

events, concerts, opera, musicals and theater at Wolf Trap,

Washington, DC, attracts millions of visitors each year to its
monuments and museums.  The Smithsonian Institution alone
draws more visitors than any other tourist attraction in the
country, including Disneyland.  In this city of tree-lined
avenues laid out nearly 200 years ago by French surveyor
Pierre L'Enfant, there is much to see and do, from sightseeing,
to picknicking on the Mall, to attending cultural activities.
