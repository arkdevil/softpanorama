               Free Text Retrieval: The Magic Explained
             8 September 1994, University of Hertfordshire

Free text retrieval, or simply information retrieval, concerns
providing topic based searches of document collections. Typically such
systems operate with natural language documents and queries (typically
of the form 'find me documents about'). This meeting will provide
an explanation of the magic box which carries out the matching and
looks at some vogue areas such as multimedia and network based
retrieval.

The approximate agenda for the day is:
1400  Introduction
      The magic explained - Mark Dunlop, University of Paisley
        Overview of the process (index, match, display, feedback)
        Indexing (stemming, word frequency adjustment, thesauri)
        Matching (boolean, vector space, probability, inverted indexes)
        Relevance Feedback
        Testing systems

1510  Coffee & Tea

1540  Current Issues - Peter Robinson, University of Oxford
        Structured text (SGML, hypertext)
        Networked IR (World Wide Web etc.)
        Multimedia retrieval
        Copyright
        Electronic Journal Filtering

1650  Close

Attendance to the meeting is independent of other activities at Libtech
'94 and is charged at #30 per head - advance registration is recommended
