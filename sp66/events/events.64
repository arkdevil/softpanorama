Presentations - Wireless Data Communications

The National Wireless Communications Research Foundation
is hosting a conference on WDC, 26-27 January, 1995, in
Vancouver.

While the majority of persons presenting papers at this
conference have been specifically invited, we wish to extend
an invitation to those in industry, government or academia
who may have a significant contribution in the areas of
wireless data communications applications, interactions with
the "information highway", higher level protocols or
related areas.

The overview of this conference is described in a related
article appearing in the newsgroups news.conferences.announce
and comp.std.wireless.

It is expected that presentations will be of approximately
20 minutes in duration, structured for an audience con-
taining both technical and non-technical participants, and
primarily non-commercial in content.

Submissions will be accepted until 15 September, 1994, and
selections will be made arbitrarily by the conference
organizers and their program committee.  A preliminary
outline of the topic, and background of the applicant is
required by this data; complete manuscripts are required by
15 December, 1994.

Remuneration for travel, lodging or other expenses,
including consulting fees, is NOT normally provided.
Exceptions may be made on the basis of merit and circum-
stances.

Please address submissions or inquiries to:
