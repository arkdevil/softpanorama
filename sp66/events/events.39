Conference to present ways that patients can use computers to play an
expanded role in their own health care.The last few years have seen the
emergence of a new breed of medical computer programs and networks designed
to be used by health consumers.  These systems include:

        *               Home health workstations for chronic disease
        *               Patient input and access to computerized medical records
        *               Computer programs for short-term psychotherapy
        *               On-line, self-help support groups
        *               Fax, voicemail, and other phone-based systems
        *               Interactive systems which support patient
                        decision-making and provide medical information
                        and advice


Preliminary studies suggest that these new programs can help cut health
costs and extend services while improving the quality of care.  A wide
range of these new patient-centered computer programs will be showcased at
the upcoming conference, Consumer Health Informatics: Bringing the Patient
into the Loop.
