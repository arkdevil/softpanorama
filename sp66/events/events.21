Preliminary Program Announcement

NATIONAL SOFTWARE COUNCIL WORKSHOP

The National Security Industrial Association (NSIA) Software and Information
Systems Committee will host a workshop to plan and organize the National
Software Council.

NATIONAL SOFTWARE COUNCIL INITIATIVE

The National Software Council (NSC) is an initiative to organize and implement
a national advisory board reporting to the highest levels of government. The
Council will advise on major software issues, develop policy, and propose
national economic and technology initiatives.

WORKSHOP PROGRAM

What: The workshop will take place over a one and a half (1&1/2) day period.
It will revolve around panels that are organized based on the defined issues:
Legal, International, Societal, Economic, Education, and the NSC nominating
committee panel. This last panel will organize the NSC-Implementation
Committee (NSC-IC).

The NSC-IC will be responsible for carrying this task forward by finalizing
the charter for the NSC, organizing advocacy groups, and forming the NSC.
A Chair, Facilitator, and Speaker will be assigned to each panel. There will
be a plenary session that will include a welcome by Lloyd Mosemann, Deputy
Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Communications, Computers, and
Support Systems.

Where: The workshop will be held at the Center for Adult Education of the
University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland.

When: October 26 and 27, 1994.

A final program will be mailed in September 1994.

Participation in the workshop will include the following persons:

Lloyd Mosemann II, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for
                   Communications, Computers, and Support Systems
Robert Troy, President Director General, VERILOG
Giovanna Cinelli, Senior Partner, Gardner, Carton & Douglas
Dr. Edward Miller, President and Founder of Software Research, Inc.
Rick Linger, Member of the Senior Technical Staff, Loral
Sean Arthur; Professor, Virginia Polytechnic Institute
Walter Ellis, Consultant
Andrew Chruscicki, Member of the Technical Staff, Rome Laboratory, USAF
John Marciniak, Kaman Sciences Corporation, Workshop Chair

BACKGROUND

Software has become a powerful leveraging agent in the US economy. It is a
preeminent integrating element upon which many other critical technologies are
leveraged and depend. It is the ultimate green technology and agent of change.
It drives deep structural changes in the global economy through relentless
automation and augmentation of mental tasks, much as the industrial
revolution of the previous century transformed society through the
automation of physical tasks.

In short, software has become a crucial national resource, vital to the
well-being and competitiveness of the country.  In occupying this pivotal
role, the software sector faces important challenges:

     Achieving societal requirements for quality and reliability in
     critical software systems.

     Maintaining a strong defense largely dependent on complex,
     embedded software systems.

     Educating and training the current and future software
     workforce.

     Avoiding market and job losses from foreign competition.

     Establishing effective standards to guide development of ever-
     larger systems and networks.

     Protecting intellectual property and preventing software
     piracy.

     Promoting software research, investment, and trade.

     Ensuring competitiveness in the global marketplace.

     Developing a National Information Infrastructure and other
     21st century systems.


All of these challenges raise national issues that must be addressed in a
coherent and effective manner.

Origins of the National Software Council

The National Software Council was conceived as a response to the growing need
to address software issues of national importance. The NSC concept was
developed in 1993 at a USAF-sponsored workshop attended by software leaders
from academia, industry, and defense, under the guidance and vision of
Mr. Lloyd Mosemann.  A principal finding of the workshop was that software
had become a true national resource vital to the economy, and that a
national-level council was required to help shape public policy to ensure
its continued growth and vitality.

An NSC task force was organized to foster national advocacy and support for
the concept.  The final report of the task force recommended that the National
Security Industrial Association create an Implementation Committee composed
of members representative of the software community to proceed with
formation of the NSC.

In order to accomplish these tasks the Software and Information Systems
Committee (SISC) is organizing this Fall '94 workshop. The workshop will bring
interested parties together from a broad spectrum of society (industry,
government, and academia), present these persons with appropriate information
about the necessity for a NSC, explain the role of the NSC Implementation
Committee (NSC-IC), identify resource commitments that will be required,
and culminate in a nominating and/or voting process to organize the NSC
implementation committee.

The workshop has two objectives:

(1) Refine the key software issues that necessitate a NSC

(2) Organize the NSC Implementation Committee

The major issues will be addressed in the five parallel panels sessions listed
below. In each are identified the point of contact for the panel.

Panel A. Legal Issues - Jon Gross, SEI (703-908-8217; jgross@sei.cmu.edu)

Panel B. International Issues - Peter Corte (SAIC, 703-821-4488,
                                corte@,mclapo.saic.com)

Panel C. Societal Issues - Walter Ellis (202-362-7728; ellis@cse.ogi.edu)

Panel D. Economic Issues -  Gerry Barksdale, Hughes (714-732-0209,
                            gbark@sed.hac.com)

Panel E. Education - Paul Szulewski, Draper Laboratory (617-258-1832,
                     pas@draper.com)

The second purpose, organizing the NSC-IC, will be accomplished through
nominations received as a result of this flyer and future mailings.

The formation of a NSC Organizing Committee, the NSC-IC, is a step called out
in the Planning Task Force report. The purpose of this step is to create a
broadly based committee, more representative of society than the NSIA SISC.
The NSC-IC, once organized, would be charged with defining, advocating,
organizing and implementing the NSC. The NSC-IC will be organized through
Panel F, the NSC-IC Nominating Panel.

Panel F has a different purpose than the previous ones as it does not deal
with a specific issue, but rather with the composition of, and nominations
for, the NSC-IC. The objective is to organize the NSC-IC at the workshop
so that it can immediately pursue the organization of the NSC. Two SISC
points of contact are assigned to this panel: Diane Miller, BDM,
703-848-6720 and Robert Wint, EDS, 703-276-3841

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN ONE OF THE ISSUE
PANELS (A-E), please contact the panel point of contact directly, or drop a
mail note to NSIA c/o Joe Siler.

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN SERVING ON THE NOMINATING COMMITTEE
(PANEL F), please send a request to Diane Miller or Robert Wint. Include in
your request a one page bio-sheet and the reasons for your interest in
participating in the nominating committee.

IF YOU DESIRE TO NOMINATE SOMEONE FOR THE NSC-IC, send your
nomination to either Diane Miller or Robert Wint. The nomination should
include: a biography/resume; rationale for selection, full identification of
individual and current position, and whether the nomination is supported
by the nominee's organization. You will be contacted further with additional
instructions.
