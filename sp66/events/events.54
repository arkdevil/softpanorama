CFP: SYSTEMATIC METHODS OF SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY

AAAI 1995 Spring Symposium Series
March 27-29, 1995
Stanford University, California

Scientific discovery is surely among the most celebrated creative
processes.  Discovery receives scholarly attention from several
disciplines, not least of which is artificial intelligence.

AI has explored the view that much of scientific reasoning is problem
solving, and hence is akin to more ordinary types of reasoning.
Experience has shown that some scientific reasoning can be automated:
research on discovery has already yielded competent programs that,
e.g.,, plan organic syntheses, elucidate molecular structure,
determine reaction mechanisms, make interesting graph-theoretic
conjectures, and detect patterned behavior. Where all this may lead
was foreseen by Allen Newell [Artif.Intell.; 25(3) 1985]:

 [The field] should, by the way, be prepared for some radical, and
 perhaps surprising, transformations of the disciplinary structure of
 science (technology included) as information processing pervades it.
 In particular, as we become more aware of the detailed information
 processes that go on in doing science, the sciences will find
 themselves increasingly taking a metaposition, in which doing
 science (observing, experimenting, theorizing, testing, archiving, ...)
 will involve understanding these information processes, and
 building systems that do the object-level science.  Then the
 boundaries between the enterprise of science as a whole (the
 acquisition and organization of the knowledge of the world) and AI
 (the understanding of how knowledge is acquired and organized)
 will become increasingly fuzzy.

The goals of this symposium are to examine how far we have come to
realizing Newell's vision, to identify fruitful current opportunities,
and to discuss the obstacles to progress in further understanding of
systematic methods for scientific inference.  We solicit contributions
that advance these goals.  Some examples of appropriate contributions
include:

o A program that automates a complex and creative scientific task.
o A new systematic method of scientific inference, even if its
  automation is not yet feasible.
o A new representation or classification of science that enhances
  efforts to systematize it.
o New opportunities for known systematic methods.
o A recent scientific achievement where the computer played an
  essential creative role.
o New heuristics for scientific research, e.g., that promise to
  make practicable some aspect of automated scientific reasoning.
o Computational models of historical discoveries in science.
o Cognitive studies of the scientific process that promise to
  contribute to computational approaches

Contributions that potentially bear on more than one scientific area
and that are demonstrably effective are of special interest.

Working notes will be prepared and distributed to participants.

A general plenary session, in which the highlights of each concurrent
symposium will be presented, will be held on Tuesday, March 28, and an
informal reception will be held on Monday, March 27.

In addition to invited participants, a limited number of other
interested parties will be able to register on a first-come,
first-served basis.  Registration will be available by January 1,
1995.  To obtain registration information write to the AAAI at 445
Burgess Drive, Menlo Park, CA 94025 (sss@aaai.org).

DATES - Submissions are due on October 28, 1994.  Notification of
acceptance will be given by November 30, 1994.  Material to be
included in the working notes of the symposium must be received by
January 20, 1995.
