Call For Papers, Portable By Design Conference

The conference is for designers of portable equipment and is sponsored by
Electronic Design Magazine. It is not an end-user conference or a
marketing conference. It is for engineers and engineering managers. It
will be held at the Santa Clara Convention Center in Calif. on Feb.
13-17, 1995.

Although we are looking for papers authored by engineers who are
designing portable systems, we will entertain papers that are co-authored
by an applications engineer and the systems engineer that used the
product as part of his or her portable design.

To begin, we would like to see an abstract of the paper. along with the
names of the co-authors. The abstract need not be long, but it should
give a good indication of the topic and the paper's theme. Abstracts are
reviewed by the chairperson of the appropriate session, and perhaps by
the Technical Advisory Committee.

Full papers are due December 1.

The topics to be covered include:

Low-Power Microcontrollers; High-End Microprocessors; Software:
Application Development, OSs, BIOS Requirements, and Networking Software
From a Hardware Developer's Perspective; Low-Power Analog Circuits;
Power-Control Circuits For Portable Designs; Power Management: Chip Sets
and Software and Firmware Techniques for Low Power; Batteries: Coming
Technologies and Round-Table Discussion; Expandability: PCMCIA, Mass
Storage, and I/O; Input Devices and Displays: The Human Interface;
Connectivity and Communications From the System Designer's Perspective;
Packaging and Assembly; Managing the Mechanical/Electrical Design Team;
and Engineering the Whole System.

Send abstracts to Rich Nass, Technical Conference Chairman at
Internet:richnass@class.org or Compuserve: 73602,3653 or Fax: (201)
393-0204. For more information, call (201) 393-6090.
