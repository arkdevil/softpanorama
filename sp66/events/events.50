You and members of your organization are invited to participate in a
special seminar titled:

User Interface Strategies '95:  The Information Superhighway

Tuesday, December 13, 1994
11 AM - 5 PM Eastern

Presented by
Ben Shneiderman, University of Maryland
Frank Stein, IBM
H. Rex Hartson & Deborah Hix, Virginia Tech
Kent Norman, University of Maryland

	Five leaders in the field of human-computer interaction
present their views on the emerging information superhighway.  The
topics the presenters will discuss include new and improved user
interface strategies, the reality behind the hype of interactive
television, the implications in reshaping training and education, and
the development of usable interfaces.  They emphasize the information
superhighway as a central focus for expanding applications of
computers in business, education, and the home.  They offer their
vision and suggest exciting technological developments for the new
decade.

Benefits
You will:
% Learn and understand the Visual Information Seeking principles (VIS)
% Receive insights on the current status of interactive television and
the future technology that will lead to the envisioned Information
Superhighway
% Perceive education and training as a key component of the
Information Superhighway to achieve both professional and personal
goals
% Feel assured about the ease and efficiency of the Information Superhighway

Intended Audience
User interface designers, programmer, software engineers, interface
evaluators, managers in the computing and communications fields,
technical writers, human factors specialists, trainers, and marketing
personnel.  The seminar will benefit all those who need to understand
the Information Superhighway and its implications for the future.
