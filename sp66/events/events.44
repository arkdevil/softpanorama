	 WORKING GROUP 8.1 CONFERENCE IN THE CRIS SERIES - "CRIS'94"

		SECOND CALL FOR PARTICIPATION AND POSTERS

    "METHODS AND ASSOCIATED TOOLS FOR THE INFORMATION SYSTEMS LIFE CYCLE"

			  26-28 September 1994

			 Maastricht, Netherlands

			 ***********************
Location
--------
The conference will be held at the University of Limburg in the famous and
historic town of Maastricht which is in the south east corner of the
Netherlands near the border with Belgium and Germany.  Maastricht has its
own airport.  Its unque location and, of course, the signing of the `Treaty
of Maastricht' in 1991 give the city a distinctive European character.

Themes
------
Following on the three successful conferences held in 1982, 1983, 1986 and
1988, CRIS 94 will also concentrate on the features and applications of
methods (now regarded as a more correct term than methodologies).  Methods
have grown in acceptance since the earlier CRIS conferences and there has
been considerable convergence in the basic techniques used by practitioners.

CASE tools have continued to proliferate and there has been an emergence of
tools which generate an operational system.

There are two important areas in which both methods and CASE tools are lacking,
namely the area of distributed systems and the area of access control.

It is the aim of CRIS 94 to provide a platform for exploring the state of the
art, the state of practice, the state of research and the state of harmoniz-
ation work.

With this in mind, three themes are identified within the overall area of
methods and tools and each paper to be presented at the conference is related
to one of the three themes.  Ample time will be available for discussion of
each paper and the discussion of each submitted paper will start with a short
review by a member of the Programme Committee.
