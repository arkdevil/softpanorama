If your work involves wireless technology, perhaps the best forum to
compare notes and share ideas with your peers is the Third Annual Wireless
Symposium and Exhibition.  Covering everything from automotive electronics
to wireless local-area networks (WLANs), the Wireless Symposium and
Exhibition is looking for technical presenters willing to discuss wireless
topics.  Technical sessions feature papers with practical design ideas,
test techniques, and solutions for advanced system architectures.

This conference has turned out to be a leading forum for Wireless
Communications.  The interest level and attendence are very high.  The
conference has a global view.  The presenters are from many countries.
I am a chairperson for a session on active electronic circuits.
If you have a paper that is electronic-circuits related, please
send an abstract as soon as possible to my email address below.
If your abstract is non-circuits related, you can either send
it to me and I will forward it, or you can communicate directly
to the organizers.
