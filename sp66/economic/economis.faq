  0. NOTES

     If you would like to learn more about the Internet and its use in
     economics and finance, there will be sessions at the following 
     meetings in the fall and winter: FMA (one session), AFA (one session), 
     SEA (one session) and AEA (three sessions). If you have any questions or 
     topics you would like to see covered, please feel free to contact me, Bob 
     Parks <bparks@wuecona.wustl.edu>, or George Greenwade <bed_gdg@shsu.edu>,
     or Jim Garven <jgarven@mail.utexas.edu>.

* 1. INTRODUCTION

     This document, which is updated every two months or so, and its
     successors, can be found in several places. They include, via ftp, at
     ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/sci.econ.research/econ-resources-faq.
     Via gopher, it can be found at the Economics Gopher at Sam Houston
     State University and at the Economics Working Paper Archive at
     Washington University at St. Louis (at this site, one can also read 
     the document by sections and it can be searched). Both these gophers 
*    are described below. Via email, it can be obtained by writing SENDME
*    ECONOMICS.INTERNET-RESOURCES in the body of a mail message sent to
*    FILESERV@SHSU.edu or by writing to econ-wp@econwpa.wustl.edu with GET
*    ECON.FAQ in the subject line. Finally, I'd be happy to send it out via
     email to all who request it. However, I don't maintain a mailing list
     for its distribution; rather, I encourage folks to get a copy from one
     of the economics sites mentioned above. You'll find a huge variety of
     other material of interest there.

     This is my seventh stab at this document. I am very interested 
     in any corrections, suggestions, omissions, and hints anyone 
     might have. 

     While relatively few economists use the Internet, there is a
     surprising amount of very useful information on it. For instance,
     there are two very extensive sets of U.S. macro data, detailed
     data from the Fed and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, a 
     bibliography of some 35,000 working papers in economics, household 
     surveys from 21 countries, numerous interactive electronic markets, 
     the AEA directory, extensive financial data, 70 mailing lists, and 
     two Usenet newsgroups. 

     I apologize for any crosspostings to different mailing lists. However, 
     it appears that economists use many different lists, so to reach the 
     broadest audience, crosspostings are unavoidable.

     Some of the information is not as complete as I would wish. Further,
     some of the resources I have not investigated thoroughly and I cannot
     vouch for them. While I catalog many mailing lists, I have little
     information about the volume and types of discussions.

     Most of the resources I was able to find deal with the United States.
     Leads on information on other countries would be appreciated.

     I would like to acknowledge many who have commented and made
     suggestions on previous versions of this document. Without their help,
     there would be fewer resources listed and the existing descriptions
     would be more difficult to read. In particular, I would like to thank
     Forrest Smith for suggesting I undertake this project, and Thomas
     Krichel, George D. Greenwade and Bob Parks for constant suggestions.
     More generally, I have received help from Mona Andersen, Dave Barrett,

   Notes:

    - If you are new to the Internet, see the section titled "USEFUL
      BOOKS, PROGRAMS, AND RESOURCES ABOUT THE INTERNET."

*   - I give the location of all items as URLs (Uniform Resource Locators).
*     In general, they are of the form method://host/location, where method
*     is telnet, gopher, ftp (anonymous unless otherwise stated), and http
*     (for World Wide Web resources). Host refers to the computer that is
*     the server for the data; for instance, I currently use whale.st.usm.edu.
*     Finally, the location denotes the directory or directories and the file
*     name. For telnet, there may be additional material for a password and
*     userid. In that case, the URL is telnet://userid:password@host/location.
*     Finally, some URLs require the "port" number on the server. This will
*     follow the host with a colon preceding it. 

*     Note that many resources can be accessed in a variety of way. Generally,
*     World Wide Web (often called "www" or the "web") and gopher are the 
*     easiest to use. In fact, web clients, such as Mosaic, Cello, and Lynx, 
*     can access any resource denoted by a URL (i.e. telnet, gopher, ftp and
*     the web). Thus, if you're new to the Internet, you should seriously
*     consider such client software as your primary tool. 

*     Some client software can use URLs directly; in fact, URLs basically
*     came from work on the web. However, many gopher clients cannot use
*     URLs, so I have given gopher directions in a variety of ways to suit
*     different levels of expertise and clients. The first I call direct,
*     where I give the gopher server and any directories you might need to
*     move to the desired area. For many users, this might be the easiest
*     method. The second is indirect; on most gopher menus, there is an entry
*     for something like "Other Gophers" from which one can navigate
*     gopherspace by geographical regions. The indirect method shows how to
*     move through these regions. Finally, I list bookmark information, which
*     many gopher clients can use (if the path is not given, then the desired
*     material is in the root directory). Since material on gophers and web 
*     servers often moves, if you can't find it, try starting from the top.

    - Items in " " are typed directly as commands, or denote directories
      and files. The context should make this clear.

    - Most of the gopher and web sites devoted to economics are
      interconnected; no mention is made of this below since it would take
      a lot of space to say who is connected to whom. The gophers at Sam
      Houston State University, the Economics Department at Washington
      University in St. Louis and RiceInfo seem to have the greatest number
      of interconnections.

    - Information about compressed files, converting binary files
      to text so they can be emailed and converted back to binary,
      and locations of gopher and web software can be found in the section
      titled "USEFUL BOOKS, PROGRAMS, AND RESOURCES ABOUT THE INTERNET."


*  2. NEW IN THIS VERSION 

*     This version, 7.11, is a minor "bug fix" from 7.1 and 7.0. Basically,
*     the fixes involved correcting some URLs, with a very small number of 
*     miscellaneous corrections. The correction and modification notation 
*     described in the next paragraph are relative to version 6.

      New resources in this draft are denoted with a + in the first column
      of the title, while changes to resources mentioned previously are
      denoted with a * in the first column where appropriate.

*     Major new resources in this edition include a searchable version of
*     the AEA directory, offerings by North-Holland; QuoteCom, which offers
*     very extensive financial market data; CARL's UnCover, which has an
*     extensive database of bibliographical data on economics journals
*     (articles can even be ordered for delivery via fax); job listings for
*     European economists (at the Technical University Berlin Economics 
*     Department), an extended section on connecting to other sorts of 
*     resources on the Internet; and a new section on economic organizations
*     on the Internet. In addition I've converted all references to URLs and
*     the methods for connecting to gophers has been expanded.

*     Finally, parts of this document have been reorganized to better
*     reflect the contents of the resources.


  3. U.S. MACRO AND REGIONAL DATA    
     
*  A. Economic Bulletin Board (EBB)

      This service is an outgrowth of a dial-up bulletin board offered by 
      the U.S. Department of Commerce. It contains more than 3,000 files 
      from the Departments of Commerce, Labor, Energy, and Treasury, the 
      White House, the Federal Reserve, and other agencies.

      The EBB is currently offered on the Internet in two places. The first 
      is a telnet interface to the EBB at the Department of Commerce, and 
      the second is at a library gopher at the University of Michigan. It 
      _appears_ that there is more data at the EBB at the Commerce 
      Department.


      EBB at the Commerce Department 

      Charges for Internet telnet access are as follows.
        Timed Charges:
          Annual subscription fee     $45
          Credit for connect charges  $20
          8AM - noon (Eastern)        $24/hour
          noon - 6PM                  $18/hour
          6PM - 8AM (& holidays,       $6/hour
                     weekends)     

      The current telent interface is basically that used for the dial-up 
      bulletin board. Thus, one must capture the information from the screen 
      or use a bulletin board type download (such as Kermit). I have not 
      tried the latter and can offer no advice. To capture all screen data 
      on a Unix system, one can do "telnet ebb.stat-usa.gov | tee ebb.data"
      where tee takes the screen data and places it in the file "ebb.data" 
      as well as on the screen with a plain ASCII download.

*     Interfaces other than telnet are currently under investigation.

      Limited guest accounts are available; use "guest" as the password. 
      You are limited to 20 minutes of connection time (but you can connect 
      back immediately), and not all files are available.

      Most information is in six areas: the bulletin system (which describes
      how to use the system), the file system (which contains files), the
      trade promotion system, the presidential system, the news system (on
      files and news flashes), and the utilities system (which sets
      passwords, terminal types, etc.). Basic information on the system can
*     be found in the bulletin system (entered by typing "B") by typing "I",
*     while a listing of files can  be found in the file listing system
*     (entered by typing "F").

      Data comes in several formats. Some comes in DOS self extracting
      files, some in .PRN (so it can be used in spreadsheets or software
      that can import spreadsheet data), and some in a specialized format.

      Gary Langer's BCI Data Manager, described below, is a Windows 3.1
      program that lets you manage this database.

      telnet://ebb.stat-usa.gov


      EBB at the University of Michigan Library Gopher

      The University manually downloads files daily from the EBB. It is said
      to contain 700 files; it _appears_ that the data covered is a subset
      of the data at the Commerce Department's EBB. General information
*     about the system can be found in the directory "IMPORTANT!!
*     README!!". Information on file formats and the system in general can
      be found under in the directories "Current Business Statistics" and
      "EBB and Agency Information and misc. files." As with the Commerce
      Department location, data comes in several different forms. A
      convenient listing of all directories for the EBB can be found in a
      file called "contents" "University of Michigan Libraries" (described
      below).

      One good educational use of this gopher is recent press releases
      concerning economic statistics. I frequently use it just before my
      macro class to check the most recent numbers.

      The directory directly above EBB at the University of Michigan contains 
      a variety of useful information.

      Again, Gary Langer's BCI Data Manager, described below, is a Windows 
      3.1 program that lets you manage data from this database.

      telnet://gopher@una.hh.lib.umich.edu/Social Science Resources/Economics
      gopher://una.hh.lib.umich.edu:70/11/socsci/econ
      Gopher
        direct: una.hh.lib.umich.edu /socsci/Economics
        indirect: USA/Michigan/University of Michigan 
                  Libraries/Social Science Resources/Economics
        bookmark: Type=1+ Name=Economics Path=1/socsci/econ
                  Host=una.hh.lib.umich.edu Port=70
      

*  B. EconData
      
      This database, collected by INFORUM, a project building an
      inter-industry model of the U.S. economy, processes a wide variety of
      macro data and places it in a common format. Data includes the
      National Income and Product Accounts, balance of payments, flow of
      funds, monthly employment surveys, CPI, PPI, Business Conditions
      Indicators, blue pages from the Survey of Current Business, industrial
      production, the Penn World Tables, and state and local data including
      employment, earnings, GSP and state personal income. International
      data from the IMF and World Bank is available, but permission must be
      obtained from them. One hopes, that with time, this will change.

      The data is accessed by programs (only for PCs) provided by this
      project and it can easily be output to ASCII or into a spreadsheet
      format. The data is also compressed with pkzip, and they provide this
      and similar programs as well.

      For introductory information, a brief overview is in "readme.doc",
      while more detailed information is in "Instruction/contents.doc" and
      "Instructions/guide.doc".

      The program that retrieves data (PDG) is relatively straightforward,
      but let me add my own experiences. First, you may need to change the
      path to the help files in the "g.cfg" file. Assuming that you're in a
      directory with one of the unzipped data files, start the program by
      typing "pdg". Then, a return will allow you to start normally. The
      command "look" allows one to survey the data in that file (additional
      commands are found on the bottom of the screen that allow you to print
      the data to the screen or graph it). One leaves the look command with
      an escape. To print the data to an external file in columns, use the
      "matty" command. After typing "matty" and the full file name you
      choose, you'll be prompted for the series names that can be obtained
      with "look". Don't separate series names with commas and be sure to
      end the command with a semicolon. The output of matty lists dates in
      the first column, but you'll need to modify the fractions used to
      denote months and quarters. Finally, you can easily plot data to the
      screen to get an approximate idea of what it looks like.

      This site offers very detailed data in a number of areas. Quoting from 
      their documentation, they include:
         Average Price Data
         Collective Bargaining-State & Local Gov't
         Collective Bargaining-Private Sector

         Work Stoppage Data

      Data is generally quite disaggregated; overall, there are many 
      megabytes of files. Besides historical data, recent press releases 
      are available.

      All data is in the "pub" directory, which contains a further three
      directories: "doc", "news.release", and "time.series". For a short
      introduction, read the "README" file in the "pub" directory, while
      information on how the files are stored is located in the
      "overview.doc" file in the "doc" directory.

      In general, the news releases in the "news.releases" directory are
      quite useful for tracking current events, while the great amount of
      detail in the actual time series will be quite useful for many
      researchers.

   D. Federal Reserve
 
      To paraphrase from the "README" file for this information, this data
      is from PC disks made available by the Board of Governors and placed
      on the Internet by the Internet Multicasting Service (which, among
      other things, helps run EDGAR and the Internet's own "radio" show,
      "Geek of the Week.").

      In general, the data is quite extensive and detailed. Most dates back
      a number of years. All is in ASCII form, but some of the columns
      widths are more than 80 characters and some of the names are less than
      intuitive. As always, be sure to read all the information provided in
      the various help files.

      All data is in the "fed" directory. Quoting from the "README" file in
      that directory, the data is in the following directories:

         flow         Flow of funds tables.
         g_17         Industrial production and capacity utilization.
         g_17_his     Industrial production and capacity utilization.
         h_3          Reserves of depository institutions.
         h_4_2        Weekly series on assets and liabilities of 
                      large commercial banks.
         h_15         Selected interest rates.
         money        Money stock measures and components.
         others       Other Federal Reserve data tables.

      Each directory contains many files and some even contain other
      directories of data. In each, there are several compressed files in
      different formats (denoted with different filename suffixes) with that
      directory's files. Each directory also contains a file with
      information on the data in that directory (the names of these files
      vary).

*  E. New England Electronic Economic Data Center (NEEEDc)

      This database, the bulletin board of the Federal Reserve Bank of
      Boston, specializes in data on the New England economy. It carries all
      historical data published in the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's New
      England Economic Indicators (some 90 variables from 1969 for all
      states and some metropolitan areas) and GSP data for the New England
      area from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The data is in .PRN format, 
      so it can be read directly by Lotus or Quatro.

   F. Economic Report of the President
 
      This electronic version of the Economic Report of the President is
      from the U.S Department of Commerce's quarterly CD-ROM product, the
      National, Economic, Social, & Environmental Data Bank (NESE DB), which
      is distributed to all Government Depository Libraries. Since,
      apparently like all U.S. government information, it is not
      copyrighted, it may be copied for further distribution. In this case,
      the Univ. of Missouri at St. Louis has placed this information on
      their gopher.

      Besides the text of the document, it also contains graphics files of
      the graphs and Lotus spreadsheet files of the very useful data in this
      document. Apparently, a few of the spreadsheet files are corrupted,
      but this appears to stem from problems with the original CD, not
      problems with transferring the data from the CD to this gopher site.

      Currently, this site contains the reports from 1992 and 1993, and the
      report for 1994 is expected soon.

  4. OTHER U.S. DATA 

   A. National Archives Center for Electronic Records

      The National Archives has a branch devoted to the storage of
      electronic records from many federal entities. Of interest to
      economists are records from the Bureaus of the Census, Economic
      Analysis, and Labor Statistics, the Civil Aeronautics Board,
      Department of Transportation, IRS, SEC, and Social Security
      Administration. While the records are not available over the Internet
      (at least not yet), detailed information about them, including a
      listing of "data files" and ordering information for the data files
      (generally available only on 9-track tape reels or 3480 tape
      cartridges) are available. Currently, some 6,200 data files out of
      more than 14,000 available are listed in a rapidly growing list. Some
      of the data files are old, while some are relatively recent. Some
      entities have only a small selection of data, while for others, the
      listings are more complete. Unfortunately, the tapes are relatively
      expensive at either $80.75 or $90.00 (depending upon the medium), with
      additional tapes at $24.50. One can hope that a less expensive on-line
      database is not too far in the future. Since a comprehensive list of
      files here is impossible, the interested researcher should examine
      them. Much more information about this service can be found in the
      directory listed below.

*  B. Social Security Administration (OSS-IS)

      This site offers a variety of material. Besides extensive information 
      for beneficiaries, there is substantial statistical material, basically
*     annual and current operating tables. Since these tables are in
*     different formats, be sure to read the appropriate descriptions of
*     them. For ftp access, see the file "pub/statistics/README.FIRST". For

   C. FedWorld

      This site provides an entry-way from the Internet to many
      U.S. Government Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) that one
      usually contacts via a phone and modem at (703) 321-8020. 
      While there is relatively little material directly related to 
      economics that cannot be obtained more directly, it is still useful.

   D. Census Data
       
      A common site for U.S. and some Canadian Census information is located
      at this gopher. This gopher provides links to other gophers that
      actually contain the data. The material is not coordinated, so some
      searching may be in order. I was particularly impressed with the
      collection at the University of Missouri -- they have data for all U.S.
      counties and cities.

   E. U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service
 
      This project is jointly sponsored by the Mann Library at
      Cornell University and the Economic Research Service of the
      U.S. Department of Agriculture. It contains more than 140 data
      sets, and more are due to be added. These data sets cover a 
      very wide range of agricultural topics, and even include 
      international and climate data. They are frequently quite detailed, 
      and are mostly in Lotus 1-2-3 .WK1 format (thus, if you transfer 
      them with ftp, be sure to use the binary mode). Gopher is the 
      preferred connection method (files cannot be transferred with 
      telnet unless your telnet client can call ftp).

      This site contains extensive statistical information on the
      banking system in the U.S., as well as some information for
      consumers on deposit insurance and dealing with bank failures.
      In addition, there is information for librarians and researchers
      on all statistical publications by the FDIC.

      Statistical information is from "The Statistics on Banking." There 
      are issues for 1934-1992, for 1991, and 1992. Most data is in Lotus 
      123 .WK1 format. There are numerous help files that explain the 
      holdings.

*  G. U.S. Census Bureau

      This official site of the Census Bureau currently offers
      considerable information about the Census Bureau, press releases,
      and links to other Census sites on the Internet through its
      Gopher. For the moment, perhaps the most useful information from
      this site can be obtained from the Data Extraction System, DES
      (formerly known as SIPP -- Survey of Income and Program
      Participation). DES allows one to make extractions from large
      surveys. For economists, the most useful survey one can make
      extractions from is the Current Population Survey. Output from the
      extractions can come in several different formats (ASCII, Ingress,
      and several SAS formats) in several different methods, including
      email and ftp.

      To access the DES system, one telnets to gateway.census.gov,
      logs on with the username of "desuser", and simply presses the
      return key when prompted for the password. The DES system is
      fairly easy to navigate, with the possible exception that one
      moves back up a menu by pressing the Q key (for quit).

      Plans are plans to put additional surveys in the DES system.

+  H. National Trade Data Bank

      While probably not of much interest to academic economists, this site
      pulls together a very wide range of information (more than a gigabyte)
      from more than 25 U.S. government agencies that will be of interest to
      firms wishing to export from the U.S. Obviously, it contains a
      substantial amount of material that may be of interest to those
      interested in non-U.S. countries. One can even search the entire
      database with natural language requests.

  5. WORLD AND NON-U.S. DATA

   A. Luxembourg Income Study (LIS)

      This project brings together 66 household surveys from 21 countries
      into a common database to make studies of international economic
      comparisons easier. For instance, it includes Current Population
      Surveys from the U.S., French Surveys of Income, and a Hungarian
      Income Study. The average survey has approximately 9,000 households
      with more than 20,000 members. To maintain confidentiality and
      restrictions on use, the data remains on the host computer in
      Luxembourg and researchers run jobs remotely on that system through
      electronic mail. Users must first register to use the database.

      They also have an annual database of 100 macro indicators available on
      floppy disks to put the household surveys in context. This database
      also contains rules on taxes and transfers in each country to make
      international comparison meaningful.

      The datasets are well documented, and workshops and newsletters help
      the researcher to use this complex database.

   B. Productivity Analysis Research Network (PARN)

      This organization is composed of researchers doing work in the area of
      productivity analysis. Data is maintained at two sites: BYU
      University, and European Concise site in the U.K. The former offers a
      standard ftp site, and the latter uses a nonstandard interface
      accessed through telnet or through email. Both sites contain
      information on the organization, a membership list, guides, and a
      newsletter.

   C. World Bank Public Information Center (PIC)

      In a recent policy change, the World Bank is making more operational
      information publicly available, and the Public Information Center
      (PIC) is part of this process. While past data is not being released,
      as time marches on, more and more information will be available
      through the PIC. Such data covers a number of areas, including
      projects under development, Staff Appraisal Reports (SARs), some
      Country Economic and Sector Work (CESW) reports, Sectoral Policy
      Papers, Environmental Data Sheets, some environmental assessments,
      National Environmental Action Plans (EAPs), and evaluation reports
      from the Operations Evaluation Department. This gopher also has
      information on World Bank Publications (including ordering
      information).

   D. Country Reports on Economic Policy and Trade Practices for 1992 
 
      This report, from the U.S. Department of State, gives a fairly
      brief synopsis of economic information on a number of countries.
      Besides recent aggregate data, it also contains textual information
      on that country's economic policies and structure. Special emphasis
      is made on issues that influence trade with the U.S.

      This information is placed on the Internet by the Univ. of Missouri
      at St. Louis by the same mechanism used for the Economic Report of 
      the President.

      publications, lists of offices, their classification systems,
      subscription information on their listserv, and ordering information
      on their CD-ROM database, E-STAT (which has some 300,000 time series
      on Canada).

      In the future, Statcan Online, with more extensive data, will connect
      to the Internet. It will be a fee-based service.

      The last two weeks of material from the Daily is on this gopher (the
      primary interface for Statistics Canada), while the last six months is
      kept on the ftp site.

      Statistical Office (CSO) Macro-Economic Time Series Data Bank (with
      12,000 time series); the OECD's Main Economic Indicators (with more
      than 2500 time series).

      Some of this data is from the ESRC Data Archive at the University of
      Essex.

+  G. Israel Information Service Gopher

      This gopher provides a variety of information on the state of Israel. 
      Of likely interest to economists are the sections titled Basic 
      Statistics on Israel and The Economy in Israel. Both contain various 
      sorts of summary material on Israel's economy.

+ 6. FINANCIAL MARKET DATA

+  A. Other Sources 

      The best sources for data of this type is to turn to the Internet
      document that specializes in it (I have only placed some of the many
      resources I've come across here). That source is the general 
      misc.invest FAQ (i.e. the Frequently Asked Questions (and answers) of 
      the Usenet newsgroup misc.invest). Besides detailing the many ways you 
      can obtain financial data on the Internet (the summer of 1994 has seen 
      a number of announcements), it also covers many topics of interest to
      investors.
      
      ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/investment-faq/general


   B. EDGAR (SEC)
 
      This database opened in January of 1994. It covers fillings by U.S.
      public companies made to the SEC. It covers such things as 10K, 10Q,
      annual, quarterly reports, and many other items. In all, the SEC
      receives 10 million pages a year of such data. Plans were for 3,000
      companies to file electronically into EDGAR by the end of 1993, with
      all 15,000 companies required to file with the SEC eventually required
      to file into EDGAR.

      Previously, this database was available only through Mead Data in
      either inconvenient locations or at very considerable expense. In an
      experiment, it is now be available at no cost over the Internet. This
      service is provided and funded by the NSF, the NYU Stern School of
      Business, and the Internet Multicasting Service, run by Carl Malamud,
      who I understand is (was?) an economist at the Board of Governors.

      This database only covers fillings made in 1994 for public consumption, 
      when made electronically by the filling company. Thus, it does not 
      cover earlier years, current paper fillings, or non-public ones. Even 
      so, the data is extensive; there appear to be more than 6,000 fillings 
      for January alone.

      As the experiment progresses, there will be many changes in the design
      of the database. Be sure to read the appropriate files for the latest
      information.

*     The gopher and the web interfaces make searching for information
*     much, much easier. For ftp access, the files "form.idx" and 
      "company.idx" in the main directory list the fillings. The first is 
      ordered by the type of form, and the second by the company (both 
      contain the same information, just in different order). Entries in 
      both of these files list the file in the "data1" directory with the 
      relevant filling.

   E. Public Domain Financial Data
    
      This site allows those with financial data they would like to share to
      place it at a common site. Thus, some caution might be advised since
      the data may not be "official." Details about this site can be found
      in the "README" file and a list of the extensive set of files at this
      site can be found in the file named "ls-Lr".

+  G. QuoteCom Data Service

      This service offers a variety of data on the U.S. financial markets,
      five London exchanges, five European exchanges, and Canadian
      exchanges. Data ranges from 15 minute old prices to historical prices. 
      In addition, portfolios can be tracked and trading-oriented business 
      news can be followed. For no charge, one can receive five quotes per 
      day, along with basic balance sheet information from most any sort of 
      financial market. Additional services are fee-based (educational and 
      site licenses are available). For instance, daily data from about 9,000 
      U.S. stocks for the last five years, and daily data from 400 U.S. 
      commodity futures contracts for the last few months, are available for 
      a list price of $1.95 list per time series. Output can be viewed in a 
      number of formats, including email, ftp and the web. All users must be 
      registered.

  7. DATA ARCHIVES 

   A. Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)
 
      This organization offers a substantial amount of social science data
      in machine readable form to its 370 member colleges and universities.
      Currently, most data is available on 9-track tape, but an increasing
      amount is available on other media (CD-ROM, tape cartridges,
      diskettes, and ftp). For economists, an especially useful collection
      of data is Class V, which contains data funded by the NSF's Economics
      Division. Other data of possible interest includes the World Bank's
      World Tables Of Economic And Social Indicators, 1950-1988; the NBER's
      Macroeconomic Time Series For The United States, United Kingdom,
      Germany, And France (which has 1.6 million entries in numerous
      categories including regional data; most data is from the early part
      of this century, but a substantial amount is from the 19th century;
      the most recent is from 1968); and United States Microdata Samples
      Extract File, 1940-1980: Demographics Of Aging (which is an extract of
      the Censuses of 1960, 1970, and 1980). In addition, there is a
      substantial amount of more specialized data of likely interest to
      economists.

      In the main gopher menu, you can search their holdings in the
      directory "Archival Holdings of the ICPSR."

      To obtain data from ICPSR, you generally must contact your local
      representative, assuming that your university or college is a member
      of the ICPSR. Data is also available to individuals whose institutions
      are not members of the ICPSR.

   B. ESRC Data Archive
 
      This UK archive, funded by the University of Essex and the Economic 
      and Social Research Council, is the largest such archive in the United
      Kingdom. It holds nearly 4,000 social science computer datasets, both
      historical and contemporary, that are in some way related to the U.K.
      (about the U.K., conducted by U.K. investigators, or of interest to 
      U.K. users). For economists, datasets of particular interest include 
      the CSO Macroeconomic Databank, the Family Expenditure Survey, and the 
      Labour Force Survey. In addition, some of datasets contain multi-country 
      surveys, so other countries are frequently included. Thus, this archive 
      is of interest even to non-U.K. economists. Since the datasets are 
      held under agreement with the depositors, one must contact the archive 
      for information on how to obtain the data, some of which is available 
      online (other formats include CD-ROMs and tapes, diskette, and DAT)
 
      To search ESRC's holdings, one can easily search their database, BIRON, 
      via telnet. If an item of interest is found, further information on how 
      to obtain the data can be found via email.

  8. WORKING PAPERS AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SERVICES
  
*  A. NetEc (BibEc, WoPEc, & CodEc)
      
      This site has three parts: BibEc, a bibliography of working papers,
      in economics, WoPEc, an electronic collection of working papers, and
      CodEc, a collection of programs for economists. BibEc includes some
      35,000 entries from about 250 different working papers series. These
      series include those major of major universities and research
      institutions, including the Fed in Print database of the U.S.  Federal
      Reserve System. Fed In Print on BibEc corresponds to the print
      publication of the same title published by the Federal Reserve Bank of
      Philadelphia. It indexes major publications of all the U.S. Federal
      Reserve Banks. Coverage goes back to 1986, with scanty coverage
      earlier than that. As of April 1994 it contains approximately 6,000
      records. Updates are mounted semi-annually. In BibEc, FIP is found
      under the "U.S. Federal Reserve."

      Coverage of NetEc dates from 1988, with the exception of NBER working
      papers (all are covered), UCSD from 1981, and the Centre for Economic
      Policy Research in London from 1983. Searches can be made by keywords.
      This is one of the most valuable resources for economists on the
      Internet. Fethy Mili <mili@ere.umontreal.ca>, a librarian at the
      Universite de Montreal, maintains an extensive collection of working
      paper series. He is to be commended for entering the data. The data is
      made available at the Manchester Computing Centre. Other institutions
      provided further contributions. NetEc welcomes the participation of
      all working paper producers.

      WoPEc contains a collection of working papers, which can be
      retrieved electronically. All are Unix compressed PostScript
      files.

*     CodEc contains programs of interest to economists. For instance, Estima 
*     (who produces Rats), uses it to distribute its routines. It also 
*     contains Lin's "GAUSS Programming for Econometricians" (it has GAUSS 
*     routines for least squares, simultaneous least squares, arima models, 
*     and nonlinear optimization), Gary Langer's BCI Data Manager, as well 
*     as other programs. Information on the programs is identified by
*     "software information" files that identifies the author, a description, 
*     software required, etc. CodEc is maintained by Dirk Eddelbuettel
*     <edd@ehess.cnrs-mrs.fr>.

      Finally, the ftp site has the Backus and Kohoe data from the AER, '92 
      (see the "pub/NetEc/DatEc" directory). More data could be kept here; 
      if you have a suggestion, please send email to netec@netec.mcc.ac.uk.

   B. Working Paper Archive (econ-wp)

      This electronic archive of working papers in economics is set up by
      the Economics Department of Washington University in St. Louis. It
      uses software developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where
      literally thousands of working papers in physics are stored. This
      archive is best accessed through gopher, although email and ftp access
      is possible as well. Papers are grouped in 21 subject areas with
      abstracts and different methods of searching for papers are
      available. In addition, there are areas for datasets and computer
      programs. Papers may be submitted in any format via email and binary
      files can be submitted via ftp. If you have a properly configured web
      client (such as Mosaic) or even a properly configured gopher (such as
      Hgopher for Windows), most of the papers can be viewed fully formatted
      online. The web server also has entries for other PostScript papers
      which are available on the Net.

      The parent gopher, the gopher of the Economics Department of
      Washington University at St. Louis, contains a wealth of interesting
      material. It is the next to last entry on econ-wp's menu.

*  E. Economic Literature Index

      This is a bit of a stretch, but this electronic index of
      bibliographical entries from the Journal of Economic Literature is now
      available indirectly through the Internet. First, one must have an
      account with CompuServe (call 1-800-848-8990 for information in the
      U.S.) for this relatively low-cost method. One can log onto CompuServe
      by telneting to compuserve.com (enter "CIS" for the "Host Name").
      After entering account information and communication speed (I'd never
      done telnet at 300 bps before), move to "Reference", then to
      "Knowledge Index", which is a joint project of CompuServe and Dialog
      (it is a means for Dialog to discriminate among its customers).
      Knowledge Index is available only after business hours (6:00 PM -
      5:00AM Monday - Thursday and 6:00 PM Friday - 5:00 AM Monday local
      time; closed 2:00 - 10:00 AM Sunday, Pacific Time). The Economic
      Literature Index (known as ECON1, the only database in the Economics
      Section) is one of approximately 100 databases in Knowledge Index. In
*     Knowledge Index, first go to the "Business Information" section, then
      "General Business Information". It costs $24/hour, which doesn't seem
      to be very low in price, until you look at Dialog.

      I originally had some trouble connecting to Knowledge Index -- the
      characters were garbled. This was solved by using the Kermit version
      of telnet. I understand that Knowledge Index requires 8 data bits and
      1 stop bit, and it appears that not all telnets can do this (including
      the three I have ready access to). Kermit appears to do this by
      default. Kermit for many platforms can be obtained from
      ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit.


+     D. CARL's UnCover

      This system, run by the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries
      (CARL), offers a useful service: a large searchable database of 
      periodicals (claimed to be the world's largest, with more than 
      4,000 citations added each day). They have about 500 serials with
      "economics" in the title. Coverage dates back to 1988; if a serial
      was added since then, coverage begins at the date in which it was
      added. Perhaps more importantly, the articles can be ordered and 
      delivered via fax. Credit card payment is accepted (payments include 
      copyright fees). Thus, this could be very useful for those with poor 
      libraries. It appears that most articles cost from $10 to $15. 
      Searches are free, however.

      After logging onto the system move to "2. Current Article Indexes and 
      Access," then move to "50. UnCover -- Article Access."

+ 9. PUBLISHERS ON THE INTERNET

+  A. Elsevier/North-Holland

      Elsevier/North-Holland offers three services on the Internet for
      economists as an adjunct to their paper publishing. The first,
      "Contents Alert Economics," is a mailing list concerning forthcoming
      articles in nine of their economics journals (Economics Letters,
      European Economic Review, Information Economics & Policy, Journal of
      Econometrics, Journal of Economic Dynamics & Control, Journal of
      Empirical Finance, Journal of Mathematical Economics, Mathematical
      Social Sciences and Review of Economics & Statistics). It includes
      titles, authors, abstracts and estimated dates of future publication.
      It comes out at approximately two week intervals.

      The second service, ECONbase, is an expanded version of Contents
      Alert, in that it also contains "back issues." That is, it contains
      similar, but somewhat more detailed, information on all articles
      published from January 1, 1994 in the above mentioned journals.
      Further, this database is searchable. Access to it is restricted to
      those (i) who have a personal subscription to a North-Holland
      economics journal (this includes those who are members of an
      organization that has member subscriptions to one of these economics
      journals (EEA, EARIE, SEDC or ITS)), or (ii) whose institution has a
      subscription to two of the journals covered by ECONbase, or (iii) who
      are an editor or editorial board member of one of North-Holland's
      economics journals. If you meet one of these qualifications, you may
      register at the address given below to setup gopher access.

      Finally, North-Holland has a mailing list, ECONlist, designed for a 
      discussion of these services.

 11. ELECTRONIC JOURNALS AND NEWSPAPERS

*  A. DowVision on the Internet
 
      According to "Dow Jones to Offer News Over Internet by Mid-'94," Wall
      Street Journal, 1/27/94, p. B6, the Wall Street Journal will be
      available over the Internet by the middle of this year. To quote: "The
      service, to be called DowVision on the Internet, will include the full
      text of the Wall Street Journal, and same-day text of the Yew York
      Times News Service, the Dow Jones News Service, Dow Jones
      International News Service and press-release services.... Dow Jones
      said it will charge a flat monthly fee, still to be determined."

      In "Curtain's Rising on a Third Generation of On-Line Services," John
      Markoff, New York Times, 1/30/94, p. 10 (Business), more is reported
      on this service. It says that wais, gopher and web interfaces will be
      used for this experiment, which is offered in a joint venture between
      Dow Jones and Wais, Inc. The New York Times News Service will be offered 
      next year.

*     To follow up on above material, "DowVision on the Internet" is now in
*     pre-alpha testing (it shows in surprisingly few places). It can be
*     accessed at the address listed below, and through the email address,
*     you will be notified when it becomes commercially available. Currently,
*     that is projected to be in the fourth quarter.

   B. Cyberchronicle of Political Economy (COPE)

      This journal is the first refereed electronic economics journal on the
      Internet. To quote from the introductory material, "COPE features
      brief articles, book reviews, comments and replies regarding
      previously published materials, and brief abstracts of articles
      published elsewhere." Since all work is electronic, one very nice
      feature of this journal is rapid turnaround: it is expected to be 6
      months from submission to publication.

      Publication is to be bimonthly, and papers will be distributed via
      email. LaTeX will be used since it offers many advantages for
      technical papers.

+12. ECONOMIC SOCIETIES AND ORGANIZATIONS

   A. Economic History Server operated by the Cliometric Society

      Sponsored by the Cliometric Society, this gopher contains information
      of interest to economic historians. It features an electronic
      directory of the memberships of the Cliometric Society and the
      Economic History Association. It also contains a collection of more
      than 40 course syllabi from economic history courses, abstracts from
      Cliometric sessions at ASSA meetings, a list of papers presented at
      Cliometrics Conferences (1961-1993), and a growing set of historical
      data series. (Sam Williamson, who helped start this gopher, kindly
      provided this description.)

   B. National Bureau of Economic Research 
      
      Currently, this gopher contains several things of interest: the Penn
      World Tables (versions 5 and 5.5), the Survey of Consumer Finance
      (which will fit on three floppies), trade and immigration data from
      Abowd and Freeman, and a list of NBER working papers and reprints
      (which must first be uudecoded then uncompressed; the ultimate size is
      some 2.5 megabytes). The latter is also available at BibEc. Note that
      not all data is available with both the ftp and gopher methods; in
      particular, of the data, only the Penn World Tables are available on
      the gopher site.

      For the Penn World tables, an extensive set of macros for the Excel
      spreadsheet program can be found in pub/pwt55.spreadsheet. For more
      information on this set of macros, contact the author, Sailesh Tanna
      <skt@le.ac.uk>.

      One can only hope that someday NBER working papers will be available
      here or on another working paper archive.

 14. UNIVERSITY AND RESEARCH LIBRARY CARD CATALOGS

   A. Research Libraries in General

      The most current list of research libraries accessible over the
      Internet is maintained by Billy Barron (who started it),
      Marie-Christine Mahe, Lou Rosenfeld and Barry Bouwsma. It lists
      roughly 710 such libraries.

      Note that many libraries can also be reached via gopher (typically
      under a title like "Libraries"). The following files describe how the
      libraries can be reached via telnet and the type of indexing software
      they use.

      Via the gopher listed below, one can directly connect to the libraries
      listed in the ftp files.

      ftp://ftp.utdallas.edu/pub/staff/billy/libguide (there are many
            files of interest in this directory)

   B. Library of Congress

      The Library of Congress has set up a gopher that includes a wealth of
      information, including their card catalog. They also offer an extensive
      set of links to other resources (the economics oriented ones are
      generally described elsewhere here) and substantial information on the
      U.S. Government, including Congress. It _appears_ one can use their
      photocopy service long distance.

   C. North Carolina State University's "Library Without Walls"

      This library is a forerunner of libraries of the future. It contains
      a "Reference Desk" which has dictionaries, directories, indices, and
      subject guides to literature and the Internet. It also has "Study
      Carrels" which are devoted to different subject areas.

 15. PROGRAM LIBRARIES

   A. Netlib

      Netlib is a numerical software library with approximately 50 megabytes
      of code. The routines, mostly in Fortran, are generally of high
      quality (many were developed at U.S. national labs or by professional
      numerical analysts). Packages include Linpack, Eispack, and their
      successor, Lapack.

      Netlib is available via email, ftp and gopher. For introductory
      material on Netlib, use the email method by writing "send index" in
      the body of your message addressed to one of the sites listed below.
      You will receive an introduction to Netlib and its libraries and how
      to obtain routines from them.

      At least the netlib2 site contain some uncompressed files.

   B. Statlib

      Statlib is a system similar to Netlib (in fact, it uses roughly the
      same email software) for statistical software. Major holding include
      algorithms from Applied Statistics, numerous classic datasets 
      (although few are economic), software for Minitab and S, and a variety
      of other software under a heading labeled "general."

      For the email interface, send the phrase "send index" in the body of
      your message.

 16. EDUCATIONAL SERVICES

*  A. Iowa Electronic Markets

      This service is run by the Accounting and Economics Departments of the
      University of Iowa. It currently consists of markets in two broad
      areas: political races, and financial market securities. Current
      political markets include the Texas senatorial and gubernatorial
      races, the Utah 2nd Congressional District, the Virginia general
      election for the U.S. Senate, and the majority party in the November
*     U.S. Congressional elections.

*     I could be mistaken, but there currently appear to be no markets on
*     financial market instruments. I imagine this will soon change with the
      start of the school year. The liquidation value of all contracts is
      determined by the value of the underlying fundamental on a set date,
      and trading takes place interactively through a telnet connection.

      In the past, these departments ran the well known 1992 Iowa Political
      Stock Market, which traded contracts based on the outcome of the 1992
      Presidential Election.

      This excellent teaching tool is open only to university and college
      staff, faculty and students. While the purpose is education and
      research, trades require actual money (from $5 to $500 may be
      invested). The developers feel that by using real money for trades,
      there is an increased motivation to learn about the underlying
      fundamentals. There are no commissions or fees and  trading is
*     continuous. Trading takes place in both English  and German.

             Directions: mail addressed here will

 17. USENET NEWSGROUPS

     Usenet is a decentralized discussion system running on tens of
     thousands of cooperating computers around the world (much of the
     traffic runs over the Internet). It covers some 6,000 subjects in areas
     called newsgroups. The estimated number of readers ranges in the low
     millions and traffic each day is approaching 50 megabytes. Some mailing
     lists "mirror" Usenet newsgroups and vice-versa.

     In many ways, Usenet has it own culture and the new user is wise to
     read carefully before posting messages. The newsgroups
     news.announce.newusers and news.newusers.questions are for those new to
     Usenet. Since it runs on a variety of systems, consult your local site
     for information on how to access it.

 18. MAILING LISTS

   A. Introduction

      Mailing lists work as follows. Software on a computer run by the
      organizer (or moderator) of the list sends mail to all members of the
      list when it receives mail. For obvious reasons, the term mail
      exploder is sometimes used for such software. On some lists, the
      moderator will approve mail to be sent to all list members. Thus, to
      send mail to all members, you need only write to one address: the list
      address.

      When using a mailing list, please follow "netiquette:"
       - Use a meaningful subject line. A subject of "help", particularly
         when received by those on more than one list, is not likely to
         elicit much of a response.
       - If you're responding to a previous post, quote accordingly, but
         judiciously. This helps put your comments in context, yet avoids
         messages that are too long. 
       - Enclose a short note (or "signature") at the bottom with at least
         your email address. Some mailing systems mangle the information in
         the header with your address.
       - If you have a response, consider responding directly via email if 
         you think no one on the list will be interested.
       - Watch your temper. Email sometimes makes tempers flare. If you think
         you should wait or tone down your note, you most likely should.
       - Don't type in all capital letters.
*      - Finally, employ common courtesy. If someone helps you out, a thank
*        you will be appreciated.

      While not part of netiquette, the value of mailing lists should be
      approached like other many other sources of information, such as a
      newspaper or a journal. Much of the material may not be of interest,
      but occasionally something very useful may cross your path.

   #########################################################################
   #     Note that in ALL cases, you subscribe and unsubscribe from a      #
   #     list NOT by sending email to the list itself (which means it      #
   #     goes to ALL the members of the list), but to some special         #
   #     address that deals with subscriptions. Sending mail to the        #
   #     list itself marks you as a novice who hasn't taken time to        #
   #     carefully read directions. It also irritates list members         #
   #     (numbering into the hundreds) who receive useless mail. One       #
   #     hint: when subscribing to a list, you'll receive information      #
   #     on how to unsubscribe. Keep it and use it.                        #
   #########################################################################

      The following is a list of email discussion groups. I have organized
      the following mailing lists around the type of software (listserv,
      listproc, majordomo, mailserv, mailbase, Internet-style, and other)
      used to run them so that directions can be put in one place.

      In general, I know little about these lists other than the fact that
      they exist (in fact, this list is basically an edited version of the
      email I received in acknowledgment when I subscribed to the lists).
      Traffic varies; in fact, on some, it is very close to zero, on others,
      it varies, and on others, it is substantial. Where I do know something
      more, I've added it beneath the name of the list and its address.

      If you need help on subscribing to a list, most mailing list software
      supports the "help" command. Thus, if you're uncertain on how to
      subscribe to Pol-Econ, send email to listserv@SHSU.edu and type the
      word help in the body of your message.


   B. Single Topic Mailing Lists 

      LISTSERV 

      To subscribe to a list run by listserv (which actually covers several
      different types of software which share the same name and common core
      commands) send an email message to LISTSERV@wherever, _NOT_ to the
      list itself. If you send mail to the list itself, it will be sent in
      turn to all members of the list. This, obviously, should be reserved
      for messages you want all members of the list to read and potentially
      respond to.

      For example, to subscribe to the list Pol-Econ, you'd send email to 
      listserv@SHSU.edu.

      In the body of your email message, if your name is Adam Smith, you 
      would write the one line message:  
      subscribe Pol-Econ Adam Smith 
*     Note that your name is typically your first and last name. Be sure to
*     remove any signature at the bottom of your message to avoid confusing
*     the mail software.

      To cancel a subscription, use 
      signoff list 
      where list is the name of the list. Again, email should be sent to 
      listserv at the site that houses the list. Finally, help on these and 
      other commands can be obtained by sending a one line message with 
      "help" in it.

      Messages to the list itself should be sent to Pol-Econ@SHSU.edu, 
      for example. Any such message will be sent to all members of the list.

        in that group. Discussions range over all of economics. Since the
        traffic is fairly heavy, you can choose to have all messages sent
        in one message once a day in a digest. Rather than subscribing to
        Pol-Econ, subscribe to Pol-Econ-Digest. If you'd like to switch
        from Pol-Econ to Pol-Econ-Digest, first use the command to

      LISTPROC
 
      Listproc is roughly the Unix version of listserv. Commands for 
*     subscribing and unsubscribing are identical (see the above directions 
*     for listserv). However, mail containing the commands is sent to 
*     "listproc" rather than to "listserv" (some listprocs masquerade as 
*     listservs, but this distinction is meaningless for simple commands such 
*     as subscribing and unsubscribing).

 19. DATA RELATED TO THE ECONOMICS PROFESSION

   A. Graduate Programs

      Forrest Smith, the moderator of the Usenet newsgroup
      sci.econ.research, has compiled information on some graduate programs
      in economics. The archive site for this group is mentioned below, and
      this information can be found in the "FAQ" directory with the names
      "grad.programs.descriptive" and "grad.progs.contents".

      ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/academic/economics/sci.econ.research


   B. Directory of Economists on the Internet (Sam Houston State)

      This directory contains a list of economists who use the Internet. It
      includes their affiliation, regular and email address, phone and fax
      numbers, and research areas. The directory can easily be searched.

      Its main site is at the Sam Houston State University Gopher (described
      above, where the Economics section is run by George Greenwade), and is
      located on many economics gophers. On this gopher, there is an entry
      to fill out this information interactively via telnet, or you can fill
      in the following template and send it to Gopher-Mgr@SHSU.edu. In the
      template, each field should begin in column 9.

      This electronic version of the directory is offered by the AEA and the

      contains addresses, phone numbers, research fields, and biographical
      data from the most recent survey of members, but no email addresses.
      Note that updates should NOT be sent here, but to the AEA. The
      directory has a fairly sophisticated search capability (but only the
      first 256 matches will be returned). However, one must be a bit
      thoughtful in using it. For instance, if I wanted to find all
      economists in Mississippi, I might search for MS. However, this will
      not match Miss. or Mississippi, and it will match Adams and those with
      MS degrees (searches are not restricted to one particular field and
      are not case sensitive).

 20. WORD PROCESSING
 
*  A. TeX and LaTeX References

*     TeX is a typesetting system that was developed by the computer
*     scientist Donald Knuth of Stanford. To make it easier to use, a
*     very extensive set of TeX macros, known as LaTeX, have been developed.
*     Versions of it are widely, if not exclusively, for word processing in 
*     math and physics. In part, this stems from the ease in which one can 
*     type equations. In addition, LaTeX has an interesting philosophy:
*     you design the logical structure of the document, and LaTex handles
*     the physical output. This makes a number of things easier. For instance,
*     if you wish to add a section, you don't have to retype all the other
*     section numbers; LaTeX handles this automatically. Or, if you decide
*     to change the presentation style of equations, you can make the change
*     in one place, rather than equation by equation.

*     For TeX, let me cite two references. The first one is the classic,
*     while the second one contains information on the huge number of macros
*     and ancillary programs for TeX.

      The TeXbook, Donald Knuth, Addison Wesley, 1984, ISBN 0-201-13447-0, 
      paperback 0-201-13448-9

*     Making TeX Work, Norman Walsh, O'Reilly and Associates, 1994,
*     ISBN 1-56592-051-1.

*     For LaTex, let me also give two references. The first is the second 
*     edition of the classic LaTeX reference. It covers the new version of 
*     LaTeX, LaTeX2e. To be honest, I often find its technical appendix
*     to be of more use than the chapters. The second reference is designed 
*     as a very detailed companion for the first.

*     LaTeX, a Document Preparation System, 2nd ed., Leslie Lamport, Addison 
*     Wesley, 1994, ISBN 0-201-52983-1

*     The LaTeX Companion, Michel Gossens, Frank Mittelbach, and Alexander
*     Samarin, Addison-Wesley, 1994, ISBN 0-201-54199-8.


*  B. TeX Macros for Economics and TeX/LaTeX Sources

      Since I am not a TeX user, let me defer to George Greenwade
      <bed_gdg@SHSU.edu>, who is. In fact, he is an expert. This section was 
      written by George and I simply copied it from his posting to the Usenet 
      newsgroup sci.econ.research as archived by Forrest Smith.

      The TeX macros written by Professor Varian, known as
      "VerTeX" (for Visualize Economic Reports in TeX; release
      1.0 of August, 1987) are available for ftp retrieval from
      the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN) hosts:
 
         hostname               directory
      --------------------------------------------------------------
      ftp.SHSU.edu         /tex-archive/macros/plain/contrib/vertex/
      ftp.TeX.ac.UK        /tex-archive/macros/plain/contrib/vertex/
*     ftp.dante.DE         /tex-archive/macros/plain/contrib/vertex/

      The first two sites also support gopher access. SHSU's
      CTAN is also linked into Niord's gopher in its Economics
      area, as well as the economics or TeX areas on a number of
      other gophers worldwide.

      Finally, the command:
       SENDME VERTEX
      in the body of a mail message to FILESERV@SHSU.edu will 
      retrieve the set of 19 files via email.

      I have to stress that these are NOT LaTeX styles; they are
      TeX macros. VerTeX's syntax differs somewhat from the more
      standard LaTeX-type commands; however, the syntax used in
      VerTeX is consistent throughout VerTeX (and, as an
      occasional user, I feel comfortable in saying they are
      relatively easy to follow, understand, and use). The file
      set is pretty well documented and demonstrated. Varian has
      very roughly hinted that he might have an interest at some
      later date in rewriting these to use LaTeX and BibTeX
      (probably after the release of LaTeX3 -- since I am quite
      involved in that project, I feel safe in telling you not to
      hold your breath on LaTeX3; I'll be surprised if it's out
      before 1996).

      The present Visualize Economic Reports in TeX styles include:
       jpe.sty    --- Journal of Polemical Economy
       jep.sty    --- Journal of Economic Perspectives
       jet.sty    --- Journal of Economic Theorems
       aer.sty    --- Armenian Economic Review
       ecnmet.sty --- Economagica
       restud.sty --- Review for Economic Students
       qje.sty    --- Quartered Journal of Economics

      I'll assume that you can figure out which of these look
      like what "real" journals. When you use one of these
      styles, VerTeX will automatically adjust the style of the
      document and the style of the references to be more-or-less
      consistent with the journal style. Some fine tuning may be
      needed, but the output generally looks pretty good.

      As the US coordinator of the CTAN (a collection now in
      excess of a gigabyte), if you have any TeX-related files
      which you would like to have included, please contact me.


 21. PROGRAMS FOR ECONOMISTS ON THE INTERNET

   A. BCI Data Manager Version 2.0

      For this section, let me quote from a post by the author 
      (Gary F. Langer), with just a bit of editing:

      BCI Data Manager is a Windows 3.1 program that lets you manage the
      economic time series contained in the U.S. Commerce Department's
      Business Cycle Indicators (BCI) and Current Business Statistics (BSDC)
      database files. Together, these data files, updated weekly and
      monthly, contain current and historic data on over 2000 data series.
      BCI files contain all of the time series included in the "yellow
      pages" of the Survey of Current Business, going back to 1945, and
      always contain the very latest revisions. Current Business Statistics
      files contain all the economic time series found in the "blue pages"
      of the Survey of Current Business, going back four years. These files
      are available on the Commerce Department's Economics Bulletin Board
      (EBB) and on a subscription basis. You can access the EBB via telnet
      through ebb.stat-usa.gov, or via modem at (202)482-3870. BCI and BSDC
      files can also be obtained through ftp from the U. of Michigan:

      ftp://una.hh.lib.umich.edu/bin

      The main purpose of BCI Data Manager is to extract data from these
      data files and save it in a useful format. You can choose to save
      extracted data as an ASCII file (CSV format), as a spreadsheet file
      (WK1 format), or to the Windows clipboard. (You can also
      interactively view the data on-line if you like). Range names are
      saved in the WK1 files to facilitate importing the data into word-
      processing documents and external databases. Graphs of each series
      extracted can also be saved in the WK1 file containing the data, at
      the option of the user.

      The program also enables you to keep historic database files
      up-to-date with an automated update facility. The Commerce Department
      issues weekly and monthly updates of the last two and four years of
      data for all of its BCI data series, but unless this data can be
      integrated into the historic database files that go back to 1945, it
      is of limited usefulness. By essentially clicking on files to be
      updated and clicking on the files containing the updated data, the
      program will automatically add the updated and revised data to
      existing historic data files.

      Another feature of the program is its ability to display graphs of all
      of the series contained in the database with a single click of the
      mouse. With a single tap of the up or down arrow keys you can scroll
      through graphs of all of the series on your computer as if you were
      turning through the pages of a book. With another mouse click you can
      switch the display from that of quarterly or monthly data to that of
      annual data. I've found that this feature is excellent for in-class
      and seminar slide (or screen) show presentations.

      The directory "/pub/NetEc/SoftEc/BCI_Manager" contains two
      subdirectories, "/zipped" and "/unzipped". "/zipped" contains a
      compressed file named "BCI_V20.ZIP" which contains BCI Data Manager
      and all its supporting files (in another compressed file named
      "BCI20.ZIP"), along with  some instructions. You will need PKUNZIP to
      uncompress "BCI_V20.ZIP" and "BCI20.ZIP". "/unzipped" contains all of
      the files in "BCI_V20.ZIP" in uncompressed form (to run the program
      you need _all_ of the files contained in "/unzipped").

      If you use the program and like it, send me email and I will send you
      information about later versions of it (I tinker with it endlessly).
      (Also send email if you would like me to send you the program on a
      floppy diskette via surface mail.)

      ftp://netec.mcc.ac.uk/pub/NetEc/SoftEc/BCI_Manager (the program
           can be obtained from either the zipped (using PKZIP) or 
           unzipped directories (be sure to get all files))

*  C. Software
  
      Gopher Client Software

      Gopher is a very popular tool on the Internet and is much more
      efficient than accessing gopher sites with telnet. Further, file
      transfer is much easier with client software. Packages for many
      different hosts can be found here.

      Mosaic Client Software

*     Client software for Mosaic, sometimes called the "killer application"
*     of the Internet, can be found here.

      uuencode/uudecode

      This pair of programs are very useful when used in conjunction with
      email. Uuencode takes a binary file (such as a word processing file or
      a program) and converts it to text so that it can be emailed. Uudecode
      than converts it back to binary. Using this pair of programs,
      researchers can collaborate by emailing binary data or word processing
      files. If one host is an IBM mainframe, be sure to use the -x option.

      gzip

      This program can uncompress many files (note that this is typically
      denoted by a .Z or .gz suffix) found on the Internet. More information
      on this topic can be found below in the document by David Lemson.

   D. General Guides to Resources 

      Scott Yanoff's "Internet Services List"

      Scott Yanoff produces a list of interesting resources on the Internet.
      While few of them are economics (and those that are covered above)
      many are quite interesting and useful. One I find particularly
      interesting is the University of Illinois weather gopher -- you can
      find weather forecasts for any part of the country. Another
      interesting resource is books.com, a bookstore on the Internet. For
      those that live in rather small towns like me, this is a very valuable
      service.

      Yanoff's list is well worth looking at for those new to the Internet.

      ftp://csd4.csd.uwm.edu/pub/inet.services.txt


      John December's "Information Sources: the Internet 
      and Computer-Mediated Communication"

      This document has a broader concept than Yanoff's; rather than listing
      just resources, December lists a number of documents as well, such as
      electronic guides to the Internet, and software sites. The breadth is
      quite remarkable. Like Yanoff's list, those new to the Internet will
      find it quite useful.

      File Compression, Archiving, and Text<->Binary Formats:

      This document, by David Lemson <lemson@uiuc.edu> details the numerous
      methods of file compression used on the Internet and elsewhere.

+  G. Usenet FAQs

      FAQs are Frequently Asked Questions (and answers) from the Usenet
      discussion system. They cover a very wide variety of topics; a quick
      check of recent FAQs found them on the following topics:  drum corps,
      medical image formats, culture in Canada, European Union basics, pool
      and billiards, computer research, linear programming, hockey, finding
      craft suppliers, SCSI computer peripherals, reggae music,
      locksmithing, DESKview, FoxPro, cats, and electrical wiring. This
      document is the FAQ for the newsgroup sci.econ.research. In all,
      nearly 1000 different newsgroups have such documents. While some can
      be very useful, be sure to remember the adage: "they're worth what
      you pay for them."

      guides for various subjects that are on the Internet. Thus, if you're
      looking for information available on the Internet, this is a good
      place to look. This guide is located here.

 23. NON-INTERNET RESOURCES

   A. Introduction

      While this document is primarily about resources on the Internet of
      interest to economists, there are several resources not on the
      Internet that might be of interest. I hasten to add that I have not
      tried any of these and am only reporting what I have read elsewhere.


*  B. Federal Reserve Bank Bulletin Boards

*     Robert Rycroft <rrycroft@s850.mwc.edu> was nice enough to contribute
*     the following information, which greatly expanded upon my previous work
*     here. I have edited his text slightly. Perhaps, someday, they will join
*     other government affiliated data providers and place this material on
*     the Internet.

*     Dallas  (214) 922-5199   Provides national data on employment,
*     unemployment and labor force from the household survey, prices and
*     wages, and industrial production and capacity utilization. Also 
*     leading, lagging and coincident indicators. There is a lot of regional
*     data and material from the Center for Latin American Economies. Other
*     material is here too.

*     Minneapolis  (612) 340-2489  Provides 59 files worth of national
*     economic data, abstracts of articles from Review, district and national
*     economic summaries, FOMC minutes, biographies of Fed officials,
*     speeches, material on coin and currency, and the gold standard and 
*     other material.

*     St. Louis  (314) 621-1824  This makes available a wide variety of data,
*     including U.S. financial data, monetary aggregates, interest rates,
*     reserves, loans, GDP and components, CPI, PPI, employment and
*     population, and international data. Also there are Fed Statistical
*     Releases, and it provides the data used in each of the empirical
*     articles that appear in the St. Louis Review (teachers could make use
*     of that).

*     New York Fed (212) 720-2652  It provides daily or weekly data on
*     bankers acceptances, commercial paper rates, exchange rates, interest
*     rates, money supply, reserves, and treasury securities. Also a weekly
*     bulletin, biographies of officials, speeches, and news releases.


   C. On-Line Refereed Economics Journal

      I understand that a bulletin board run by Steven W. Dickey of Eastern
      Kentucky University "publishes" refereed articles. He can be contacted
      at (606) 622-4987, and the bulletin board is at (601) 624-3934, UARTS
      2400, 8-N-1.
