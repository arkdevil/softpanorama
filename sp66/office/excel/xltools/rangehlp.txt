				RANGE

For Excel Macro Language programmers.  Finds the minimum rectangle which 
surrounds all the cells containing values.  When your macro wishes to 
insert a formula into an area of the spreadsheet, RANGE reduces 
recalculation time by identifying the smallest area which must be filled.  
For example, this is useful in designing cellular games like LIFE, in 
which the location and size of each generation changes.  RANGE will 
identify all active cells, or it can be used to find all cells having a 
specified value in a complex population.

RANGE returns the rectangle it finds as text.  It also selects the 
rectangle on the spreadsheet.  This means that after RANGE is called, the 
selected area is ready to be manipulated.  RANGE returns FALSE if it fails 
to find any cells containing values.

RANGE takes two arguments: the definition of the active cell, and whether 
to do a positive or negative search.

A negative search finds all cells which do not have values.  The definition 
of a blank cell need not be that it is empty.  For instance, it might be 
desirable to flag cells containing 0 as empty.  The significance of the 
first argument in this case is that it defines the contents of a null cell.

A positive search finds all cells which have a certain value.  The first 
argument in this case specifies the contents of a full cell.
