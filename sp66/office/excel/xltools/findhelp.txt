					FINDFILE

For Excel Macro Language programmers.  FINDFILE addresses one of the most 
common requirements in producing Macro Language driven applications: 
security that the currently active sheet is the correct one on which to 
perform the actions.  FIND_AND_OPEN_FILE is inserted as the first 
executable line of every routine in which there is any chance of harm if 
the wrong spreadsheet is active.  In particular, this means every routine 
which a user might directly select from the men u or a dialog box.  It is 
very fast, returns FALSE if it cannot find and activate the spreadsheet, 
and will both activate and load from the file system.

This code is inserted directly into the macro sheet under development.  It 
is fully documented and its use is unrestricted.

FIND_AND_OPEN_FILE accepts one argument: the name of the desired active 
file.  It determines whether this is the current active file.  If it is 
not active, it attempts to activate it.  If the file is not open, it 
attempts to find it and open it.  Returns FALSE when unsuccessful, and 
returns the name of the file when successful.

There are two subordinate routines, which may be called directly, since 
they also take the name argument.  One identifies whether the file is 
currently open.  The other identifies whether the file is available in the 
directory.  These routines perform no action; they only return information.
