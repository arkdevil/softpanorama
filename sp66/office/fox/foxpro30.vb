Interesting... I thought Access's strength was in client/server networking.
Which FP version was crashing which Novell?  Also Access being "hands down"
better than FP is silly.  Maybe if you need certain c/s or vb compatibility
but it needs 6Mb RAM (not cool for most PCs) to run and will not run dBase
apps.  And Borland?  Aren't they sorta going under?  Who would you trust
with a Windows based database on the first attempt too, Borland or Microsoft?
Neither, right ;-)
 
On the FP 3.0 front, will it include the vb language and still run in 4Mb?
When is it SUPPOSED to be out and what other goodies besides an OO develop-
ment environment?
