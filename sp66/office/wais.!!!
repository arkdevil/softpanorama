SOME COMPANIES PREFER WAIS FOR BUILDING IN-HOUSE DATABASES

        Increasingly, companies are building their own internal databases
with WAIS (Wide Area Information Server).
        KPMG Peat Marwick recently unveiled a WAIS (pronounced wayz)
database for internal use. Other companies that use WAIS include Lockheed
Corp. and Booz Allen and Hamilton Inc.
        The database allows Peat Marwick partners and consultants, for
example, to gather information on prospective clients or find employees
with specific job skills. It is divided into sections, including resumes,
reports, skills, proposals and work-in-progre ss.
        "Information is our business," said Jeff Ott, manager of Peat
Marwick's client server consulting group. "It's critical in an
organization our size that the right hand know what the left hand is
doing."
        Robin Palmer, senior manager of the client serve consulting group,
said the accounting firm chose WAIS over Gopher for two key reasons:
        *Its simplicity in constructing searches using plain English
queries.
        *Its ability to feed back information after a first search in order
to conduct a secondary search.
        "It could be thousands of words in a document, and you can feed
that back in," Palmer said. "That is very, very powerful."
        It is unclear whether Peat Marwick will make part of its WAIS
database publicly available once its San Francisco bay area offices
establish a 56Kb per second Internet connection via BARRnet. Said Ott: "We
have not decided whether we want to be [accountin g] information
publishers yet. It may be a little too progressive at this time."
        Peat Marwick is the only big accounting firm to use WAIS.
