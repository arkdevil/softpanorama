U.S. ROBOTICS BEGINS SHIPPING NEW GENERATION OF PRODUCTS:
SHIPS FIRST ITU-T V.34 MODEM TODAY

V.34 Ensures Compatibility, Provides Performance Improvements

SKOKIE, Ill., -- August 18, 1994 -- U.S. Robotics, Inc.
(NASDAQ: USRX) today shipped its first V.34 product,
the Courier "V.Everything" modem, making the company
one of the first in the industry to ship a truly ITU-T V.34-
compliant product.  Courier products with V.34 support are
available immediately, with PCMCIA, LAN-based,
rackmount and additional desktop products supporting V.34
to ship throughout the fall.

The Courier "V.Everything" includes the ITU-T V.34
standard for 28.8 Kbps communications.  It is also
backward-compatible with the Rockwell V.Fast Class 28.8
Kbps protocol and the AT&T V.32 terbo 19.2 Kbps
protocol, as well as the ITU-T V.32 bis standard and other
lower speed standards.  Using U.S. Robotics' DSP-based
technology, the Courier architecture provides the flexibility
to include multiple high-speed protocols, ensuring a
connection at the highest speed possible with virtually any
modem on the market.

"We have a tremendous advantage in bringing products to
market quickly, because we've invested in developing our
own DSP-based core architecture," said Jonathan Zakin,
U.S. Robotics executive vice president.  "This architecture
is used in all our products, giving us the ability to leverage
our development efforts by sharing technology across our
desktop, portable, rackmount and LAN-based products."

U.S. Robotics will ship V.34-compliant Sportster desktop
modems by the end of August.  Also in late August, the
company will ship two V.34-compliant LAN-based
products, the Shared Access LAN modem 2.0 and the Shared
Access COM server, both designed for remote LAN access.
The company's other V.34-compliant products, slated to
ship this fall, include V.34 PCMCIA and rackmount
products.

"V.34 is the enabling platform for a variety of applications,"
added Zakin.  "Applications such as telecommuting, Internet
access and remote LAN access will immediately become
more usable.  The increased bandwidth will also open the door
for manufacturers to more easily craft integrated
communications products for use over dial-up lines -- products
supporting technologies such as video or voice
communications."

V.34 Field Trials, Compatibility Testing

The company recently concluded a field trial of its V.34
Courier modems, distributing V.34 units to a wide variety
of corporate and individual users for real-world field testing.
Additionally, U.S. Robotics and other companies who
manufacture modems and modem chipsets have worked
together to ensure that products from different
manufacturers will be compatible.

"We've worked with a number of companies to ensure that
most of the problems are ironed out up front," said U.S.
Robotics' Dale Walsh, vice president of advanced
development and a member of the ITU-T study group that
developed the V.34 standard.  "It helps everyone to make
sure that our products interoperate."

"The ITU-T has done a lot of work to make V.34 a very
robust standard," added Walsh.  "V.34 will allow 28,800
bps connections more often than the V.FC protocol.  It will
also improve performance overall, because of some of the
advanced features included in the standard, such as rate
switching and improved training sequences."

Upgrades for existing Courier products are available
immediately.  Courier V.Fast Class products are upgradable
for free via software download.  Other Courier upgrade
paths vary; many Couriers are upgradable via daughterboard
swap, ranging in cost from $99 to $199.

U.S. Robotics, Inc., (NASDAQ:USRX), is a leading
designer, manufacturer and marketer of data
communications systems and products.  Both corporate
headquarters and manufacturing operations are based in
Skokie, Illinois.  U.S. Robotics owns and operates U.S.
Robotics Ltd. in Slough, England, U.S. Robotics, s.a. in
Lille, France and P.N.B. s.a., based in Suresnes, France.
The company markets its products to business, industry,
government agencies and original equipment manufacturers,
and to end-users through the personal computer distribution
channel.
