This list manager lets you deal with large sets of data in Windows
protected mode, while incurring very little overhead. It is
designed to handle very large lists of data, but there is one
catch: each element must be the same size, or at least have a known
maximum size. I have been using it for some time, and with all kinds
of different list types (even for large Windows bitmaps, which had to
be broken into less-than-32K bands), and it seems to be pretty solid.

I am not requesting any cash donations for this.  All I request is that
if you make some improvements to it, or you yourself have come up with a 
better list manager, that you show me what you have.  I'm only putting
this out there because this API has worked very well for me, and I suspect
there are a few Windows programmers out there who could make just as much 
use of it as I have, especially considering the cumbersome nature of the 
stock Windows memory management system.
