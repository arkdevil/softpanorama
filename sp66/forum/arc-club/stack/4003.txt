      BACKGROUND
      
      Stacker works great on DOS-based palmtop computers with hard RAM
      drives. However, the regular Setup will not run on a palmtop
      since it does not have a floppy drive.
      
                                    Note
         It is important to remember that the Software License
         Agreement provides you with ONE copy of Stacker. Therefore,
         you can transfer Stacker to the palmtop, but provisions of
         the agreement assume you'll delete it from any other computer.
                                      
      
      SOLUTION
      
      You will need a second "host" computer with a hard disk and file
      transfer capability to the palmtop.  The host computer should
      have at least  6 MB of free space on the hard disk. Before
      beginning, review your palmtop's instructions concerning booting
      from ROM.
      
       1.  Run the Stacker Setup program on the host computer.
           Personalize the Stacker files when requested by entering
           your name and company name. When offered the option of doing
           an Express or Custom Setup, choose "Custom".
       2.  Allow Setup to copy the Stacker files to the default
           directory.
       3.  When you are presented with the screen "Entire Drive or Free
           Space?", choose Free Space. The next screen will ask how
           much free space to use. Choose a size about 200k smaller
           than your palmtop ram card. (Minus any "boot" files you
           require.)
       4.  Reboot the host computer so the Stacker compressed drive is
           mounted.  Transfer all the files from the palmtop to that
           Stacker drive. Make sure that the files CONFIG.SYS,
           AUTOEXEC.BAT, and COMMAND.COM are among the files
           transferred.
       5.  Delete everything but the "boot" files from your palmtop ram
           card.  Boot files are the DOS system files and device
           drivers installed in the Config.sys file.
       6.  Create a STACKER directory on your palmtop. Transfer
           STACKER.COM, SSWAP.COM, and CONFIG.EXE to it. Transfer the
           STACVOL.000 file you created to the root directory of the
           ram card.
       7.  On the palmtop, rename the STACVOL.000 file to STACVOL.DSK.
           At the root directory of the palmtop type:
           REN STACVOL.000  STACVOL.DSK
       8.  From the root directory of the palmtop, type
            CONFIG /=P-  <ENTER>
           Answer "Y" for yes when the program offers to make changes
           to the STACKER.INI file for you.
       9.  Restart the palmtop computer. The Setup is complete.
       10. On the host computer, use the UNCOMP command to uncompress
           the Stacker drive. Delete all Stacker files from the host
           computer.
