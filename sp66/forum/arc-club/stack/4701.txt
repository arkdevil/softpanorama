                   RESTORING DAMAGED STACVOL FILE HEADERS
                          (Applies to Stacker 4.x)

      BACKGROUND
      
      This document addresses the error messages:
          Not a Stacker Stacvol file-NOT MOUNTED
          Invalid # reserved sectors (must be one) - NOT MOUNTED
           
      Each Stacker drive is actually a STACVOL.xxx file that is stored
      on the uncompressed drive. This file consists of a header that
      contains control information about how and where your data is
      stored, and a data area that contains all of your compressed
      data. If you receive one of the messages above, the header is
      damaged. However, Stacker saves a copy of the header for each
      Stacker drive. You may use this saved header to restore your
      STACVOL file.
      
      SOLUTION
      
          - Determine which saved header to use in the recovery process.
          - Restore the header using REPAIR.EXE.
           
      Determine which saved header to use.
      
      Note: These instructions assume that the Stacvol file on drive C
      is the one that is damaged. If the damaged file is on another
      drive, substitute that drive letter for C.
      
      Stacker frequently saves header information. When you start your
      computer, CHECK /WP saves the header as STACSAVQ.nnn; and when
      you start Windows or use the CHECK tool, the header is saved as
      STACSAVE.nnn. You must determine which of these files is newer.
      
       1. Start your computer, using a floppy disk if necessary.
       2. At the DOS prompt, change to the root directory of your C
          drive and type:
           DIR STACSAV*.* /AH <enter>
       3. Notice whether the file with the latest date and time is
          STACSAVE or STACSAVQ.
           
      Restore the header
      
       1.  You must clear the system, hidden, and read-only attributes
           from the STACVOL file. Place your Stacker disk one in drive
           A or B, and type:
           A:\TOOLS\CSA C: <enter>
           or
           B:\TOOLS\CSA C: <enter>
       2.  Type:
           DIR C:\STACVOL.* <enter>
           and record the exact spelling of the STACVOL file name. You
           will use this file name in the next step.
           
       3.  If the latest saved header is STACSAVE, type:
           A:\TECH\REPAIR /F C:\STACVOL.xxx <enter>
           or
           B:\TECH\REPAIR /F C:\STACVOL.xxx <enter>
           where the xxx is the file extention you determined in the
           step above.
       4.  If the latest saved header is STACSAVQ, type:
           A:\TECH\REPAIR /F C:\STACVOL.xxx /Q <enter>
           or
           B:\TECH\REPAIR /F C:\STACVOL.xxx /Q <enter>
           where the xxx is the file extention you determined in step 2
           above.
       5.  Remove all disks from the floppy drives and restart your
           computer.
