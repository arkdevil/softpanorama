                       RESTORING DAMAGED STACVOL FILES

      BACKGROUND
      
      This document addresses the error message Size Mismatch, Write
      Protected (on an existing Stacker drive), or the cases of an
      accidentaly deleted Stacvol file or an accidentally formatted
      host uncompressed drive. Each Stacker drive is actually a
      STACVOL.xxx file that is stored on the uncompressed drive. This
      file is given the hidden, read-only, and system attributes in
      order to protect it. If the File Allocation Table (FAT) on the
      uncompressed drive is damaged, or if the file is accidentaly
      deleted or the uncompressed drive is formatted, you may be able
      to recover some or all of the data using REPAIR.EXE. You should
      recognize that these are dangerous conditions, and that you may
      lose data.
      
      SOLUTION
      
          - Restore the STACVOL file using REPAIR.EXE
          - Restore the files necessary to mount the Stacker drive.
           
      Restore the STACVOL file using REPAIR.EXE
      
      These instructions assume that the STACVOL file on drive C is the
      one that is damaged. If the damaged file is on another drive,
      substitute that drive letter for C.
       1.  Do not write anything to the drive.
       2.  You may need to clear the system, hidden, and read-only
           attributes from the STACVOL file. Place your Stacker disk
           one in drive A or B, and type:
           A:\TOOLS\CSA C: <enter>
           (For this instruction and those following, if your Stacker
           disk goes in drive B, substitute B: for A:)
       3.  Type:
           DIR C:\STACVOL.* <enter>
           and record the exact spelling of the STACVOL file name. You
           will use this file name in the next step.
           
       4.  Type:
           A:\TECH\REPAIR /R C:\STACVOL.xxx  <enter>
       5.  Remove all diskettes from the floppy drives and restart the
           computer.
           
      Restore the files necessary to mount the Stacker drive.
      
      The procedures above may be sufficient to restore your Stacker
      Drive. You may also receive certain boot error messages if other
      necessary files were damaged along with the STACVOL file.
      
       1.  If the original problem was a formatted uncompressed drive,
           you may boot to a "Non-System Disk" error. If so, follow
           these steps. If not, proceed to step 2.
          a.  Restart your computer with your Stacker Startup Disk.
          b.  Type the following from the A prompt:
              SYS C: <enter>
          c.  Remove the Startup Disk from drive A and restart your
              computer.
       2.  If your Stacker drive is not mounted when you restart,
           examine the root directory of your C drive for a STACKER
           directory, a DOS directory, and a CONFIG.SYS file. If they
           do not exist, then type:
           MD STACKER <enter>
           MD DOS <enter>
           COPY CON CONFIG.SYS <enter>
           FILES=30 <enter>
           BUFFERS=20 <enter>
           Press the F6 key then <enter>
       3.  If you had to make a Stacker directory, place Stacker disk
           one in the A or B drive and type:
           COPY A:*.BIN C:\STACKER <enter>
           COPY A:STACKER.COM C:\STACKER <enter>
           If you are using DOS 5 or earlier also type:
           COPY A:SSWAP.COM C:\STACKER <enter>
       4.  If you had to make a DOS directory, place Stacker disk two
           in the A or B drive and type:
           COPY A:SATTRIB.EXE C:\DOS\ATTRIB.EXE <enter>
           Please note that this command copies the SATTRIB file to the
           DOS directory with a new name.
       5.  Place Stacker disk two in the A or B drive and type:
           A:CONFIG <enter>  then answer yes to the question asked.
       6.  If you have MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2, Novell DOS 7, and most
           releases of PC-DOS 6.1, then place Stacker disk one in the A
           or B drive and type:
           A:\TOOLS\REDBL C: <enter>
       7.  Remove all floppy disks from your drives and restart your
           computer.
