      STACKER NOTE                                         STACKER NOTE
                   STACKER 4.0 AND STACKER FOR OS/2 & DOS
        (Applies to Stacker 4.0 & Stacker for OS/2 & DOS 1.0 & 1.1)

      BACKGROUND
      
      Stacker 4.0 will not normally install over Stacker for OS/2 &
      DOS. The Setup program will look for the file STACKER.SYS in the
      \STACKER\OS2 subdirectory. If it is there, Setup will refuse to
      install Stacker 4.0. However, your computer may be configured in
      such a way that the STACKER.SYS file is not found. In this case,
      do not install Stacker 4.0 on a system that is using Stacker for
      OS/2 & DOS. If you do, you won't be able to see your compressed
      DOS drives under OS/2.  If you install Stacker 4.0 over Stacker
      for OS/2 & DOS, you may get a message booting into OS/2 "STACVOL
      file requires newer software version - Not Mounted".
      
      SOLUTION
      
          - Do not install Stacker 4.0 over Stacker for OS/2 & DOS, or
          - Remove Stacker for OS/2 & DOS before installing Stacker 4.0.
          - Uncompress any drives that are not mounted due to the
            installation of Stacker 4.0.
           
      Do not Install Stacker 4.0 over Stacker for OS/2 & DOS.
      
      Stacker for OS/2 & DOS does not yet take advantage of Stacker
      SmartPack. Therefore, Stacker for OS/2 & DOS cannot see a Stacker
      drive that is created by Stacker 4.0 which uses SmartPack.
      
      Remove Stacker for OS/2 & DOS before installing Stacker 4.0.
      
      If you want to install Stacker 4.0, you'll have to first remove
      Stacker for OS/2. First use the UNSTACK command to decompress
      your data. See the Stacker for OS/2 & DOS User's Guide for
      details on using the UNSTACK command. Then, remove the OS/2
      Stacker driver STACKER.SYS and its associated files from their
      directory (usually C:\STACKER\OS2). Then you can setup Stacker
      4.0. You will not be able to see your Stacker drives from OS/2
      after you setup Stacker 4.0.
      
      Uncompress any drives that are not mounted.
      
      If you have inadvertently installed Stacker 4.0 over Stacker for
      OS/2 & DOS you may receive the error message above. If so, you
      must uncompress the drive that is not mounting. Boot your
      computer into native DOS to mount the drive. Change to your
      Stacker directory and type STAC.  Choose UNCOMPRESS and follow
      the instructions on the screen.
