      STACKER NOTE                                         STACKER NOTE
                  USING DISK TECHNICIAN ON A STACKER DRIVE
                     (Applies to Stacker 2.x, 3.x, 4.x)
      STAC FAX  4402 (01-31-1994)

      BACKGROUND
      
      Disk Technician requires unused uncompressed space in order to
      run.  It needs approximately 2% of the drive you compressed with
      Stacker. For example, if you compress a 100 MB drive, Disk
      Technician needs approximately 2 MB of available uncompressed
      space.
      
      SOLUTION
      
          - Leave sufficient uncompressed space during Setup, or
          - Make sufficient uncompressed space available if your drive
            is already compressed.
           
      Leave sufficient uncompressed space available during Setup.
      
      When you "Compress an entire drive" using SETUP (INSTALL for
      Stacker version 2), you can specify an amount of space to keep 
      uncompressed.  This amount defaults to 1.0 MB if you
      compress the boot drive, and 100 K for all other hard disks.  Use
      the Advanced Options feature of SETUP to change this setting.
      
       1.  Run the Stacker SETUP. Choose the option "Custom Setup" when
           that screen is displayed.
       2.  Choose "Advanced Options" when you have that selection
           available. Tab to the section offering you the amount of
           space to leave uncompressed. Type in the amount of space you
           calculated that Disk Technician needs plus 1 MB if you are
           compressing your boot drive (100 KB for any other drive).
       3.  Continue the Stacker SETUP as usual.
           
      Make sufficient uncompressed space available.
      
      If you need to make more uncompressed space available after
      creating the Stacker drive, you can use the Stacker Toolbox to do
      this.
      
       1.  At the DOS prompt, type "STAC". Select "Change Drive Size".
           (For Stacker 2.x, choose "Grow and Shrink").
       
                                    Note
                 With Stacker 4.0 you may start this process
                   from Windows. Open the Stacker Toolbox,
                  select the drive you wish to change, and
                  click on the "configure" button. Click on
                 "OK" at the configure screen (change drive
                 size). Then click on "OK" to allow Stacker
                   to exit Windows. Continue following the
                              directions below.
       
       2.  At the next screen, select "More uncompressed space
           available".
       3.  Your dive will be defragmented. You will then be presented
           with a range that you may add to the present uncompressed
           space. Enter the amount of space you calculated that Disk
           technician needs.
