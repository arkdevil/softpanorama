Now I've Heard Everything Dept.: Why the network news doesn't jump on
stories like this shocks me. According to the international news service
Agence France-Presse, an Israeli man filed to get a divorce from his wife
because she was having an "affair" with an x-rated computer game. She was
dubbed by a Tel Aviv court a "theoretical adulteress" and the court
apparently decided to grant the man a divorce. Oh, brother.
