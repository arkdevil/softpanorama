LIMIT version 1.0

Data Compression Archive utility
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LIMIT is a fast and compact data compressor/archiver. The compression &
decompression routines have been written entirely in 80286 assembly, so it
runs faster than many other archivers. LIMIT also compresses better than
other archivers; it uses a compression method based on 32K sliding window
dictionary plus huffman encoding, similar to LHA/PKZIP/ARJ, but with some
improvments.

LIMIT is free! You may distribute freely, as long as the program is not
modified in any way. You are encouraged to contribute $20/- to the
programmer if you like this archiver.



1.  Files included in LIMIT 1.0
===============================

	LIMIT.EXE	the executable file
	LIMIT.DOC	LIMIT documentation


2.  System requirements
===============================

	80286 (PC/AT) and above
	Minimum conventional memory:
	  270k for updating/creating archives
	  170k for extracting/testing archives


3.  How to use LIMIT
===============================

Usage:
LIMIT command [options] archive[.LIM] [files] [@listfile] [#commentfile]

The special prefix '#'  specifies a comment file to be added/deleted to/from
archive. Prefix '@' species a list file to be included.

A list file is a text file consisting of file specfications separating by
space/tab/newline.


4.  Commands
===============================

	a[dd]		add files to archive, create one if necessary

	c[reate]	create new archive
			(delete previous archive of the	same name)

	del		delete files (or comment) in archive+

	e[xtract]	extract files in archive

	h[elp]		display help information

	i[nfo]		archive info
			shows summary of archive

	l[ist]		list specified files in archive

	rd		remove directories
			(directories must be empty.)

	t[est]		test files in archive by perform CRC checks



5.  options: (use - or / prefix)
===============================

	-x<files>	exclude files from the file list
			a list file may be specified: -x@listfile

			[commands: a,c,del,e,rd,t]

	-d<dir>		add/extract directory
			adding files: specifies the path to add files to
			extracting files: specifies the path to extract to

			[commands: a,c,e]

	-n		add/extract new files only

			[commands: a,c,e]

	-r		recurse sub-directories

			[commands: a,c]

	-s		recurse and store/extract partial paths
			files are added/extracted to their partial paths

			default: all files are added to root directory,
			and extracted to the current directory

			[commands: a,c,e]

	-p		store/extract full original paths
			files are added/extracted to their original paths

			default: all files are added to root directory,
			and extracted to the current directory

			[commands: a,c,e]

	-w[h|s]		include hidden or system files
			default: hidden/system files are not added to archive

			[commands: a,c]

	-es		extract to screen
			default: extract to file

			[command: e]

	-y		yes to all queries:
			1) del command: "delete all files?"
			2) e command: "overwrite file?"

	-m[0|1|s|x]	compression methods:
			-m0: store only
			-m1: normal compression  (default)
			-ms: fast compression
			-mx: maximum compression

			[commands: a,c]

6.  Examples
===============================

LIMIT a test *.c 	add all *.c files to test.lim archive

LIMIT a test /dabc	add all (default) files to directory "abc" in test.lim

LIMIT t test		test (using CRC checks) the archive test.lim

LIMIT l test *.asm	list all *.asm files in test.lim

LIMIT l test \abc\*	list all files in \abc directory in test.lim

LIMIT e test		extract all files in test.lim to current directory

LIMIT e test /n		extract all new files in test.lim to current directory

LIMIT e test /y		extract all files (overwrite, no query) to current dir

LIMIT e test *.c /dc:\	extract all *.c files to C:\

LIMIT del test *.h	delete all *.h files

LIMIT rd test \temp	remove \temp directory in archive test.lim

LIMIT i *		shows information of all archives in the current dir

LIMIT a -mx test	add all files to test.lim, with maximum compression

LIMIT a test /whs	add all files (including hidden & system) to test.lim

LIMIT a test \abc\*.* /r /p	add files, recurse sub-dirs and store full
				paths, i.e. include directory \abc
LIMIT a test \abc\*.* /s	add files, recurse sub-dirs and store new
				paths (excluding directory \abc)
LIMTI a test \abc\*.* /r	add files, recurse sub-dirs, store all files
				in root directory
LIMIT a test \abc\*.* /p	add files, store full paths

LIMTI e test /p			extract all files and subdirectories into
				original paths

7.  Setting the environment string LIMIT
========================================
Options that are included in the environment string LIMIT are automatically
included whenver LIMIT is run. To set the environment string, type

> set LIMIT = /mx /n

This tells LIMIT to use maximum compression and add/extract newer files only.
However, options specified in the command line override those options in
the LIMIT environment string.


8.  Compression method
===============================
LIMIT employs a LHA/PKZIP/ARJ-similar kind of sliding dictionary plus huffman
encoding, with some minor enhancements.

A compression index controls the extent to which strings are searched in the
dictionary. The index for each compression option is as follows:

	/ms (fastest) compression: 30
	/m1 (default) compression: 300
	/mx (maximum) compression: 3000

However, there are files where a smaller index yields better compression.
You may fine-tune the compression by controlling the index, using option
/c<index>.
	e.g. LIMIT a /c1000 archive *.*


9.  Bugs/Comments
===============================
No program is free of bugs, so report any bugs or comments or suggestions to
the programmer.


10. Contributions, please!
===============================
LIMIT is the product of thousands of programming hours. If you like this
program, please contribute some money ($20 would be great!) to the programmer
as a token of encouragement.
