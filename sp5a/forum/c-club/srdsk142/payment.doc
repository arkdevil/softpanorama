PRIVATE USERS

        Individual users using SRDISK 1.42 on their privately owned
        computers for noncommercial purposes may use it free of charge.


SITE LICENSES

        Business and corporate users are licensed to evaluate SRDISK for
        one month free of charge. After that they are required to buy a
        license for their use of SRDISK.

        The cost of SRDISK for business and corporate users depends on
        the number of computers they license SRDISK for. A minimum
        payment of US$24, equal to two licenses, is required.

        These prices are valid to the end of year 1992; I will propably
        raise them when the version 2.0 is out and proved reliable. Note
        that you can get a discount by registering now.

          Computers     Price
              2-10      US$12 (FIM 50) per computer
             11-50      US$6 (FIM 25) per computer
             51-200     US$5 (FIM 20) per computer
            201-1000    US$3 (FIM 15) per computer
           1001-        US$2 (FIM 10) per computer (or mail me to ask)

        Read the table so, that the license for 10 first computers will
        cost $12 each. 40 computers after that $6 each etc. For example
        the payment for 100 computers will be

                 10 computers at $12 is $120
                 40 computers at  $6 is $240
                 50 computers at  $5 is $250
                ====================================
                                  total $610

        If you are licensing for about 50 computers or more, I am well
        satisfied if you give an estimate of the number of computers you
        are going to run it on. Please, round it to nearest ten
        computers or so - I do not mind a 10% margin of error in the
        count of computers.


Coverage of license

        The license will cover all versions 1.x and 2.x of SRDISK.
        Depending on what the version 3.x will hold, it may or may not
        be included in the license (will be noted in the version 3.x
        documentation). If it is not included, I will continue to
        support the 2.x versions that are covered by the license for
        possible bug fixes for as long as someone reports bugs in it.

        The license is non-transferable. It may not be given, sold or
        rented forward.


Update service

        Updates will be made available on some anonymous FTP sites
        (Simtel, garbo.uwasa.fi), from where they hopefully will spread
        around. Updated versions will be made available as need araises.
        I estimate there will be about three releases per year and
        possibly some bug fixes.

        If update service is wanted, you can add US$20 for each update
        disk you want me to send you and mail with the registration form
        your instructions about how many updates and at what intervals
        (in months and/or releases) you want them. Also the full address
        you want the update disks to be sent to should be included in
        the instructions.

        If you do not wish to pay beforehand, you can mail me the US$20
        when you want the update disk. In this case, tell what is the
        latest version you have. If you have the latest version, I'll
        hold your money untill the next version is ready or if you wish,
        send you the money back/not chash it. Include the registration
        form with the appropriate fields filled.

        The version I'll be sending is no newer than one month. This
        is to guarantee that the version is well tested and no serious
        bugs are in the release.

        The update service is available for registered users only.

        By accepting your payment, I place myself under the obligation
        to provide you with the updates or pay the money back.

        If you want a custom-made update service, please contact me.
