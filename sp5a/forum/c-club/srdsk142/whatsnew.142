- /W did not work correctly when formatted at the same time.

- BIOS Parameter Block no longer reports extra sectors that did not fit
into any cluster.

- Restricted FAT copies to maximum of 2. DOS 5 CHKDSK did not allow
more, so now SRDISK doesn't either.

- /E switch fixed to give sensible variable names even after 9 SRDISK
drives. Variables after SRDISK9 are SRDISKA, SRDISKB etc.

- SRDISK.SYS caused the block devices loaded after it to have bad drive
letters assigned to them.

- Tried to read root directory when there was no disk.

- MS-DOS 5 does not interpret the disk size correctly after the sector
size had been made larger. Deviced a get-around for the bug.

- Memory allocation has been changed to help the memory managers.

1.41 06-06-1992

- I started to take a licensing fee from corporate users. Sorry, I have
no other income currently. I tried to make the prices reasonable, but if
you feel the prices are too high for your casual use, you can try to
bargain.

- One '!' had disappeared from the env.c causing the /E not to work.
Hopefully not many copies of the 1.40 version got out.

1.40 03-06-1992

- DR-DOS 6 hangup solved by passing a valid looking BIOS Parameter Block
  at init.

- Added a check for DR-DOS 5, since SRDISK did not seem to work with it
  unless sector size was 128 bytes. Under DR-DOS 5 sector size now
  forced to 128 bytes.

- resolve_drive() now finds drive letters even if driver loaded high
  with some upper memory manager utility. Also if driver not found,
  disks should be configurable anyway as 1:, 2:, etc. - although better
  would be to tell the drive letter in CONFIG.SYS.

- Disk size 1 with /F:1 to get rid of drive not ready reports.

- Unless forced sector/cluster/root dir sizes, adjust them properly.

- Have srdisk handle allocation of known types of memory. Also enhanced
  allocation to hopefully work better with DesqView.

- Reorganized source to several files. Also many other minor changes and
  source beautifying.

- Multiplex interrupt interface changed a bit.

- Borland C++ 3.0 produced bad code handling long integers and thus the
  beginning of FAT was a little wrong. Changed the code to one not
  having a bug.



1.30 18-01-1992

- Changed to freeware from public domain

- Changed the driver control from IOCTL calls to multiplex interrupt.

- Added support for over 32M RAM drives (up to 4096M). Over 32M drives
  need DOS 4+ because they use over 0xFFFF sectors.

- Added /V switch for program verbosity control. /Y now only forces the
  disk format, it does not make the program less verbose.

- Support for chained drivers. These drivers all contribute memory for
  the same virtual drive. Added switch /M to control how much memory may
  be used by each driver in the chain.

- Formatting reads the root directory to find out if there is anything
  that would be destroyed. If not, it will not ask for permission to
  destroy.

- Added /E switch to set environment variables SRDISKn to show srdisk
  drives.

- Scans Drive Parameter Table on DOS 2 and 3 to find the drive letters,
  if necessary.



1.20 04-10-1991

- Fixed name of program by adding the missing 'Re' to 'Sizeable'.

- Added 16 bit FAT support; more 'sizeable' disks that had over 4077
  clusters were not operational. Due to DOS's inconsistent behaviour,
  disks with over 4077 and under 4088 clusters (or over 65518, possible
  with 128 byte clusters and 8M disk size) are avoided by making
  clusters bigger.

- Added DOS lookalike disk formats via switch /F.

- The FAT number is now defined via switch /A instead of /F.

- The time of format is stored in volume label.

- Upgraded to IOCTL_msg version 1.20 which tells the type of memory used
  by the driver.

- Disallow sectors greater than 512 bytes as DOS can not handle them
  properly but rather crashes when it encounters them.

- Allow clusters up to 8 kilobytes.

- Enhanced help.



1.10 06-09-91

- Added full support for multiple FATs. 1.00 had the /F switch, but no
  support for it in formatter.

- Updated to IOCTL_msg versio 1.10 so that media byte is no longer used
  to indicate the media change but to indicate the drive is RAM disk.

- Some minor fixes.



1.00 09-06-91 Initial release
