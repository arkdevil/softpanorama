1. What is Win-eXpose-I/O

 Win-eXpose-I/O is a file I/O Tracing/Debugging SHAREWARE windows util. that
 lets you examine in real time what files each running application is using
 or trying to use.
 Win-eXpose-I/O traces all the file activities in all the application and in
 all the different VM (even DOS boxes) and gives you a clear picture on
 problems troubleshooting (like where and what the hell is the help file / INI
 file that the application is using or complaining that is missing).

 Win-eXpose-I/O is a MUST HAVE tool for anyone who is installing windows
 software on the computer or just trying to make sure the current software
 is working properly, Win-eXpose-I/O saves those HUGE amount of hours trying to
 configure new or existing software by letting you know in real time what files
 each application is using or seeking.

 Win-eXpose-I/O application has a very intuitive and simple to operate user
 interface, yet a very powerful one that lets any user novice to guru
 use the program in just a meter of seconds, just run it and then activate
 the other applications and you will see on the Win-eXpose-I/O screen a
 real-time logging of all the file activities and their results.

 Win-eXpose-I/O is also used as a GREAT performance improves by letting you
 know for each application all the file seeking failures (like searching
 for a file on the path) and then just by changing a few system settings
 like PATH or working directory you will gain a performance improvement.

 4. INSTALLATION

 Requirements: Windows 3.1 / Windows for Workgroups, 80386 Processor or better 

  To perform the installation copy the distributed file into a new directory
  and run from Windows the INSTALL program from that directory.

  Just to let you know ...
  The installation will create a group item named "Win-eXpose-I/O" and an
  icon to run the application.
  The file system.ini will also be modified and a line :

      	device=WinExpos.386

  will be inserted under the [386Enh] section.
  

 5. IMPORTANT NOTES  

  o . If you are working in Windows For Workgroups and no I/O operations are
      being logged on the Win-eXpose trace screen, you have to turn off
      the "32bit file access option " there are two diffrent ways to do it :
	1. Go to the windows for workgroups control panel, click on the
	   386 enhanced icon, then on the <virtual memory> button ,and then
	   on the <change> button and then uncheck the
	   "use 32-bit file access" option nad then click on the <ok> button.
	2. Start windows by typing insteded of WIN the command :
			WIN /D:C

  o . If you have any problem what so ever with accessing the trace files
      	or activating the program, you may want to try the following steps:

		1. Delete the file WinExpIO.ini from the windows directory.
		2. Remove any *.wxi files in the installation directory.
		3. Check that there is a line in the system.ini file
			in the windows directory that loads the WinExpos.386
			windows device driver.
		4. Check that the original product *.doc and *.txt are in
			the Win-eXpose-I/O installation directory.
		5. If you are hear some sounds being played while activating
			the problem, do be scarred, the sound is being played
			every time there are 100 new failed I/O operations
			on the machine, the sound playing is removed in the
			registered version.
		6. Check that you didn't run out of disk space.
		7. As a last resort, try to re-install the product.

  o . Due to windows 3.1 limitations the list box that contains the list of
      	I/O traces is limit for about 2000 lines, that means that you can see
	only the first 2000 I/O operations from the time a new trace file is
	opened, still in the operation dialog you can see ALL the I/O
	operations by clicking on the F7, F8 keys or on the <- , -> bottons.
	If you see that you reach the limit of 2000 you can always open
	a new trace file with another name and then the previos information
	will be kept a side.


6. Why and how to Register ?

 In order to register complete the registration form (ORDER.TXT) as
 completely as possible and send it with the 29 US dollars registration fee
 to :

	Israel

 Payment can be in Cash, money order & checks, Payments in checks must be
 in US dollars drawn on a US bank or Israeli shekels drawn on a Israeli bank,
 CASH payment can be in ANY currency whatsoever.
 Please try to pay in cash for small orders, if you are paying with checks
 most of the money goes to the bank it self due to the bank commissions.

 In return you will get a Serial number and a password that you should
 enter after running the program and choosing the Register option from the
 Help menu.

 Registering brings with it a number of advantages.

 o All the Unregistered Copy notice will no longer appear.

 o You will receive a menual.

 o Next major version is sent automatically when it becomes available.

 o If you supplied an E-Mail account a notice for each version release will
   be sent to you.

 o You will have FREE technical support should you have any problems.

 o The sound that is being played every new 100 I/O operation that failed
   will be removed.

 o Your support will encourage me to continue to improve Win-eXpose-I/O.

 o You will have the knowledge that you personally helped a fledgling
   software developer and furthered the SHAREWARE concept.

 o As I see it, by using this Win-eXpose-I/O software you are saving yourself
   a lot of trail and error hours trying to solve problems or just
   understand what is going wrong ( and on ) so this small registration
   fee is really a small one to pay comparing to the benefits that
   Win-eXpose-I/O brings you.

 And Finally, as a registered user you will be automatically become a register
 user for ALL the new Win-eXpose-I/O versions without paying any more fees.
 So make sure you complete the registration form (ORDER.TXT) as
 completely as possible and send it back with the registration fees.

 Thank you and enjoy it,
