Have you ever used the Internet or CompuServe?  If so, you've
probably encountered ZIP files.  Are you a Windows user?  If so,
WinZip is THE way to handle these archived files.

WinZip brings the convenience of Windows to the use of ZIP files
without requiring PKZIP and PKUNZIP.  It features an intuitive
point-and-click drag-and-drop interface for viewing, running,
extracting, adding, deleting, and testing files in archives.  ARJ,
LZH, and ARC files are supported via external programs.  WinZip
interfaces to most virus scanners.

New in WinZip 5.6 is built-in support for popular Internet file
formats:  TAR, gzip, and Unix compress.  Now you can use WinZip to
access almost all the files you download from Internet.

Here's what the magazine reviews say about WinZip:

   Edition, Winter 1995

   program", Windows Sources 7/94
"Must Buy" rating, PC Laptop, 7/94

WinZip is extremely easy to use!  To open an archive simply double
click on an archive listed in the File Manager, drag and drop an
archive onto WinZip, or use the standard Open dialog.  The main
WinZip window features a list box with the names, sizes, and
date/time stamps of all files in the open archive.  This list can
be scrolled and sorted on any field.  A tool bar provides fast
access to commonly used actions.  All options (including window
size and position) can be saved and restored.  Extensive context
sensitive help is always available.

Double clicking on a file in the main window has the same effect
as double clicking in the File Manager.  First the file is
extracted from the archive.  If the file is executable, it is run.
Otherwise, the file is opened by the appropriate application (for
example, Windows Write for *.WRI files) based on standard Windows
associations.

The Windows 3.1 Drag and Drop Interface is fully supported.  You
can drag and drop files from WinZip to other applications.  WinZip
will extract the files before dropping them on the target
application.  The target application will treat the files as if
they had been dropped by the File Manager.  You can also drop
archives on WinZip to open them, or drop files on WinZip to add
them to the open archive.

WinZip's unique "Install/Uninstall Feature" makes it easy to
install and uninstall software distributed in archives.  This
feature can save megabytes of disk space by tracking and removing
all traces of an application.  WinZip will run the installation
program in an archive, give you a chance to try the program, and
optionally offer to restore your system to its original state.
The uninstall step can selectively remove directories, files,
icons, or program groups created by an install program, and can
restore any altered INI files.  You have complete control over the
uninstall process, and no changes are made without approval.

If an archive doesn't have an "install" or "setup" program you can
use the CheckOut facility to easily try the files in the archive.
The CheckOut facility will extract all files and create a program
group with icons for all or some files.  Just double click on an
icon in the CheckOut group to view the corresponding file with the
appropriate application.  WinZip will optionally delete the
CheckOut files and program group.

WinZip requires Windows 3.1 or later.  While no other programs are
required for basic operations involving ZIP files, optional
features require one or more external programs, including PKZIP
and PKUNZIP product from PKWARE, Inc, LHA.EXE from Haruyasu
Yoshizaki, or the Shareware ARJ product from Robert Jung.  WinZip
interfaces to several programs to access ARC files and optionally
runs most virus scanning utilities.  See the online help for
details.

WinZip is distributed as Shareware.  This means that users are
encouraged, subject to restrictions described in the License
Agreement, to share copies of this program with friends,
associates and bulletin boards.  Please remember that if you use
this software you are required to pay the registration fee of $29
as described in the License Agreement (LICENSE.TXT).

This program is produced by a member of the Association of
Shareware Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure that the
shareware principle works for you.  If you are unable to resolve a
shareware-related problem with an ASP member by contacting the
member directly, ASP may be able to help.  The ASP Ombudsman can
help you resolve a dispute or problem with an ASP member, but does
not provide technical support for members' products.  Please write
to the ASP Ombudsman at 545 Grover Road, Muskegon, MI 49442 or
send a CompuServe message to the ASP Ombudsman at 70007,3536.
