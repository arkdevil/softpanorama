		     Copyright 1994, 1995 by McAfee, Inc.
			     All Rights Reserved.



These release notes cover what is new in VirusScan 2.2.6 and the
August DAT release (9509) of VirusScan for DOS, VirusScan for
Windows, VirusScan for OS/2 and VShield.

     !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
     ! NOTE: OS/2 users.  IF YOUR OS/2 SYSTEM IS CONNECTED TO OS/2  ! 
     ! LANMANAGER, DO NOT RUN OS/2 SCAN FROM STARTUP.CMD.  DOING SO ! 
     ! COULD RESULT IN LOST DESKTOP OR OTHER UNDESIRABLE RESULTS.   ! 
     !                                                              !
     ! McAfee is working with IBM and with several large            !
     ! organizations, which rely heavily on OS/2, to alleviate the  !
     ! corruption problem.                                          !
     !                                                              !
     ! The temporary solution is to put VirusScan in a start up     !
     ! group.  Not in the log in script or in the start up command  !
     ! file.                                                        !
     !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Note for NT users:
   You must add the following line in your DEFAULT.CFG and PROFILE1.PRF
   file (or any other profile you have chosen to use), residing in the
   same directory as WSCAN.EXE.

	/NODDA

   If you are not familiar with profiles, please refer to VIRUSCAN.TXT
   or your printed manual.

-----------------------------------------------------
2.2.6 New Functionality:

The new VSHIELD.EXE is required for VSHIELD to make use of these new
detection strings (DAT files).

/ALL
   Now understands the data format of a Microsoft Word (tm) document
   file format in order to search for the new breed of Word Macro
   viruses.  For example:

   SCAN C: /ALL /REPORT scan.rpt

Winword.Concept (alias Prank Macro, WordMacro.Concept, WW6Macro)

The new virus, Winword.Concept, representing a new class of viruses,
has been discovered!  This virus is a Macro virus.  It infects the
Word environment on any hardware platform (PC Compatible, Mac, PowerPC,
etc.) and its .DOC and .DOT files.

Winword.Concept is a benign virus.  Your only symptom if you have this
virus is a one time occurance of a dialog box with only "1" as text and
only "OK" as a choice.  Following that, it replicates a set of macros
into your global template file (usually NORMAL.DOT) and changes any
file saved using the "Save As..." command to be of the template type.

VirusScan 2.2.6 can be used to scan your .DOC and .DOT files.  You must
use the /ALL switch as described above.

If you discover that you have this virus, please enter into Word and read
the .DOC file included in this package.  Follow the instructions and apply
them to every .DOC or .DOT file which VirusScan detects as being infected
with the WinWord.Concept virus.

If you determine that you are not infected, please take this opportunity
to protect yourself from this form of viruses.	In Word, go to:

	Tools
	Options...
	Save

and enable the "Prompt to Save Normal.dot" option.  This will alert you
to any future attempt by any macro viruses to infect your system.

WordMacro.DMV

This one was published shortly after the outbreak of WinWord.Concept.
It is not as widespread as WinWord.Concept.

(*) Effective 9508, we adopted the CARO name of Byway.	To remove
this virus, boot up with the virus in memory.  Copy all executable
files to floppy, with a non-executable extension.  Copy all the data
files off.  Format harddisk.  Replace files.

(**) To remove Da'Boys from a hard disk infection, one needs to
boot from a clean corresponding DOS version and execute the
command "SYS C:".
