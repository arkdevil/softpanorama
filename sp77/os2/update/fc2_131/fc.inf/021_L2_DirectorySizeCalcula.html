<P>
 If you want to get an idea of what's taking up your precious disk space
it's often useful to calculate how much space is used by a particular directory
and all its sub-directories. File Commander/2 allows you to do this for
one or more of the directories showing in a file panel.
<P>
 To calculate the size of a directory, move the highlght on to the directory
you wish to know the size of and press<B> Ctrl-Q</B>. This may take some
time if there are a large number of files or sub-directories in the directory
being calculated. When the directory has been scanned its total size is
displayed in the same field as where a file's size is displayed instead
of the word<B> SUBDIR</B>.
<P>
 If you want sereral of the directories in the panel to be calculated, tag
them before pressing<B> Ctrl-Q</B> and all will be calculated. Calculating
all of the directories provides a useful breakdown of where your disk space
is being used.
<P>
 If you decide that the calculation is taking too long you can cancel it
at any time by pressing ESC.
