<UL>If you use 4os2 as your command interpreter, try
to keep the contents of your 4start.cmd to a minimum as it is run every
time you execute an external command in FC/2. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>The
fastest way to select a new drive for a panel using the mouse is to click
the right mouse button on F1/F2 in the help bar at the bottom of the screen.

</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>FC/2's tree information
is kept up to date if you create and delete directories using FC/2. The
only exception to this is if a directory tree is copied or moved between
drives. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>If you attach 4DOS/4OS2
descriptions to your files, they will be preserved if you copy or move them
using FC/2. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>If you want
your viewer or editor to run in a separate session (or want FC/2 to be able
to operate while using a DOS viewer / editor) add the 'start' keyword before
the name of your viewer / editor. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>If
you don't get the blue FC/2 icon when you install FC/2 onto your desktop,
you've probably lost the EAs attached to fc.exe. Use InfoZip's unzip when
unzipping the FC/2 distribution. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>People
who really don't like the 3D shadow effect can turn it off by editing fc.ini
so that it contains a line: shadows=off
