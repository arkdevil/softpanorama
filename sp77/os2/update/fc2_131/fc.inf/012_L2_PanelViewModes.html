 The panels can display a list of files in several different ways. To change
the style of view, select it via the <A HREF="027_L1_Menu.html">Menu</A> (Left
or Right, depending on which panel you wish to change). You have the choice
of:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Brief</B><!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL> Displays three columns of file names
with no details. The status line at the bottom of the panel displays the
details as in Full view for the current file. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Full
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL>Displays file names with their size and the
date and time of last modification. The status line is devoted entirely
to displaying as much of the file name as possible allowing you to see more
of a long file name than in the main section of the panel. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Wide
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL>Displays file names with their size, providing
much more space for the file name. This mode is most useful when viewing
HPFS directories with many long file names. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Tree
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL>Views the overall directory structure of the
current drive of the<I> opposite</I> panel. Unlike in the above modes, when
a panel is in tree mode, it is linked to the opposite panel in that selecting
a directory on the tree and pressing ENTER causes the opposite panel to
view that directory. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Info</B><!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL> The
Info panel displays drive summary information for the current drive of the
<I>opposite</I> panel. Details listed include total space, free space, label,
file system and serial number. You can quickly activate an Info panel using
Ctrl-L.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
