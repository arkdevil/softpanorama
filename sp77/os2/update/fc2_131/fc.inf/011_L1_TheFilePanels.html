<P>
 The file panels are central to most operations in FC/2. They allow you
to browse through the files on your drives, copy, move, rename and delete
files you select from them as well as view, edit or execute any file.
<P>
 Normally, one panel will be active and the other will be inactive. The
active panel is indicated by having its title highlighted. To change the
active panel, press the TAB key or click the mouse on the panel you wish
to become active.
<P>
 At any time, either or both panels can be hidden, allowing you to view
the screen behind which will contain the output of any programs you've run.
Press Ctrl-O to hide / re-display all visible panels or Ctrl-F1/F2 to switch
the Left/Right panel on or off.
<P>
 If you feel that the information in a panel is no longer up to date, you
can press Ctrl-R to re-read the information displayed in the panel. Note
that this may take some time for Tree view panels if you have a large number
of directories on your drive.
