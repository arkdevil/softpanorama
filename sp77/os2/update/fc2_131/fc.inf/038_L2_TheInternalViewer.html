  The file viewer built into FC/2 is a basic text viewer that is perfect
for taking a quick look at your text files. You can use the mouse or keyboard
to scroll the text up and down (Keys: Cursor-Up/Down, Page Up/Down, Home,
End).
<P>
 To scroll the text using the mouse, click the mouse in the top or bottom
thirds of the screen. Using the right mouse button pages up or down. When
the mouse is being used to scroll the text, the speed of scrolling is determined
by the 'scrolldelay' <A HREF="034_L3_Configuration.html">Configuration</A> directive.

<P>
 If a line is longer than 80 columns it will be chopped off at that length
and the remainder placed one the next line unless you use F2 to select Unwrap
mode. With the text unwrapped, you can use the Left / Right arrows to scroll
the text horizontally. Ctrl-Left/Right scrolls in a much larger step (40
columns). Also, the mouse can be used to scroll horizontally by clicking
the mouse in the centre third of the screen on the left or right side. ie
