 To make directory navigation easier, you can store the current directory
path in one of ten 'slots'. At a later point in time you may recall the
directory which causes the current panel to instantly move to the stored
directory. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>To store the current directory, hold down Ctrl and
Shift then press one of keys 0-9 on the numeric keypad. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

<P>
 If you forget which directories you've assigned to which keys, you can
view the contents of the slots using Alt-F5. This lists all ten stored paths
from which you can select one to change to using the Up / Down arrow keys
and ENTER, clicking on one with the mouse or pressing a number from 0-9.

<P>
 If you do a 'Save Setup' before exiting FC/2, the directories you've stored
will be remembered the next time you start it up.
