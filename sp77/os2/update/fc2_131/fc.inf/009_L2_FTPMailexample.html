<P>
 You can use an ftpmail server to retrieve FC/2 (or any other file on an
ftp archive site) as an electronic mail message. Mail the following message
to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com and you should receive in reply a series of mail
messages that contain FC/2 in <A HREF="055_L0_.html">uuencoded</A> form.
To extract the ZIP file you need to remove the headers and footers from
the mail messages, join them together and run a uudecode program on the
resulting file.  reply &lt;your email address&gt;
<BR>
connect ftp.cdrom.com

uuencode

chdir pub/os2/32bit/diskutil
<BR>
get fc2_131.zip
<BR>
quit

<P>
 Change the file name in the 'get' command to the name of the latest version.
If you do not know what that is, you can change the 'get' command to a 'dir'
command and you will be sent a list of the files available.
