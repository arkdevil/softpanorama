<P>
 The Change Directory Tree can be used to quickly locate and display the
directory you're looking for. To activate it, press Alt-F10 or select it
from the <A HREF="032_L2_CommandsMenu.html">Commands Menu</A>. You can then
either browse through the tree structure using the same keys as used to
browse through a file panel, or you can start typing the name of the directory
you are looking for.
<P>
 As you type, the view will jump to the first directory name matching what
you have typed so far. You can either keep typing until the directory you're
looking for is located or you can use Ctrl-Enter to find the next match
of what you've typed.
<P>
 When you've found the directory you want, press ENTER to make it the current
directory of the current panel. You can exit the Change Directory Tree at
any time by pressing ESC.
<P>
 If you have not previously viewed the tree of the current drive it must
be read and this may take some time on a large drive. Once it has been read,
the tree structure for the drive is saved to a file for future reference.
Normally this file (fc2tree.dat) is written to the root directory of the
drive the file describes. If you don't like this or if it's not possible
(eg CD-ROM drives) you can make FC/2 store all tree data files in one directory
of your choice. To do this, change the<B> treedir</B> setting in Options/Configuration
to specify the directory where you want the data files.
<P>
 If at any time you believe the tree being shown is not correct, you can
re-read the tree structure by pressing Ctrl-R.
