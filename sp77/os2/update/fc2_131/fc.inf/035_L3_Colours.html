 You will be presented with a list of items in the colour scheme. Use the
four arrow keys to move to the item you wish to change and then use F to
cycle through forground colours and B to cycle through background colours.
Holding SHIFT at the same time will cycle backwards. There are a total of
16 foreground and 8 background colours to choose from.
<P>
 When you're done, press Enter to use the changes you've made or ESC to
forget them. Note that the changes will only be remembered for next time
if you use 'Save Setup' or have Autosave enabled.
