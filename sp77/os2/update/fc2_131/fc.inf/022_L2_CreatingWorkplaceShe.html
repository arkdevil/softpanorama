<P>
 File Commander/2 provides a quick and easy way to create Workplace Shell
Objects that is much easier than opening up your templates folder, dragging
an object out and filling in all the details for it. All you have to do
is locate the file you want an object for and press Alt-F6. There is a simple
confirmation dialog to make sure you mean what you've pressed.
<P>
 If the file is an executable (.exe .com .bat .cmd) a Program object is
created. For all other file types (including directories) a shadow object
is created the same as if you had created a shadow of the file from the
Drives object.
<P>
 Note that if you have tagged any files, objects will be created for all
tagged files. All objects are created on the desktop ready for you to drop
them into whichever folder you want them in.
