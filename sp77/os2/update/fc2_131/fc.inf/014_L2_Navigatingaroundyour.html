 When moving to a particular directory, the first step is get the correct
drive showing. Press Alt-F1 for the left panel or Alt-F2 for the right panel
to display a simple dialog box showing the currently available drives. Select
the drive you want by pressing the appropriate letter, using the left /
right arrows to move the highligt and press ENTER or clicking on the letter
with the mouse. You can also change drives by entering a command in the
form "d:" on the command line.
<P>
 Once you have the right drive, you can move around your directories by
moving the cursor to a directory you want to change into and pressing ENTER.
Selecting ".." moves to the parent of the current directory. Moving the
cursor around the list of files in the current directory is achieved using
the Up / Down arrows, Page Up, Page Down, Home and End. Double clicking
the mouse on a directory name has will also change into that directory.
The full path of the current directory is always shown on the top line of
the panel.
