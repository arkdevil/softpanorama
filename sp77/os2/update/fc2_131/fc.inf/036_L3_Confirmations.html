<P>
 Before doing anything significantly destructive, FC/2 will ask for confirmation
from the user to prevent accidental loss of data. If you are confident in
your use of FC/2 and don't want to be asked for confirmation all the time,
you can disable some of the more common confirmation prompts by selecting
'Confirmations' from the Options <A HREF="027_L1_Menu.html">Menu</A>.
<P>
 A dialog displaying a list of confirmation types is then displayed with
a check box next to each one. An 'X' in a check box indicates that the confirmation
is<I> enabled</I>. To disable a confirmation, click its check box with the
mouse and click OK. The keyboard can also be used (Up / Down arrows and
Space, Enter when done).
<P>
The confirmations you can alter are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Delete File/Empty Directory</B><!-- lm: 0x12 40 -->
<UL> The first prompt
you see after pressing F8. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Delete Tagged Files
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 40 -->
<UL>The second prompt you see after pressing F8
when there are files tagged. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
