<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 4 -->A cheque made out in your local currency for
the equivalent of $35 Australian (It costs me to cash foreign currency cheques

<P>
 Send payments to the address given in <A HREF="043_L1_ContactingtheAuthor.html">Contacting
the Author</A>. Please make cheques payable to 'Brian Havard' (and please
spell it correctly when writing the cheque to keep my bank manager happy).

<P>
 Please include a <A HREF="004_L2_RegistrationForm.html">Registration form
</A>(or note containing same information).
<P>
 Once you have registered, you will be sent a serial number that, with your
name, will allow you to 'register' the copy of the program you have. Once
you have done this your name will appear in the 'Info' panel and you will
not see any shareware reminders. This serial number will be good for all
future versions of FC/2 so<B> you'll only ever have to pay once.</B>
<P>
 If you have an email address (Internet or Compuserve), include it on the
registration form for fastest response. The next best alternative is a fax
number.
