<P>
 These three operations are all performed in a similar way. All can be performed
on either a single file or a group of files. To operate on a single file,
simply move the highlight bar to the file you want to copy/move/delete using
the keys described in <A HREF="013_L2_MovingAroundtheCurre.html">Moving
Around the Current Directory</A> and press F5 to copy, F6 to move and F8
to delete. These keys (along with the rest of the function keys) are listed
at the bottom of the screen so you don't have to memorize them.
<P>
 If you want to operate on a number of files at once, you should<I> tag
</I>the files you wish to be affected (See <A HREF="019_L2_TaggingFiles.html">Tagging</A>)

<P>
 If you select copy or move, you will next be presented with a dialog box
that allows you to specify the destination directory and file name. The
default destination is the directory showing in the opposite panel. If this
is what you want, just press ENTER to proceed, otherwise use the arrow keys,
Delete, Backspace etc., to alter the path to what you want. You can also
change the file name if you wish.
<P>
 You can rename several files at once using wild card characters '*' and
'?'. For example, to change the extension of several files to .bak you would
specify the destination file as '*.bak'. The wildcard characters represent
characters taken from the source file name.
<P>
 If you select delete, you will be prompted with a confirmation dialog.
If you're sure you want to go ahead with the delete, press Enter, 'y' or
click 'OK'. To back out, press ESC, 'n' or click 'Cancel'. If there are
files tagged you will be warned and asked a second time to confirm the delete.
This is to make sure you haven't forgotten that some files are tagged which
can happen if the tagged files have been scrolled off the panel. Either
or both of these confirmations can be disabled if you wish (See <A HREF="036_L3_Confirmations.html">Confirmations</A>).

<P>
 All of the above operations can be stopped mid-process by pressing<B> ESC</B>.
