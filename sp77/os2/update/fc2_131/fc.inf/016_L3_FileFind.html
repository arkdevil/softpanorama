<P>
 The File Find function can be used to search for a particular file. To
activate it, press Alt-F7 or select it from the <A HREF="032_L2_CommandsMenu.html">Commands
Menu</A>.
<P>
 There are three controls on the File Find dialog that you can use to narrow
the search. These are: <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>File(s) to Find</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL> The name of the file you're
looking for. The name can contain any of the wildcard characters described
in <A HREF="019_L2_TaggingFiles.html">Tagging</A>. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Containing
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL>A text string that a file must contain in order
to be considered a match. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Start at Root</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL> If
this option is checked (default) the file search will search the entire
current drive. If not, only the current directory and its subdirectories
will be searched.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
<P>
 Press ENTER to begin the search. As matches are found, they are listed
with their full path in the File Find window. You can stop the search at
any time by pressing ESC. You can do this to save time if the file you're
looking for has been located but much of the drive has yet to be searched.

<P>
 Once the search is over, the list of matches is displayed from which you
can choose one using the Up / Down arrows, Page Up/Down, Home/End or clicking
with the mouse. Pressing ENTER or double clicking the mouse on a file name
will return to the file panel with its current directory changed to that
of the selected file and with the selected file highlighted.
<P>
 You can also view or edit a file from the list using F3 or F4 respectively.
If you used the<B> Containing</B> field and you use FC/2's internal viewer
or editor, the starting position will be that of the first match.
<P>
 If you do not want to see any of the files found you can press ESC to exit
File Find (or click Cancel) or press 'n' (or click New) to start another
search.
<P>
 Whichever way you exit the File Find dialog, you can recall the list of
files found by the last search by pressing Shift-Alt-F7. This can be very
handy if you wish to examine each matched file in turn.
