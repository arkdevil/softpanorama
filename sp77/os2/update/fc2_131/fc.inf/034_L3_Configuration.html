<P>
 To view the configuration options, select 'Configuration' from the Options
<A HREF="027_L1_Menu.html">Menu</A>. Any options you change take effect
as soon as you click OK (or move the highlight to OK and press Enter). If
you use Cancel, all changes you've made are forgotten.
<P>
 To select an option to change either click on it with the mouse or use
the Up / Down arrow keys to move to it. The current option is denoted by
a '()'. To alter non-string options, use the space bar to toggle the value.

<P>
 Moving up from the first option or down from the last option will highlight
one of the buttons at the bottom of the dialog. You can then use the Left
/ Right arrows to move the highlight onto the button you want and Enter
to activate it. It's usually easier to use the mouse.
<P>
 If you want the changes to still be in effect the next time you start FC/2
you need to select 'Save Setup' from the Options <A HREF="027_L1_Menu.html">Menu
</A>otherwise the changes will be lost when you exit. Alternatively, you
can switch on 'Autosave Setup' seen below.
<P>
The options are:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B>Viewer</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->

press F3. All the '!' substitutions described in <A HREF="024_L3_Associations.html">Associations
</A>can be used when specifying a viewer or an editor. If this field is
left blank, the <A HREF="038_L2_TheInternalViewer.html">Internal Viewer

<UL> Name of
an Information Presentation Facility file (*.inf) that is to be viewed when

default is fc.inf (this file). <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Left</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->

session. Default value is 'start /f'. See the OS/2 command reference for
more options for the 'start' command. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Treedir
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL>The directory where tree data is stored. If
left blank, tree data will be written to the root directory of each drive
as "fc2tree.dat". The data stored is a representation of the directory structure
of a drive and is used to avoid re-scanning the drive. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Casefilter
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL>A list of file system names (as displayed on

will be displayed as provided by the file system. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Autosave
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->

automatically perform a 'Save Setup' just before exiting the program. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Lines
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL>Sets the number of lines on screen or in window.
Can be any number supported by your video card for full screen sessions
or any value of at least 25 for a windowed session. Using a number that
is not supported by your card in a full screen session will result in the
number of lines being set to the next possible value up. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Saver
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL>The number of minutes of idle time before FC/2
<!-- entering slot 35 -->activates its screen saver. If set to 0, the screen
saver will not activate. Note that the screen saver only operates when in
a full screen session. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Numlock</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL> Specifies
if numlock should be fixed on or not. Affects both FC/2 and any program

</UL><B> Mouspeed
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL>When FC/2 is running in a full screen session,
this option specifies the sensitivity of the mouse. The default value is
8 with smaller values giving a faster mouse and larger values slowing it
down. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Scrolldelay</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL> The
time (in milliseconds) that FC/2 waits between scrolling each line when
the mouse has been used to scroll a panel or window. Only used when FC/2
is running in a full screen session. Use of this option stops the text flying
past before you've had a chance to look at it. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->

</UL><B> Codepage
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL>If non-zero, FC/2 will switch to the specified
code page. Otherwise the default code page for the session will be used.
For the best looking display, FC/2 needs to use graphics characters that
are only in code page 437 (US), specifically the line drawing characters
that join single to double lines. If another code page is active, FC/2 will
avoid using these characters. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> Use132</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL> When
on, FC/2 will use 132 column display whenever possible. 132 column mode
is only supported on some video cards in full screen sessions. Versions
of OS/2 before 3.0 do not support more than 80 columns in a window. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> PMClip
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 20 -->
<UL>When on, FC/2's internal editor will use OS/2's
PM clipboard when performing Copy/Cut/Paste operations allowing it to share
clipboard data with other programs. When this option is turned off, FC/2
reverts to using its private clipboard which operates somewhat faster. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
