<P>
 FC/2 allows you to view the current file with a choice of two viewers or
to edit the current file with a choice of two editors. To view a file, use
F3 or Alt-F3. To edit a file, use F4 or Alt-F4. The program used to view
or edit is specified in the <A HREF="034_L3_Configuration.html">Configuration
</A>dialog. By default, the built in <A HREF="038_L2_TheInternalViewer.html">Viewer
</A>and the built in <A HREF="039_L2_TheInternalEditor.html">Editor</A> are
used for F3 and F4 respectively.
<P>
 If you wish to specify the file to view or edit by typing its file name,
use Shift-F3 for view or Shift-F4 for edit. If you specify a file to edit
that does not exist, you will be given the option to create it.
<P>
 The viewer or editor can be invoked directly when starting FC/2 using the
command line switches /v or /e followed by the name of the file to be viewed
or edited. This allows other programs to call FC/2 to view or edit files
for them.
