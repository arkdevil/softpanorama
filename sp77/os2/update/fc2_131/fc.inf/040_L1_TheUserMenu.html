<!-- entering slot 41 -->
<P>
 The user menu is a list of functions defined by you to help you carry out
common tasks. It is activated by pressing F2 and then using the Up/Down
arrows and Home/End to choose an item and Enter to select or ESC to cancel.
The mouse may also be used to select a user menu choice.
<P>
 To create a user menu you need to create a plain text file (using an editor
like the OS/2 System editor "e.exe" or FC/2's internal editor) named fc.mnu
containing your list of menu functions in the same directory as fc.exe.
 Here is an example user menu file: S: Scan for viruses
<BR>
    os2scan c: d:
<BR>

<BR>
D: Dos Window
<BR>
    start /dos
<BR>

<BR>
F12: Pulse
<BR>
    start pulse
<BR>

<BR>
U: Unzip to opposite panel
<BR>
    cd !P
<BR>
    unzip !f
<BR>
    cd !p
<BR>

<P>
 A line that starts in the first column is a description line. The key used
to activate the function is first and may be any single letter or number
or one of the function keys F1-F12. After a separating colon comes the description
that will appear in the menu when it is displayed.
<P>
 Any line that starts with a space or tab is a command and will be executed
when the preceding description is chosen from the menu. It may contain the
same '!' substitutions as <A HREF="024_L3_Associations.html">Associations
</A>with the addition of the following: <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
<B><LI>t</B><!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL> Substitutes for the name of a file
and causes the command to be executed once for each tagged file. If no files
are tagged, !t is just like !.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> !l</B><!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL> Substitutes
for a list of all tagged files, space separated. The command line length
will not be allowed to grow beyond 1000 characters so if many files are
tagged, some might not make it. If this happens, the files that were not
included remain tagged after the command is executed. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL><B> !L
</B><!-- lm: 0x12 10 -->
<UL>Same as above but for the opposite panel. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> 
<P>
<B>Local User Menus</B> 
<P>
 In addition to the main user menu, you may create additional special purpose
user menus by creating an fc.mnu file in directories other than the one
containing fc.exe. When you press F2 to activate the user menu, FC/2 first
looks in the current directory for a local user menu and displays it if
found. If no fc.mnu is found in the current directory the main user menu
is displayed.
<P>
 You can force the main user menu to show by pressing Shift-F2 instead of
F2.
