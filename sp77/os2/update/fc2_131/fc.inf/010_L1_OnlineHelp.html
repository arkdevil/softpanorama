<P>
 FC/2 has an online help facility that may be called up using the F1 key.
For it to work, you must have the file fc.hlp in the same directory as fc.exe.
The text called up will depend on what state FC/2 is in when F1 is pressed.
There are separate help texts for the following:<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL> The main FC/2 screen<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL> Each of the 5 Menus<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL> The Configuration window<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL> The Confirmations window<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL> The internal viewer<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

<UL> The history window<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

<P>
 When there is more text than will fit in the window, you can use the Up
/ Down arrow, Page Up, Page Down, Home and End keys to move around or you
can click the mouse in the top or bottom thirds of the window to scroll
it (like in the <A HREF="038_L2_TheInternalViewer.html">Internal Viewer</A>).
