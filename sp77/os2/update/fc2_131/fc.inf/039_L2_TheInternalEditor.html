<P>
 The built in editor is a simple text editor that allows you to make quick
changes to any plain text file.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
<P>
o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Like the viewer, the editor will read a file using
any type of line terminator. When the file is written, however, all lines
will be CR/LF terminated. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>Although
there is no limit on the size of file you can edit, keep in mind that the
whole file is loaded into memory so opening a multi-megabyte file may strain
your swapper.dat file. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>The
editor uses the OS/2 clipboard allowing you to exchange text with other
programs. As text mode applications like FC/2 don't normally have access
to the PM clipboard, a helper PM process (clipserv.exe) needs to be used.
FC/2 automatically starts this process when needed. This feature may be
turned off using the 'pmclip' setting in the <A HREF="034_L3_Configuration.html">Configuration
</A>
<P>
<B>Note: </B> FC/2 allows the copying of blocks of text into the PM clipboard
that are greater than 64K in size. Attempting to paste such blocks of text
into a 16 bit OS/2 program will usually cause it to fail. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL> o<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>If
you edit the same file again, FC/2 will return you to the same edit position
as when you last exited the editor. <!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
</UL>
