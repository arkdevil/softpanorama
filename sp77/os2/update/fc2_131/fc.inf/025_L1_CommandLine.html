of being executed by the command interpreter. This provides the following
differences to normal command line behaviour:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>

 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->A CD command that specifies a drive letter will
change both the current drive<I> and</I> directory in one command.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 7 -->If the directory specified in a CD command does
not exist in the current directory then any tree data that has been colleted
will be searched for the directory name specified. If found, it will be
changed into.<!-- lm: 0x2 0 --><!-- lm: 0x2 0 -->
