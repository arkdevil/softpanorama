 <B>File Commander/2</B> is a 32 bit OS/2 text mode file manager and shell
that allows you to locate, copy, move, delete, view, edit and execute your
files in a quick, convenient and customisable manner.
<P>
 It's main display provides dual directory view panels that may serve as
source and destination of a copy or move operation or just two different
views of your files. A panel may also be used to view a directory tree,
drive statistics or may be turned off altogether.
<P>
 A command line is also provided and operates in conjuction with the directory
panels to make it much more powerful than a regular CLI including pasting
file names from the panel, a command history recall window and command completion
from history.
<P>
 Please remember that<B> File Commander/2</B> is Shareware. If you like
and use it, please support the shareware concept by <A HREF="003_L1_Registering.html">Registering</A>.
