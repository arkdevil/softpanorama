<P>
 The File Attributes dialog allows you to modify the 'Read Only', 'Archive',
'Hidden' and 'System' attributes of a file or a group of files. To activate
it select it from the Files <A HREF="027_L1_Menu.html">Menu</A>.
<P>
 If no files are tagged, you'll be presented with a dialog displaying the
attributes of the currently highlighted file. You can use the Up / Down
arrow to move the cursor and Space to toggle the attribute the cursor is
on or you can click on the check boxes with the mouse. 
<P>
 If you have any files tagged, you'll be presented with a slightly different
dialog. For each attribute, you can set, clear or leave alone that attribute
for all the tagged files.
<P>
 When you've set all the check boxes the way you want them, press Enter
(or click OK) to proceed or ESC (or click Cancel) to exit without changing
anything.
