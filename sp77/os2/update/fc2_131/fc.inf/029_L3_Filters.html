<P>
 The file name filter can be used to define which files you want to see
and which files you don't. It may contain up to 40, space separated file
masks that are tested from left to right. The first mask that matches a
file name will determine that file's visibility. To indicate an exclusion
file mask, precede it with a '!'. If a file name doesn't match any of the
masks, it will not be shown.
