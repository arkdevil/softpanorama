New in File Commander/2 v1.31
=============================
 
 New Features 

 o File Find now supports searching files for text and the option to search 
   either the current directory tree or the whole drive.   

 o View & edit now works directly on file find list. 
   

 Bug Fixes 

 o File name was not getting passed to external viewer/editor.   

 o Using Ctrl-NumPad-[0-9] when no panels were showing would appear to 
   work but didn't actually change the current directory for executed 
   commands.   

 o Ctrl-\ didn't work if panels off.   

 o If the current directory was changed while the panels were off, the old 
   directory's contents would show when the panels were turned back on.   

 o F1-12 would not work on user menu.
