                        README FILE FOR RUN-OS/2
                        ------------------------

This is a utility that allows OS/2 users to run OS/2 programs from a DOS
session. This program has a "search" feature, in that;
        [1] the OS/2 program does NOT have to be in the path
        [2] the user does not have to type the .EXE extension

You use this program by supplying the name of the OS/2 program that you want
to run as the first parameter, and after that you can specify whatever
parameters you wish to pass to the OS/2 program. RUN-OS/2 will search the
path for the OS/2 program, and if it is not found in the path, it will
proceed to search the entire drive. If the program is on that drive,
RUN-OS/2 will find it and try to run it.

Normally, you should supply the full name of the OS/2 program,
e.g., "RUN PMCAMERA.EXE". If the extension .EXE is not supplied
e.g., "RUN PMCAMERA", then the program will search for the various
permutations of valid executable file extensions, in the following order;
        [1] EXE
        [2] CMD
        [3] COM
        [4] BAT

The first one that matches will be executed.

The fact that RUN-OS/2 looks for .COM and .BAT extensions indicates that it
will also run DOS programs. However, it was written for the purpose of
running OS/2 programs only. On my system, it runs DOS programs alright, but
you might need to press ENTER before the DOS prompt returns to you. All I
can say however, is that you should only use it to run OS/2 programs. I
cannot be responsible for anything that happens if this advice is not
adhered to.

This program works fine on my system, but your mileage may vary. There is
really no way in which I can improve it further, so if it doesn't work fine
on your system, then sorry ... you will just have to delete it.

Examples of usage:
1. RUN OS2EMACS.EXE TODAY.TXT
      this will run os2emacs.exe, and pass "today.txt" as a parameter to it.

2. RUN CKERMIT
      this will try to locate [a] CKERMIT.EXE, or [b] CKERMIT.CMD , or
      [c] CKERMIT.COM [d] CKERMIT.BAT, in that order. When any of them
      is found, it will be run. If no match is found, then there will be an
      error message.

Note that you need to copy RUN.EXE into a directory which is in the "path"
statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.
