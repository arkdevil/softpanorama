 What is it?
 -----------

  MaxUserREXX is a REXX callable dynamic link library for OS/2's REXX
 Procedures Language/2. With MaxUserREXX and REXX you can write REXX command
 scripts that will allow you to manipulate your Maximus v2.xx USER.BBS and
 LASTUSER.BBS files. It will also allow you to query and change system
 information that relates to the user in the files IPCxx.BBS, BBSTATxx.BBS and
 MTAG.BBS. This allows you as a REXX programmer almost complete control over
 your user information from the command line.

 Installing MaxUserREXX
 ----------------------

  Simply copy the file MAXUSER.DLL to a directory on your LIBPATH, or into the
 directory you will be running your REXX command scripts from.

  THAT'S IT!


 Using MaxUserREXX
 -----------------

  It would be to your benefit to use a BACKUP copy of your USER.BBS while you
 are getting comfortable with MaxUserREXX. MaxUserREXX will NOT do anything you
 don't tell it to do. As long as you don't call CommitUser() your USER.BBS is
 safe.

  First you need to know how to write a REXX script. Writing a REXX script is
 well beyond the scope of this document, please refer to the OS/2 REXX
 Procedures Language/2 Online Reference provided with OS/2 for more
 information.

  It would also be to your benefit to have the record layout for the
 USER.BBS file handy. While MaxUserREXX makes it so that you don't need
 to know the exact layout of the file, the user structure definition
 does contain some useful information that deals with the real purpose
 of each field.

  MaxUserREXX provides 60+ functions that allow you to manipulate every aspect
 of a user record in either a USER.BBS or LASTUSER.BBS file. You will need to
 be familiar with the REXX functions RXFUNCADD and RXFUNCDROP to load and drop
 functions. However, two of the functions provided by MaxUserREXX allow you to
 easily load and drop all the functions available.

  The functions are basically divided into two groups, QueryUser... and
 SetUser..., the QueryUser functions return information about a particular
 record and the SetUser functions modify the user information of a record.

  Let's get on with the functions.. A complete list follows with the function
 being listed first then an explanation of what it does and what arguments are
 needed. All the functions will return ERROR if something goes wrong, except
 where specified.

  All index numbers into the user files are _ZERO_ (0) _NOT_ one (1) based.

  You can only have ONE user file open at a time per REXX script.

    UserLoadFuncs()

        Loads all the MaxUserREXX functions in one fell swoop. Sample
        usage:

            Call RxFuncAdd 'UserLoadFuncs', 'MaxUser', 'UserLoadFuncs'
            Call UserLoadFuncs

        If you are going to be using only a small portion of the
        functions available, you may wish to just load those functions
        using RxFuncAdd.

    UserDropFuncs()

        Drops all loaded functions. MAKE SURE IF YOU HAVE CALLED
        OpenUserFile() THAT YOU CALL CloseUserFile() BEFORE CALLING THIS
        FUNCTION.

    OpenUserFile(UserFileName)

        Allocates in memory structures needed to manipulate
        UserFileName. UserFileName can be either a USER.BBS or
        LASTUSER.BBS file. Returns the number of users in the file on
        success.

    CommitUser(UserIndex)

        Commits all modifications made to the user record at UserIndex
        by writing the changes to disk.

    CloseUserFile()

        Closes out and releases all in-memory structures for the last
        Open'ed user file. MAKE SURE YOU CALL THIS FUNCTION _BEFORE_
        CALLING UserDropFuncs()!

    CopyUserToFile(UserIndex, TargetFile)

        Appends the user record at UserIndex to TargetFile, creating
        TargetFile if necessary.

        This function can be used to perform a `pack' of the main user
        file by looping through the user records, calling
        QueryUserFlags() for each record. If the DEL flag is not set
        then call this function to write the record to a new user file.

        Something similar to:

            usercount = OpenUserFile('USER.BBS')
            do userindex = 0  to usercount-1
                if Pos('DEL', QueryUserFlags(userindex))=0 then
                    call CopyUserToFile userindex, 'NEWUSER.BBS'
                else
                    Say 'User 'QueryUserName(userindex)' purged..'
            end
            Call CloseUserFile

        You can also add a user to the user file with this function.
        EXERCISE CAUTION WHEN ADDING A USER WITH THIS FUNCTION! What
        you will need to do is something like:

            usercount = OpenUserFile('TEMPLATE.BBS')
            if usercount<>'ERROR' then do
                call CopyUserToFile '0', 'USER.BBS'
                call CloseUserFile
            end

        TEMPLATE.BBS would be a file that could hold one or more user
        templates. Make sure to test for the presence of ACTIVExx.BBS
        files, so you don't stomp on Maximus' efforts to work with the
        user file.

    SwapUsers(UserIndex1, UserIndex2)

        Swaps the user records at UserIndex1 and UserIndex2. Make sure
        you CommitUser() BOTH records after calling this function.

    FindUser(StartIndex, UserName)

        Returns the zero based index of UserName starting from
        StartIndex. Returns StartIndex if UserName is not found. Both
        the Name and Alias fields of the user records are compared to
        UserName to find a match. NOTE: This is a brute force search.

    QueryUserName(UserIndex)

        Returns the Name of the user at UserIndex or an empty string if
        UserIndex is out of range.

    QueryUserAlias(UserIndex)

    QueryUserLastReadOffset(UserIndex)

        Returns the Last Read Offset of the user at UserIndex or an empty
        string if UserIndex is out of range. NOTE: This is an offset
        into the LASTREAD.BBS files for *.MSG areas or the offset into
        the *.SQL files for Squish areas. If you don't understand this
        part of the user record it is best for you to leave it alone.

    QueryUserTimeRemaining(UserIndex)

        Returns the time remaining for the current call. This is useless
        unless you are working with a LASTUSER.BBS file.

        Returns the Password of the user at UserIndex or an empty string
        if UserIndex is out of range.
