VBScript Version 1.1
--------------------
VBScript is a scripting language which can be used to create,
delete, and manipulate Visual Basic controls and forms at
design time.

To use VBScript, add VBSCRIPT.VBX to your Visual Basic project and
use the VBScript window to edit and run your script.  The syntax of
the VBScript language mimics Visual Basic's, and a full description
of the language is located in the Help file.
