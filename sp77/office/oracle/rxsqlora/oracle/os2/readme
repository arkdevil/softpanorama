                            REXX/SQL
                           for Oracle
                              OS/2


This directory contains the source code for REXX/SQL for Oracle under
OS/2 and executables, both .exe and .dll's.

For REXX/SQL to function correctly as an OS/2 DLL, it requires an Oracle
DLL; ORA732.DLL. There are various flavours of this DLL, depending on
whether you have the Oracle7 Server for OS/2 or SQL*Net for OS/2. The
names of these DLLs are similar.

If you do not have the DLL with this exact name, there will be one with
a similar name in the ORACLE_HOME/DLL directory. Copy this file to ORA732.DLL
(in the same directory) and REXX/SQL should then work.
