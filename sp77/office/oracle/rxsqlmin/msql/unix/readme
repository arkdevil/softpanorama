This directory contains a configuration program; written in REXX of
course :-) so you must have built (or have available) a REXX interpreter.
This program is intended to create a makefile to build REXX/SQL based on
the makefile supplied with either Regina or REXX/imc, and the makefile
generated when you built mSQL.

You may have to make some minor adjustments to the built makefile
once the Configuration script has run.
