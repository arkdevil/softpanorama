                 A REXX interface to SQL databases


General:
-------
REXX/SQL provides a simple interface for REXX programs to access SQL databases
through a number of external functions. REXX/SQL is intended to provide a 
consistant interface to all SQL databases.

REXX/SQL is distributed under the GNU General Public License. See the file 
COPYING for more details.  The "home" anon ftp site for REXX/SQL is:
ftp.qut.edu.au/src/REXXSQL

The source code for each database interface code is in a separate archive 
file. The general format of the archive files is:

rxsql???nn.ext

where:  ??? is the TLA for the database port, nn is the version number and
ext is the archive file type. eg. the REXX/SQL Oracle port for Version 1.2
in compressed tar file format is; rxsqlora12.tar.Z.

Documentation, in Postscript and HTML is available in rxsqldocnn.ext and
sample programs are in rxsqlsamnn.ext.

The documentation is intended as both a user's guide and a reference
guide for implementors of REXX/SQL on other database and operating system 
platforms.

All text files are stored in Unix text file format. ie LF only.
