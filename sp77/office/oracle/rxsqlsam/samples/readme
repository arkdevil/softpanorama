                               REXX/SQL

                            Sample Programs


This directory contains sample programs demonstrating the use of REXX/SQL.

All programs assume that specific database/owners/tables exist or have
been created.

Under Oracle, all sample programs assume that the demo user, SCOTT with
password TIGER owns the table EMP.

Under mSQL, a database with the name TEST has been created, and a table;
EMP, has been created and populated.
A REXX/SQL program msqlsetup.rex, has been provided to create and populate
the EMP table.

Invocation of Sample Programs
-----------------------------

All sample program have been supplied as *.rex files.  Under all platforms,
the sample programs can be executed by executing the rexxsql exectable and
passing the name of the sample program as the first argument to the rexxsql
executable. eg. rexxsql sample.rex

Under Unix it is possible to execute the sample programs directly from the
shell prompt.  This is possible with most shell's "magic number" behaviour.

If the first line of a text file, which has its executable bit set, starts
with #! , then the shell will invoke the program following these two
characters and pass the remainder of the file to that program. eg. If the
Regina interpreter has been installed in /opt/bin, then add the line:

#!/opt/bin/rexx

to the top of the sample program.  The program can then be invoked simply
with the filename; sample.rex.

NB.  Most Unix shells have a bug that permits only about 15 characters
     to follow the #!.  Any more chanracters than this limit will be
     truncated, and the shell will not find the program to execute.

Under OS/2, the sample programs can be invoked directly from the command
line.  Simply rename the file, making the extension .CMD instead of .REX.
You must have moved the REXXSQL.DLL file to a directory specified in your
LIBPATH.
