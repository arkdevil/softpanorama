A software test project I am on is attempting
to categorize test cases.  Two of the categories
are Stress and Performance.  There has been much
group discussion with regard to the best
definition of each category, but we are not able
to agree on a final definition.

This is turning out to be much more difficult than
we anticipated, and I am hoping that someone can
direct me (us) to a good reference book/paper, or
can speak from personal experience.  What is the
difference between Stress and Performance ??

Our main "sticky" point is that we do not wish to
define test cases that go beyond the requirements,
(some people's view of Stress is actually that), and
we must verify that we meet the requirements in many
areas, performance being one of them.  The performance
category is fairly straight forward, but where does
Stress fit ??

Any information or philosophical views would be
appreciated.  Thanks for your time and effort.
