There is now an Object REXX home page available at

http://www2.hursley.ibm.com/orexx/

We've seeded this with IBM's response to a SHARE white paper
on the future of REXX plus a couple of articles that appeared
with the beta versions on the Developer's Connection.  The
first article is a nice introduction to the concepts behind Object
REXX.
