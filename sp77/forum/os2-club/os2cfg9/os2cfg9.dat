 VIEWING FILE:  Beginning with version 9, when you use the
 Enhanced Editor and include the enclosed STYLE and ATTRIB files,
 new items to this file will appear in light red.  Regardless of
 which editor you use, for best results turn word wrap OFF and
 use a monospaced (like System Monospaced) font.
  
 PRINTING FILE:  Now in enhanced JB format or easy printing.
  
 INF FORMAT:  Don Parr of Riverside, CA., another OS/2 zealot,
 has taken it upon himself to convert this file to the INF format. 
 Version 7 is out and circulating.  Look for it on OS/2 SHAREWARE
 and OS/2 CONNECTION BBSs.  Thanks Don for this great effort!

1.  CAUTION, WARNING AND DISCLAIMER.                               
 
 <<=CAUTION=>>  Because of the way in which OS/2s Enhanced PM
 editor (EPM.EXE) handles word wrapping and its restricted line
 length, using it to edit your config.sys file is unwise.  For
 best results, use OS/2s System Editor (E.EXE).
  
 <<=WARNING=>> If you plan on changing any line in your current
 config.sys file, please be sure to create a backup --BEFORE-- 
 you start experimenting!  This has saved me more than once.  
 Remember, make the backup --BEFORE-- you change your config.sys
 file.  If you are viewing this information using CNFGINFO.EXE,
 use its backup option before you proceed any further.
  
 A procedure for restoring a damaged config.sys is included
 at the end of this file.

 <<=DISCLAIMER=>>  I CAN'T BE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT YOU DO WITH
 YOUR SYSTEM OR YOUR CONFIG.SYS FILE BASED UPON WHAT YOU MAY
 LEARN FROM THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS FILE.  EVERY EFFORT
 HAS BEEN MADE TO MAKE THIS FILE AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE, BUT
 NO WARRANTY OR FITNESS IS IMPLIED.  THE INFORMATION IS PROVIDED
 ON AN "AS IS" BASIS.  USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

2.  COMMENTS.                                                        
 
 This whole process started in 1992 when I began researching
 what many of the config.sys file commands were for.  This ever
 growing file is the result of that ongoing research.  It briefly
 describes most of the common and some of the more obscure
 commands.  Naturally, not all possible commands are listed
 (especially the many hardware device drivers), but there is a
 lot here for you to work with.  Version 6 was the first version
 updated for OS/2 2.1 and version 9 was the first updated for
 OS/2 Warp.
 
 Even with all the hours I've put into this description, I still
 find the config.sys file to be somewhat of a mystery.  Still,
 mystery or not, to get the most out of OS/2 and your system
 you just may need to spend a little time editing your config.sys.
 
 ----------------- IMPORTANT NOTE AND WARNING --------------------
 
 Unlike the DOS config.sys file which is read sequentially, OS/2 
 reads the entire file before it invokes the commands listed.  
 Therefore, except for several exceptions which have been noted,
 it really doesn't matter where a command is placed. On several
 of the "nets" and in a file called CNFGSORT.ZIP it has been
 suggested that if you organize your config.sys file in a certain
 way, you can significantly shorten the boot time of OS/2.  I
 find this sorting to be of little or no help for the vast
 majority of OS/2 users.  Further, you can cause yourself
 problems if you do it incorrectly.  So be very careful and have
 a backup config.sys file ready.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
3.  THE PROGRAM CNFGINFO.EXE.                                        
  
 I'm really not much of a programmer, but I have written a  
 program called CNFGINFO.EXE which allows you to analysis your
 own config.sys file.  After it reads in your config.sys file,
 you just point and click on any line and information from this
 file is displayed.  It also will backup, edit and print your
 config.sys file.  You can also print this file.  Its Freeware
 (that means you can use it at no cost and pass it on to your
 friends), but its not in the public domain.  The "" symbols
 are used by CNFGINFO, so please do not remove them from this 
 file.  The latest version of CNFGINFO.EXE can be downloaded as 
 CFGINFO3.ZIP from the same BBS where you found this file.  This 
 version fixes several bugs, including the one which would not
 allow you to load any config.sys file from a drive other than
 "C".  Many additional features have also been added.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------
4.  BEGINNING OF CONFIG.SYS FILE DESCRIPTION.                        
 
 The order of this description area generally follows that of
 a "standard" config.sys file.
 
CALL=C:\OS2\XCOPY.EXE C:\OS2\INSTALL\*.BK1 C:\OS2\INSTALL\*.INI /T /R /O
CALL=C:\OS2\XCOPY.EXE C:\OS2\*.INI C:\OS2\INSTALL\*.BK1 /T /R /O
  
 Two files are essential to the operation of OS/2:  OS2.INI and 
 OS2SYS.INI.  If these files should get trashed, OS/2 isn't going
 to function.  Backing them up is very important.  In OS/2 
 version 2.0, once booted, OS/2 will not let you access or copy
 these critical files.  One way to circumvent this is to create
 your backups BEFORE OS/2 is booted.  This CALL will do the trick.
 It creates first a backup of your backup and then creates a
 backup of the original files.  This gives you a two generation
 backup.  This process will add time to your system boot.
  
 Generally OS/2 does not care where you place something in the 
 config.sys file.  This CALL is an exception in version 2.0.  It 
 must appear before any other line because you need to complete 
 this backup process before OS2.INI AND OS2SYS.INI load.  
  
 <<=NOTE=>>  In version 2.1, the INI files can be copied after
 the system is booted by using OS/2s COPY command, but you may
 wish to consider adding this CALL to your config.sys file to
 automate the process.
   
 <<=NOTE=>>  In OS/2 Warp, IBM provides a archive feature
 which can be activated by opening your Desktop settings, click
 on the Archive Tab, and then click on "Create archive at every
 system restart".  You do not need this CALL if you use this
 archive feature.

 <<=TIP=>>  OS2.INI and OS2SYS.INI can also be reconstructed at
 boot by holding down Alt-F1 during boot BEFORE the OS/2 logo
 appears.  You may need to hold the keys down for at least 20
 seconds.  During your initial installation of OS/2, the 
 installation process stored a copy of its original INI files
 in the folder called INSTALL.  When you press Alt-F1 at boot,
 OS/2 moves these "backup" files into the OS/2 folder to
 replace the current versions.  The "CALL" shown above keeps
 the INI files in your INSTALL folder current.
  
 <<=WARNING=>>  If you are using a version of OS/2 before Warp,
 use the Alt-F1 key combination as a last resort because you may
 lose all customizing and changes you have made to the WpS.
  
 <<=NOTE=>>  The switches used mean the following:
 
      /T  -- allows xcopying of files with System attribute
      /R  -- allows xcopying of files with Read-only attribute
      /O  -- allows xcopying *onto* a file which has System,
             Read-only, or Hidden attribute.
 
 Thanks to Melissa Woo for pointing out the need for these
 switches.

IFS=C:\OS2\HPFS.IFS /CACHE:512 /CRECL:4 /AUTOCHECK:CD
   
 IFS stands for "Installable File System".  This OS/2 command 
 installs the High Performance File System (HPFS).  The syntax
 is IFS=DRIVE:PATH\FILENAME,SWITCHES.  There are three switches:
  
 /CACHE:nnn sets up a disk cache and its size.  The default on 
 most systems (shown in Table 1.0 below) is low in my opinion.  
  
 <<=TIP=>>  Change the size of your disk cache based upon the 
 information provided in Table 1.1 below.  This great stuff was 
 provided by Proportional Software based upon a great deal of
 OS/2 system tweaking done by the DCF/2 development team.  
  
 <<=Warning=>>  Keep this one truth in mind about cache size:
 an excessive cache takes memory available for programs and
 therefore could have a negative impact on overall system
 performance.  For example, if you set a 2MB cache on a 6MB
 system, you will notice a substantial negative performance hit.  
  
 OS/2s Command Reference and other IBM sources indicate that 
 the maximum cache size for HPFS is currently 2MB (2048), but
 IBM does not recommend using a cache larger than 1.5MB (1536).
 Personally, I have 16MB of RAM and have my HPFS cache set to
 the max:  2048.
  
 If this switch is omitted, the default is 10% of the available
 RAM.
  
 ========================== Table 1.0 ===========================
  
 If you have formatted your system with only HPFS partitions, the 
 cache size in this statement, as set by OS/2 during installation,
 is that noted under ONE FILE SYSTEM in the table below.  If you 
 have both FAT and HPFS partitions, then OS/2 sets the cache
 sizes to those noted under TWO FILE SYSTEM.  The file system
 which uses the greatest amount of your disk space gets the larger
 default value.
  
 MEMORY SIZE IN MB      TWO FILE SYSTEM         ONE FILE SYSTEM
        4                       128/64                  128
        5                       128/64                  128
        6                       256/64                  256
        7                       256/128                 256
        8                       256/256                 384
        9                       256/256                 384
        10 - 16                 512/512                 1024
        17 - 32                 1024/1024               2048
 ================================================================
  
 ========================== Table 1.1 ===========================
  
 You can get better performance from your system by using your 
 available RAM in the most efficient and effective way.  Select
 the case that best describes the file system or amount of RAM
 you use. 
  
 CASE 1:  You use only HPFS or only FAT, but not both.           
  
                               HPFS only.         FAT only.
 System memory of at least:  Set CACHE to:    Set DISKCACHE to:
  
                     16 MB            2048                 2048
                     12 MB            1536                 1536
                      8 MB            1024                 1024
  
 CASE 2:  You use both HPFS and FAT with HPFS active and FAT
 passive.
  
 System memory of at least:  Set CACHE to:    Set DISKCACHE to:
  
                     16 MB            2048            512 -1024
                     12 MB            1536            256 - 512
                      8 MB            1024            128 - 256
  
 CASE 3:  You use both HPFS and FAT with HPFS passive and FAT
 active.
  
 System memory of at least:  Set CACHE to:    Set DISKCACHE to:
                     
                     16 MB            1024                 2048
                     12 MB             768                 1536
                      8 MB             512                 1024
 
 <<=NOTE=>>  For purposes of the table above, "active" and
 "passive" are descriptors for the way a partition is used. 
 If it is seldom used, it is "passive."  If a lot of disk 
 intensive I/O occurs on the partition, it is "active."
 
 ================================================================
 
 /CRECL sets the maximum record size for caching, from 2k to 64k
 in multiples of 2k with a default of 4k.  This parameter may not
 exceed 1/4 of the total cache size set with the /cache parameter.
 
 /AUTOCHECK:nn tells the system to run CHKDSK and sets the drives
 to be checked at start up.
 
 <<=WARNING=>> If you don't include the AUTOCHECK switch in this
 command, the system will not boot.

 <<=TIP=>>  If you are using only FAT partitions, then you should
 REM this IFS statement and save yourself some RAM.  How much?
 I've seen figures from 130k to 500k, but the HPFS.IFS file is 
 136k in size.
 
 <<=TIP=>>  If you have drive partitions larger than 80MB, then
 HPFS should give you better performance than FAT.  On partitions
 of less than 80MB, most authorities indicate that there is only a
 small performance difference between HPFS and FAT.  Consider the
 following when comparing the relative merits of the HPFS versus
 FAT:  On large partitions of identical size, the HPFS will
 generally give you about 15% more space and improve performance
 by about 28% (Information provided by Proportional Software).
 
 <<=NOTE=>>  Lazy write is on by default.  If you want lazy write
 off, see the RUN=C:\OS2\CACHE.EXE command later in this file.

PAUSEONERROR=YES
   
 This command tells OS/2 to pause after it finds any error in your
 config.sys and displays an error message.  If you don't include
 this statement in your config.sys file, the default will be YES.
 This is generally the best choice since the error message will
 appear and scroll off the screen so quickly with a NO setting that
 you may not notice it.

PROTSHELL=C:\OS2\PMSHELL.EXE
   
 This OS/2 command tells OS/2 what program you want to use as the 
 protect mode shell (the program that determines what your user
 interface looks like and how it operates.)  This is the first
 program OS/2 will execute.  PMSHELL.EXE is the program which
 initializes OS/2 Presentation Manager.  If you delete this line
 from your config.sys file, OS/2 will load PMSHELL.EXE by default.
 
 <<=NOTE=>>  There are at least two alternatives to PMSHELL.EXE.
 One is OS/2s own CMD.EXE.  If you replace PMSHELL.EXE with 
 CMD.EXE, you will get a full screen OS/2 session only and will
 not be able to run PM programs.  A second alternative is
 TSHELL.EXE.  TSHELL is a text-based, protected-mode shell for
 OS/2.  Any one remember OS/2 1.x? TSHELL makes OS/2 look
 something like OS/2 1.0.  OS/2 1.0 did not have a graphical
 user interface.  
 
 With TSHELL you can start and switch full-screen sessions only. 
 These can be OS/2, DOS, or WINOS2 sessions depending on your
 systems configuration.  You use Alt+Esc to switch around
 sessions and Ctrl+Esc to pop up the task list.  But please note,
 like OS/2 1.0, there is no Presentation Manager. Thus, OS/2 PM
 applications will not work. You can download TSHELL.ZIP from
 most OS/2 BBSs.

SET COMMAND:  The SET command in the config.sys file sets up 
 environment variables for the entire system.  These
 environment variables are stored by OS/2 in memory and are
 shared by any applications which calls on them.    
 
 <<=TIP=>>  If you want to see what variables are set in your 
 system, at an OS/2 command prompt type the word SET and press 
 <enter>.  You'll get a list like the following:
 
     WP_OBJHANDLE=87103
     USER_INI=C:\OS2\OS2.INI
     SYSTEM_INI=C:\OS2\OS2SYS.INI
     OS2_SHELL=C:\OS2\CMD.EXE
     AUTOSTART=PROGRAMS,TASKLIST,FOLDERS
     RUNWORKPLACE=C:\OS2\PMSHELL.EXE
     COMSPEC=C:\OS2\CMD.EXE
     PATH=C:\OS2;C:\OS2\SYSTEM;C:\OS2\MDOS\WINOS2;
        C:\OS2\INSTALL;C:\;C:\OS2\MDOS;
     DPATH=C:\OS2;C:\OS2\SYSTEM;C:\OS2\MDOS\WINOS2;
        C:\OS2\INSTALL;C:\;C:\OS2\BITMAP;
     PROMPT=$E[1;33m[$P]$G

     EPMPATH=C:\OS2\APPS;
     VIDEO_DEVICES=VIO_SVGA
     VIO_SVGA=DEVICE(BVHVGA,BVHSVGA)
     ZOCDEVICE=COM4
     MMBASE=C:\MMOS2;
     DSPPATH=C:\MMOS2\DSP;
     NCDEBUG=4000
     VXREXX=D:\VXREXX
     WORKPLACE__PROCESS=NO

SET USER_INI=F:\OS2\OS2.INI
 
 Tells OS/2 the name and locations of the file that contains
 your desktop setup information and the options saved from
 various OS/2 applications.  OS2.INI is the default file name.  
 
 <<=NOTE=>>  OS2.INI is a critical file for the proper operation
 of OS/2 and should not be deleted or modified.  It is not an
 ASCII file and, if it should become damaged, cannot be modified
 with an ASCII editor.  You should consider backing up this file
 by using the CALL lines shown above or with a program such as
 WPSBKUP.  It is one of several shareware programs design for
 this purpose.  Check your favorite OS/2 BBS.  You can also use
 MAKEINI.EXE, which ships with OS/2, to build a new set of INI
 files.  See your OS/2 documentation on how to do this.

SET SYSTEM_INI=G:\OS2\OS2SYS.INI
 
 Tells OS/2 the name and location of OS2SYS.INI.  This file
 tells OS/2 what kind of equipment your system uses.  NOTE:
 OS2SYS.INI is a critical files and should not be deleted or
 modified.  It is not an ASCII file.  You should consider backing
 up this file by using the CALL line shown as the first line
 above or with a program such as WPSBKUP, a shareware program you
 can obtain on many OS/2 BBSs.  You can also use MAKEINI.EXE,
 which ships with OS/2, to build a new set of INI files.  See
 your OS/2 documentation on how to do this.

 
 This file remains open the entire time OS/2 is booted and
 operating.  It only closes upon shut down.  If it should become
 "trashed", MAKEINI.EXE, which ships with OS/2 and is in the OS2
 directory, can be used to build a new set of INI files.  You
 will have to boot from an OS/2 floppy to do so.

SET OS2_SHELL=D:\OS2\CMD.EXE
  
 OS2_SHELL directs OS/2 to load the command line shell (CMD.EXE)
 when you ask for an OS/2 command line from the WpS.  
  
 <<=WARNING=>>  Be careful with this line, OS/2 will not start 
 without it.
  
 <<=TIP=>>  If you wish to run some other command line shell,
 such as 4OS2, change this line and the SET COMSPEC=C:\OS2\CMD.EXE
 line, substituting the appropriate EXE file for CMD.EXE.
 
 <<=TIP=>>  If you have a need to have a .CMD file invoked when
 you launch any OS/2 full screen or windowed session, just as 
 AUTOEXEC.BAT is invoked for DOS sessions, modify this command
 line as shown below and it will cause AUTOEXEC.CMD to be invoked
 each time you start an OS/2 session.
 
     SET OS2_SHELL=C:\OS2\CMD.EXE /k C:\AUTOEXEC.CMD
 
 You can choose any file name you wish for the CMD file. 
 AUTOEXEC.CMD is used just as an example.

SET AUTOSTART=PROGRAMS,TASKLIST,FOLDERS,CONNECTIONS,LAUNCHPAD
  
 The AUTOSTART command contains a list of WpS components which
 will be started (or restarted) when the system is booted up.
 There are currently four possible options:
 
 PROGRAMS:  Tells OS/2 to start applications, that were running 
            when the system was shut down, to restart.  This
            options will be ignored if SET RESTARTOBJECTS=NO.
 
 TASKLIST:  This parameter enables the OS/2 task list that appears 
            when you press Ctrl+Esc.  Why this parameter is
            available I don't know, because even when removed, I
            have still been able to press Ctrl+Esc and get the task
            list.  Oh well, another OS/2 mystery.
 
 FOLDERS:   Opens the desktop and any other folder which was open 
            when the system was shut down.  
 
            <<=WARNING=>>  If you remove the FOLDERS statement,
            OS/2 will not open your desktop (which is a folder).  
             
 CONNECTIONS:  This parameter restarts any network connections 
               that were in use when the system was shut down.  
 
            <<=NOTE=>>  This parameter can be removed if your
            system is not connected to a network.  Leaving it
            in your config.sys file will NOT cause any problems.
 
 LAUNCHPAD:  Restarts the new Lauchpad supplied with Warp.

SET RUNWORKPLACE=C:\OS2\PMSHELL.EXE
  
 This line tells the system what interface program is to be
 used.  In this case it is the Workplace Shell.
  
 <<=TIP=>>  If you want to run OS/2 with only a command line 
 interface,  you can do so by changing this line to read 
 SET RUNWORKPLACE=C:\OS2\CMD.EXE.  This brings OS/2 up without
 the WpS and gives you one screen session.  You can start other 
 sessions using the START or DETACH command.  Otherwise,
 operated just like you were in DOS.  If you have started more
 than one session, switch between them using Alt+Esc.  For those
 who want the power of OS/2 and like to work only from a command
 line, give this a try.  I'm running in this mode as I write this
 as a test and it appears to work fine.
  
 This is also a way to improve performance on 4MB RAM systems,
 since the WpS take up LOTS of ram.  When running without the 
 WpS, I generally free up from 4 to 5 megs of RAM on my 16MB
 system.
  
 <<=WARNING=>>  You can't perform a "shut down" from a command
 line.  To do a shut down type PMSHELL and press enter.  This
 starts the WpS.  Once the WpS is open, you should be able to
 perform a standard shut down.  You can also download one of
 several shut down programs available on most OS/2 specific
 BBSs.  I use one called SHUT32.ZIP.
 
 <<=TIP=>>  MSHELL.EXE is another alternative.  It is a simple
 mini shell for OS/2 that uses the replaceable shell 
 architecture of the WpS.  MSHELL is a program launcher which
 provides one list of programs to start.  This list can be
 modified by creating a plain text file called MSHELL.INI. In
 addition to starting programs, MSHELL can save the desktop,
 interact with the spooler, and do a system shut down.
 
 MSHELL is IBM Employee Written Software and can be downloaded
 from most OS/2 specific BBSs or ftp.cdrom.com. 

SET RESTARTOBJECTS=YES
  
 This command tells OS/2 what applications to start after you
 suspend operations with or without doing a shut down. If this
 statement is not in your config.sys, then the default is YES,
 i.e., start all objects that were running at the time of shut
 down or reboot.  Other options are:
 
  NO = do not start any applications that were running at time 
       of shut down or reboot.  
  
  STARTUPFOLDERSONLY = start objects only in the Startup 
       folder.  This parameter is also handy for another
       purpose.  Lets assume you have one or more programs in
       your Startup folder and do a shut down without closing
       those programs.  If you have Restartobjects set to yes,
       OS/2 will restart the programs left open AND the Startup 
       folder will start another copy of the same programs.
       Thus you will have two copies running.  Using this
       parameter eliminates this.
 
  REBOOTONLY = Start objects only if the OS/2 WpS is starting 
       from a reboot (Ctrl-Alt-Del) or at power on.  Objects 
       will not restart if the WpS is restarted as a result of 
       its own error correction recycling.
  
 <<=TIP=>>  You can also circumvent the auto-starting of
 programs by holding down Left/Ctrl-Left/Shift-F1 all at the
 same time during boot.  It must be done right after the clock
 appears just before the desktop loads, but before any icons
 appear.

SET COMSPEC=C:\OS2\CMD.EXE
  
 This line identifies what OS/2 command line shell is to be used
 and its location.  In DOS, COMMAND.COM is equivalent to CMD.EXE.
  
 <<=TIP=>>  If you wish to run some other command line shell,
 such as 4OS2, change this and the SET OS2_SHELL=C:\OS2\CMD.EXE
 line, substituting the appropriate EXE file for CMD.EXE.

LIBPATH=.;C:\OS2\DLL;C:\OS2\MDOS;C:\;C:\OS2\APPS\DLL;
  
 Tells OS/2 where to locate Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs).  
 LIBPATH is similar to DPATH and PATH, but the statement can
 only be used in the config.sys file and OS/2 does not search the
 current directory for DLLs unless you include it in the LIBPATH
 statement.  You don't need to use the SET command with LIBPATH. 
 It is not an environment variable.
 
 <<=TIP=>>  To reduce the search time, be sure that the various
 PATH statements contain the correct path to your program and
 other files.  You can also have OS/2 search the current directory
 by including a period "." right after the equal "=" symbol.   This
 causes OS/2 to look in the current logged directory first.
 
 One final item that will reduce search time:  Be certain that
 the PATH, LIBPATH and DPATH statements in the config.sys are
 arranged with the most frequently accessed sub directories
 listed first. 

SET PATH=C:\OS2;C:\OS2\SYSTEM;C:\OS2\MDOS\WINOS2;C:\OS2\INSTALL;
   C:\;C:\OS2\MDOS;C:\OS2\APPS;
  
 Just like in DOS, it tells OS/2 where to find programs.  For DOS
 sessions, set the PATH in your Autoexec.bat file.
  
 <<=WARNING=>>  Your path statement should contain at least the
 following directories:  \OS2, \OS2\MDOS, \OS2\SYSTEM.

SET DPATH=C:\OS2;C:\OS2\SYSTEM;C:\OS2\MDOS\WINOS2;C:\OS2\INSTALL;
  C:\;C:\OS2\MDOS;C:\OS2\APPS;
  
 This is an OS/2 command.  It tells OS/2 programs where to look
 for data files.  It is similar to the DOS APPEND command, but
 unlike APPEND, DPATH only works with programs designed to use
 it.

SET PROMPT=[$P]$G
 
 Like the same DOS command, this line sets how your OS/2 command
 prompt will appear.  (This is for OS/2 only.  Set the DOS PROMPT 
 default in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.)  In the setting shown here,
 the command prompt will appear showing the current directory of
 the default drive enclosed in [] followed by the greater than
 symbol, i.e. [C:\]>.  Having brackets [] around the drive and
 directory information lets you quickly know when you are at an
 OS/2 command line verse a DOS command line.  
 
 If you type PROMPT without a parameter, OS/2 will return its 
 default prompt.
 
 Options include:
 
     $B = The | character
     $C = The open parenthesis (
     $D = Current date
     $E = ASCII code 27 (escape) so you can work with ANSI.
        See <<=TIP=>> below.
     $F = The close parenthesis )
     $G = The "greater than" > symbol
     $H = BACKSPACE over the previous character
     $I = Turns help line on
     $L = The "less than" < character
     $N = Default drive
     $P = Current directory of default drive
     $Q = The equal = character
     $S = The space character
     $T = Current time
     $V = OS/2 version number
     $_ = Carriage return or line feed
 
 <<=TIP=>>  You can also add ANSI control sequences to your
 prompt.  For example, to help me know visually whether I'm
 working with an OS/2 command line, I've add $E[1;33m to my
 prompt line, i.e. SET PROMPT=$E[1;33m[$P]$G.  This sets text
 to display in bold yellow characters.  

SET HELP=C:\OS2\HELP;C:\OS2\HELP\TUTORIAL;
 
 Tells OS/2 where the help files are located.  OS/2 will only
 look for its help files in the path shown.

SET GLOSSARY=C:\OS2\HELP\GLOSS;
 
 Tells OS/2 where Glossary and Master Help files are located.

SET DIRCMD=/ON /P
 
 An undocumented command that is the OS/2 equivalent of the DIR
 command in DOS.  Since DOS 5, you can tell DIR how to present
 file information.  To do this in OS/2, use the DIRCMD command.
 For example:  SET DIRCMD=/ON /P tells OS/2 to display the DIR 
 information in alpha order and place a pause at the end of each
 page.
 
 <<=NOTE=>>  This is for OS/2 only.  Set the DOS default in your
 AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
 
   Options include:
 
   /A list files with specific attributes.  E.g. /AH list only 
      hidden files.  Other options are S A & R.  If you place a 
      negative (-) sign in front of your specified attribute, 
      all files will list except those with the attribute 
      specified.  E.g. /A-H-S will display all files except 
      hidden and system files.
   /B list directories and files without heading and summary 
      information.
   /F list files with the full drive and path information.  
      Date, time and size are omitted.
   /L displays information in lowercase.
   /N lists files on a FAT drive in the same format used for a 
      HPFS drive, i.e. date, time, size, name.
   /O list files according to sort option specified.  Sort 
      options are:
         G = Display directories first.
         N = alphabetize by file name
        -N = reverse-alphabetizes by name
         E = alphabetize by extension
        -E = reverse-alphabetizes by extension
         D = by date, oldest first
        -D = by date, newest first
         S = by file size, smallest first
        -S = by file size, largest first
   /P pauses after a full screen of files is listed.
   /R displays long file names if applicable.
   /S searches and displays all directories.
   /W displays file names across the screen.  Date, time and 
      size are omitted.

LASTDRIVE=H
 
 Specifies the maximum number of drives that are accessible.
 The value you specify with LASTDRIVE represents the last valid
 drive that is recognized. 

SET IPF_KEYS=SBCS
 
 The character set for most languages can be represented as data
 using an 8-bit byte since their characters sets are each less
 than 256 characters.  These are called single-byte character sets
 (SBCS).  Languages such as Japanese (Kanji), Korean and Chinese 
 (both Traditional and Simplified) can only be represented using
 two 8-bit bytes or 16-bits.  These are double-byte character
 sets (DBCS).
 
 This command tells the Information Presentation Facility (INF
 and help files) which type of character set is being used, i.e.,
 Single or Double Byte Character Set.  This is an environment
 variable.  Removing it from my system did not seem to have any
 impact.

PRIORITY_DISK_IO=YES
 
 This command determines whether programs running in the fore-
 ground have priority access to disks.  The default is YES.  If
 you want a program running in the background, like a BBS, to
 have equal access to your disks, then change this statement to
 NO.  If you change this command to no and then find that your
 communications program does not work, change back to yes.

PRIORITY=DYNAMIC
 
 OS/2 automatically assigns processing priorities to each thread
 of a program as it begins processing.  A thread running in the
 foreground will generally have priority over a thread running
 in background.  Thread priorities are adjusted, generally based
 upon how active they are, by OS/2 on an ongoing basis to make
 sure each thread has adequate processing time.  On the rare
 occasion that you need to run a program which must never change
 in priority, you should set PRIORITY=ABSOLUTE, otherwise, don't
 mess with it.
 
 <<=NOTE=>>  This command does not have to be in your config.sys.
 If it isn't, OS/2 defaults to PRIORITY=DYNAMIC.
 
 Here are some interesting and comments posted by David Page.
 "I strongly suggest that you read "The Design of OS2" by Deitel
 and Kogan; Addison Wesley. It goes into great detail on this
 topic.

 "To summarize: The highest priority thread always has the
 machine.  If there are two equally high threads, they timeslice
 having the machine.  Note that there are many Operating System
 threads, like the scheduler itself, that are higher priority
 than any program. Now, if PRIORITY=ABSOLUTE in the config.sys
 file, that's all there is to it.  But usually, PRIORITY=DYNAMIC,
 and OS/2 keeps gradually increasing the priority of a starved
 thread until it gets to run. Maxwait determines the maximum
 time, in seconds, before the scheduler intervenes to raise a
 low priority thread up high enough to run."

FILES=20
 
 This is a standard DOS command which sets the maximum number
 of files that DOS can access at the same time.  OS/2 sets the
 install default is 20, but some DOS programs may require an
 increased number.  The maximum parameter is 255.  The FILES
 command is for DOS only and has no effect on OS/2 sessions
 which can have up to 64,000 files open at the same time.

DEVICE=C:\OS2\TESTCFG.SYS
DEVICE=C:\OS2\BOOT\TESTCFG.SYS  <---- In Warp
 
 TESTCFG.SYS is used during the install process to test your
 systems configuration.  It is also used by the Selective Install
 process and during device driver installations.  
 
 <<=NOTE=>>  Because this driver is used by the Selective Install
 process, it should not be deleted.

DEVICE=C:\OS2\PMDD.SYS
DEVICE=C:\OS2\BOOT\PMDD.SYS     <---- In Warp
 
 OS/2 loads and uses this driver to provide pointer draw support 
 along with POINTDD.SYS.
 
 <<=WARNING=>>  OS/2 will not start without this line in your 
 config.sys file.

BUFFERS=30
 
 Tells OS/2 how many disk buffers to set aside.  Range is from 3  
 to 100.  Each buffer takes up to 512 bytes of RAM.  The install
 default usually works well.  If you are using HPFS only, see
 <<=Tip=>> below.
 
 Disk buffers are blocks of memory set aside by OS/2 for use in 
 reading and writing blocks of data.  For example, if a program
 wants to change 80 bytes of a file, it needs to read the 512
 byte sector that contains the original data, change the infor-
 mation and then write the corrected 512 byte sector back out.
 A "buffer" is the 512 byte temporary staging area for this
 partial sector operation.  According to a source at IBM, "OS/2
 allows multiple simultaneous I/O operations to be queued up for
 both diskette and hard disk.  Each 'concurrent' operation may
 need a buffer.  If there are not enough buffers, overlap can be
 inhibited.  Because OS/2 has more 'simultaneous' queued I/O
 than DOS, it needs more buffers."  
 
 <<=TIP=>>  Generally, you can speed up your system by increasing
 the number of BUFFERS.  But, keep in mind that as you increase
 the number, you reduce available memory.  Be careful about using
 a lower number unless you only have 4MB of RAM.  With 4MB of RAM
 you may wish to set BUFFERS to 20.  
 
 <<=TIP=>>  If you are using only HPFS (i.e., no FAT partitions),
 try setting BUFFERS to 3.  With HPFS you generally don't need
 BUFFERS.  Remember that 3 is the minimum parameter.  If you set
 BUFFERS to 1 or 2, OS/2 will default to 30 since 1 and 2 are out
 of range.  There is one exception to this tip.  If you access
 your floppy disks a lot, then a reduced BUFFERS setting could
 impact floppy performance.

IOPL=YES
 
 When set to YES, this command lets programs that need to bypass
 OS/2 (and its device drivers) and work directly with hardware
 devices, to do so.  One example is Lotus 123/G.  YES means
 that all programs can access the hardware directly.  NO means
 that no program can access the hardware directly.  YES is the
 default and is generally best, since its hard for most of us to
 know when a program is written is such a way as to need direct
 access to hardware.
 
 IOPL stands for Input/Output Privilege Level.
 
 <<=TIP=>>  You can also specify a list of programs that are
 allowed to work directly with the hardware.  For example, 
 IOPL=WS.EXE,123.EXE would allow only these two programs to
 access hardware directly.

RUN=C:\OS2\CACHE.EXE /MAXAGE:2500
 
 This line runs CACHE.EXE which allows you to modify the
 parameters for the HPFS cache.  CACHE.EXE is only used for
 HPFS partitions.  (The DISKCACHE command sets up a cache for
 FAT.)  There are four switches for CACHE.EXE:
 
   /LAZY:  Determines if lazy writes is ON or OFF, that is, 
     whether the contents of the cache will be written to your 
     hard disk immediately (/LAZY:OFF) or when your hard disk 
     is idle (/LAZY:ON).  The default is ON.  I like lazy 
     writes ON because it improves performance, but keep in 
     mind that since the system delays writing data to your 
     hard disk, you can lose data if your system should crash.
     In the config.sys file line above no switch is specified 
     therefore the default remains in effect, which is ON.  
 
     <<=TIP=>>  Lazy writes can also be turned ON or OFF at an 
     OS/2 command prompt.
 
     <<=WARNING=>>  If you include the /LAZY switch, then the 
     CACHE statement will IGNORE ALL OTHER SWITCHES in the 
     line.  Therefore, if you want to turn lazy writes off (or
     on) and also change some other parameter, you will need 
     two RUN statements.
 
     <<=WARNING=>>  There is a bug in OS/2 version 2.1 which
     does not appear to have been fixed in Warp.  You
     can't turn lazy writes off from the config.sys file.  The
     WpS always turns lazy writes ON when it loads regardless
     of what your CACHE.EXE command sets.  So, if you want lazy
     writes off, you will need to run the CACHE command AFTER
     the WpS starts.  Create a CMD file to turn it off and place
     it in your Startup folder.  The WpS has already done it's
     thing when the objects in the Startup folder are opened.
     You can also turn it off from a command prompt.  (Thanks
     to Denis Tonn for this critical information).
 
   /MAXAGE:  Sets how long data waits in the cache before it is 
     moved to another area of the cache where less used 
     information is stored, or how long data waits in the 
     cache before it is written to the hard disk.  It is 
     expressed in milliseconds.  The default is 5,000 or about 
     5 seconds.  In the config.sys file line above, the wait 
     is set at 2,500 milliseconds or about 2 1/2 seconds.
      
   /DISKIDLE:  Sets how long your hard disk must be idle before
     it will accept data from the cache.  Express in 
     milliseconds and the default is 1,000 or about one 
     second.  In the config.sys file line above no switch was
     specified so the default remains in effect.
 
   /BUFFERIDLE:  Sets how long the cache buffer must be idle 
     before its contents MUST be written to your hard disk.  
     Express in milliseconds and the default is 500 or about 
     1/2 second.  In the config.sys file line above no switch 
     was specified so the default remains in effect.
 
 According to one source at IBM, there are two other
 undocumented parameters.  
 
   /DIRTYMAX:  The threshold number of dirty buffers before 
     immediately flushing of least recently used (LRU) data 
     blocks.
 
   /WRITECACHE:  The threshold number of bytes that HPFS will 
     cache for a lazy write.
 
 <<=NOTE=>>  The HPFS IFS config.sys file line sets up the
 cache and uses the system defaults.  This config.sys file
 line is only used to modify the cache parameters.  
 
 <<=TIP=>>  You can check to see what parameters the HPFS cache
 is currently set at by going to an OS/2 command prompt and 
 keying in the word CACHE and pressing the enter key.
 
 <<=TIP=>>  Table 2.0 contains information on optimum settings
 for each of the main parameters.  This great stuff was 
 provided by Proportional Software based upon a great deal of
 OS/2 system tweaking done by the DCF/2 development team.

DISKCACHE=256,LW,32,AC:C
 
 If you are using one or more FAT partitions on a hard drive,
 this command sets up a disk cache for those partitions.  The
 DISKCACHE line noted here sets up a 256k cache.  The default
 cache size used by OS/2 during installation is based on how
 much RAM your system contains.  See Table 3.0.  The minimum
 cache size is 64k and the Maximum FAT cache size is 14MB.

 <<=IMPORTANT NOTE=>>  Under Warp, during installation the 
 letter "D" (for Default?) is used instead of the usual numeric
 value.  This is either an error or an undocumented parameter.
 On the "nets", several users have reported that their disk I/O
 was significantly reduced when they replaced the "D" with a
 a value as was the case in OS/2 2.x.  I suggest you change
 this setting based on the optimum cache sizes as shown in
 Table 1.1 above.
 
 <<=NOTE=>>  This command is for hard drives only.  DISKCACHE
 does not cache FAT based floppy drives.
 
 <<=TIP=>>  If you have the RAM, increase the size to improve
 system performance, but don't get carried away by using to much
 of your RAM; this can hurt performance.  See the information on
 optimum cache sizes contained in Table 1.1 above.
 
 <<=TIP=>>  If you are only using HPFS, then you should REM
 this statement and save 64k of RAM (don't delete, you may need
 or want it later).  If you have a FAT partition on your hard
 drive and you REM this statement, OS/2 will automatically set
 up a 64k cache by default.
 
 ========================= Table 3.0 ===========================
 
 If you have formatted your hard drive(s) with only FAT partitions,
 the default cache size in this statement will be that noted under
 ONE FILE SYSTEM.  If you have both FAT and HPFS partitions,
 then OS/2 defaults to the cache size noted under TWO FILE SYSTEM.
 The file system which uses the greatest amount of your disk space
 gets the larger default value.  
 
   MEMORY SIZE IN MB      TWO FILE SYSTEM       ONE FILE SYSTEM

 ===============================================================
 
 LW:  Enables lazy writes.  If you don't want lazy write enabled,
 then ",LW".
 
 32:  Sets the threshold size.  It is express in number of sectors
 which are 512 bytes each.  Data requests from your disk that are
 larger than this number will not be cached.  The default is 4.
 Thirty two (32) is said to be an optimum number.  One hundred 
 twenty eight (128) is the maximum allowable.  This setting has
 no impact on RAM.
 
 AC:C:  If you want CHKDSK to automatically check your start
 up partition (usually C), then add this switch to end of the
 DISKCACHE command:  AC:n where n is your start up partition,
 e.g. AC:C.

MAXWAIT=3
 
 This command sets the longest period a program will have 
 to wait to execute before OS/2 ups its priority.  This makes
 sure that no program is put on hold forever while some other
 program hogs the system.  You can set MAXWAIT from 1 to 255
 seconds.  The default is 3 seconds.  
 
 <<=TIP=>>  When running heavy background programs, such as a
 BBS, change the setting to 1, i.e. MAXWAIT=1.  This will keep
 the BBS software or other background programs running at top
 speed.  For general use, it appears that setting MAXWAIT=2
 makes the system a little livelier.
 
 <<=NOTE=>>  MAXWAIT only has an effect if PRIORITY=DYNAMIC.

MEMMAN=SWAP,PROTECT
 
 OS/2 can run more programs and use more data than can actually
 be stored in memory at any given time.  This is done by swapping
 large amounts of memory to your hard disk and then reading the
 data back into memory when needed.  This is called virtual memory.
 For example, if you have 4MB of memory you will see lots of disk
 activity while you are working with your system.  A lot of this is
 OS/2 swapping memory to and from your hard disk.  Lots of memory
 swapping slows down your system and can cause your hard disk to
 fragment quicker than normal.
 
 The MEMMAN command controls the swap process.  The syntax is 
 MEMMAN=s,m,PROTECT,COMMIT where s=SWAP or NOSWAP; m=MOVE or NOMOVE.
 The default is to have virtual memory on.  To turn off virtual 
 memory, which is NOT recommended, the config.sys file line should 
 read:  MEMMAN=NOSWAP.  See <<=CAUTION=>> below.
 
 PROTECT allows the allocation and use of protected memory.  Unless
 you are a programmer who needs this set to NOPROTECT, leave the 
 default.
 
 <<=NEW 2.1+ PARAMETER=>>  A new parameter with version 2.1 is COMMIT.
 With this parameter included, OS/2 will allocate space in the swap 
 file whenever a program commits memory.  Increase your SWAPPER.DAT 
 file (in the SWAPPATH line below) by the amount of memory you are 
 likely to use when using the COMMIT parameter.
 
 <<=TIP=>>  You can also use the COMMIT parameter another way.  
 Without COMMIT set, the minimum free noted in you SWAPPATH
 specified the point at which OS/2 gives you a message warning that
 your disk space is running low.  When you set COMMIT, the minimum
 free value noted in your SWAPPATH statement becomes the amount of
 hard disk space that will always remain free on the swap file
 partition.  Thus, with COMMIT set, you can never run out of disk
 space on your swap file partition. 
 
 <<=CAUTION=>>  When messing with the MEMMAN line, I changed it to
 MEMMAN=NOSWAP.  As a result, I had to boot from my OS/2 installa-
 tion disk and recover my backup config.sys file to get the system
 to boot.  According to Blake Stover, "The reason MEMMAN=NOSWAP,
 PROTECT chokes is because of the hat tricks OS/2 does while
 loading the WpS, Desktop, Bitmaps, Folders, Cache buffers, MMPM/2,
 etc..  OS/2 likes to load all of these, then swap or discard the
 inactive code.  If there is no where to swap to it dies during
 boot, unable to initialize the resources it needs.  NOSWAP,PROTECT
 should only be used for boots from floppy to do maintenance, in
 most cases.  (People who use TSHELL on a machine with a good
 amount of RAM may also use it to speed operations).
 
 <<=NOTE=>>  The MOVE/NOMOVE parameter is only provided for
 OS/2 1.x compatibility.
 
 <<=NOTE=>>  NOPACK PARAMETER.  When OS/2 initially loads a 16-bit
 OS/2 application, it packs the segments into pages and copies
 them to the swap file for faster recovery when needed.  This can
 be disabled by using the NOPACK option on the MEMMAN line. How-
 ever, the performance decrease and larger working set will rarely

SWAPPATH=C:\OS2\SYSTEM 512 4096
   
 OS/2 can allocate more memory than it actually has available. 
 It does this by swapping memory to a hard disk file called
 SWAPPER.DAT.
 
 The syntax is SWAPPATH=DRIVE,PATH,mmm,nnn where DRIVE,PATH is
 the location where you want the SWAPPER.DAT file to be placed and
 mmm is a number from 512 to 32767 which specifies how large the
 SWAPPER.DAT file can grow before it stops consuming hard disk
 space.  The size is stated in the negative.  In other words, if
 you have the mmm set to 512, then the SWAPPER.DAT file can grow
 until there is only 512k left on your hard disk.  The variable
 nnn is the starting size of the SWAPPER.DAT file.
 
 The install default SWAPPER.DAT size is set based on the amount
 of RAM your system has available as shown in Table 4.0.                   
 
 ============================ Table 4.0 ============================

 ===================================================================
 
 <<=TIP=>>  When your swap file grows beyond the initial size you
 have specified, OS/2 starts to manage the swap file.  This
 increased overhead can negatively impact your systems performance.
 Therefore, if your swap file always exceeds its initial size,
 consider increasing the files initial size.  For example, if your
 swap file usually grows to 8MB, set the initial size of 8MB.
 
 <<=TIP=>>  Normal operation of OS/2 can involves considerable
 disk activity as operating system functions are loaded and pages
 are moved in and out of the swap file.  Here are a couple of tips
 to improve performance.  (1) Consider dedicating a separate
 partition for the swap file.  This helps avoid fragmentation of
 the swap file, because other files will not be added or deleted
 from the dedicated partition.  (2) If you have both FAT and HPFS
 partitions, put the swap file on the HPFS partition to take
 advantage of the better performance of HPFS.  (3) If you have a
 system with two hard disk controllers, put the swap file on a disk
 managed by the least used controller.  (4) Keep your swap file on
 the MOST used partition of the LEAST used hard drive.
 
 <<=WARNING=>>  Never put your swap file on a networked drive.
 
 <<=NOTE=>>  Your swap file will grow (in 1MB increments), but it
 also shrinks when two conditions are met.  One, when the amount
 of free space in the swap file is greater than 1.5MB, the swap
 file will be compressed during system idle time.  (It will not
 shrink if there is a constant "hit" on the drive by a program such
 as a swap file monitor.)  Two, during the compression, free space
 is moved to the end of the swap file.  When this free space at the
 end of the swap file exceeds 1MB, the swap file will be shrunk.
  
 <<=NOTE=>>  See the discussion of the new COMMIT parameter for the 
 MEMMAN config.sys line including the <<=TIP=>>.
 
 <<=WARP NOTE=>>  Your swap file in Warp will be larger than in
 earlier versions of OS/2.  This is normal.  The most significant
 change that has been made is how system DLL's get loaded and what
 is now valid data for swapping.  System DLL's include:  DISPLAY,
 SOM, PMMERGE, PMWP, DOSCALL1, PMATM, PMMLE, IBMDEV32, PMCTLS,
 PMSPL, IBMVGA32, PMGPI, and PMVIOP.
                                                            
 In the previous versions of OS/2, dll code was never copied to
 the swapper file.  In WARP, code for system dll's can be written
 to the swapper file and, in adition, during boot, PMMERGE,
 DOSCALL1, PMGPI, PMWP and PMVIOP will be swapped out.  This
 means that there will be an overall increase in swapper size.
 This was done to increase overall system perfomance.

BREAK=OFF
  
 For DOS programs only.  Many DOS programs can be stopped by
 holding down the Ctrl key and then pressing the Break key. 
 BREAK controls how quickly DOS programs stop when you interrupt
 them with the Ctrl+Break sequence.  If BREAK=OFF, DOS will stop
 the program only when the programs next reads a character from
 the keyboard or writes to the screen or printer.  With BREAK=ON,
 DOS will check for the Ctrl+Break on a more frequent basis. 
 Remember that this extra checking can make your DOS programs run
 slower.

THREADS=256
 
 OS/2 programs can have several different processes running at
 the same time.  These are called threads.  This command sets
 the maximum number of threads, from 32 to 4095, that OS/2 can
 run at the same time.  If this command is not included in your
 config.sys file, OS/2 will default to 64.
 
 <<=TIP=>>  On systems with only 4MB of RAM, set THREADS to 128
 to free up memory.  
 
 <<=TIP=>>  If you have more than 8MB of RAM and run lots of OS/2
 specific programs, you may be able to improve system responsive-
 ness by increasing the number of threads.  Why?  Because well
 written OS/2 programs will use threads to improve program per-
 formance.  Therefore, the more well written OS/2 programs in use,
 the more threads that could be needed.  But still keep in mind
 that this only holds true only when you are using a fair number
 of OS/2 specific programs at the same time.  Even when I opened
 the Enhanced Editor, AmiPro for OS/2, ZOC, and KWQ Mail/2, I was
 only using 57 threads.  The most threads I've ever recorded at
 one time was 62.

PRINTMONBUFSIZE=134,134,134
 
 This command sets the size of the print buffers for your 
 parallel ports.  The syntax is PRINTMONBUFSIZE=LPT1,LPT2,LPT3
 where LPT1 is the buffer size for the parallel port LPT1, LPT2
 is the buffer size for LPT2 and LPT3 is the buffer size for
 LPT3.  The default and minimum is 134 bytes and the maximum is
 2048 bytes.
 
 <<=Note=>>  You must define a buffer for LPT2 and LPT3 even if
 you don't use these ports.  You will get an error message at
 start up if you don't.
 
 <<=TIP=>>  You may be able to improve printer throughput by 
 increasing buffer size.  I have my LPT1 set to 2048.  On systems
 with less than 6MB of RAM, don't increase the size of these
 buffers. 
 
 <<=TRIVIA=>>  Ever wonder where IBM got a parameter like 134? 
 I did and Lynn Nash passed along the following in response to
 my question:
 
 "Obviously you have no background on the big iron or it has 
 disappeared into historical memory :-).
 
 "Mainframe line standard of 132 columns plus 2 for carriage
 return and line feed characters.  That is why all the wide
 carriage dot matrix printers also had 132 column lines, to be
 able to use that wide green bar paper. Anyone that had an early
 Okidata 83 dot matrix even had an electronic format tape, but
 that is a story for another time."

COUNTRY=001,C:\OS2\SYSTEM\COUNTRY.SYS
 
 Customizes your system for the country you wish to use.  It 
 establishes which defaults to use when it comes to decimal 
 separators, date and time formats, currency symbols, etc.  The 
 syntax is COUNTRY=xxx,PATH,FILE NAME.  xxx is a three-digit code 
 number that tells what country to use.  The number is usually
 (but not always) the same as the international telephone dialing
 prefix for the country desired.  Table 5.0 contains various
 country codes.

SET KEYS=ON
 
 When using the command line, KEYS tells CMD.EXE whether to
 remember previous keystrokes so they can be recalled with the
 up arrow key.  OS/2 maintains a 64k buffer for storing
 keystroke history.  KEYS can be ON or OFF.
 
 <<=TIP=>>  On systems with only 4MB of RAM, SET KEYS to OFF,
 you need the memory more than this feature.  Even with 16MB of

 To use OS/2s UNDELETE command, you must first establish a
 directory to store the deleted files.  To do this, create
 a directory called DELETE on each drive you have and then
 remove the "REM" from this config.sys file line.  
 
 This command points OS/2 to the directory you created to place
 deleted files in.  It also indicates the maximum number of
 files that will be stored in the DELETE directory.  If the
 number of deleted files exceeds the maximum number that you
 specified, then files are automatically removed from the
 directory on a first-in-first-out basis.

BASEDEV=PRINT01.SYS
 
 BASEDEV installs a base device driver used by OS/2 when it is first
 started.  The statement cannot contain either a drive or path 
 because OS/2 cannot process such information at the stage at which 
 these statements are process.  These base device drivers include:
 
 PRINT01.SYS supports attached printers on non-Micro Channel PC's.
 PRINT02.SYS supports attached printers on Micro Channel PC's.
 IBM1FLPY.ADD supports diskette drives on non-Micro Channel PC's.
 IBM2FLPY.ADD supports diskette drives on Micro Channel PC's.

 OS2ASPI.DMD Adaptec ASPI support.
 HITCDS1.FLT supports Hitachi CDR-1750.
 SBCD2.ADD supports Panasonic CD-ROM drives.
 LMS206.ADD supports Philips CD-ROM drives.
  
 <<=TIP=>>  Try adding the following switches to the
 BASEDEV=IBM1S506.ADD line: BASEDEV=IBM1S506.ADD /A:0 /U:O /SMS,
 and use /V (/V=verbose) to see if the /SMS works.  This will
 improve performacne on those IDE drives that support the SMS
 feature.  It will not work on all IDE drives, but it will not
 damage anything either.
 
 <<=TIP=>>  If you wish to prevent users from using the
 floppy drives under OS/2 (to keep them from loading non-
 authorized programs or in a workstation situation), REM the 
 BASEDEV=IBMxFLPY.ADD line (where x is 1 for ISA and EISA
 machines, or 2 for Microchannel).
 
 <<=NOTE=>>  In Warp, the install program may have placed both
 IBM1FLPY.ADD and IBM2FLPY.ADD BASEDEV drivers in your 
 config.sys.  Remove IBM2FLPY.ADD if you don't have a Micro
 Channel PC.
 
 <<=WARP TIP=>>  With Warp, the default transmission protocal use
 by PRINTO1.SYS and PRINTO2.SYS is the polling transmission
 method.  The protocal used by previous versions of OS/2 was the
 interrupt transmission method.  In Warp, you can change back
 to the interrupt method by adding the /IRQ switch.

PROTECTONLY=NO
 
 Allows you to choose between a shared DOS and OS/2 operating
 environment or just an OS/2 environment.  If you plan to run
 only OS/2 programs, then set PROTECTONLY=YES.  If you plan to
 run DOS programs (including Windows), then set PROTECTONLY=NO.
 
 <<=NOTE=>>  Jonathan de Boyne Pollard relayed the following:
 "Part of the difficulty of talking about OS/2 2.x, as opposed
 to OS/2 1.x, is that *all* processes run in *protected mode*.
 The 386 never runs in real mode in OS/2 2.x.
 
 "Virtual DOS Machines are run in v8086 mode, which is still
 *protected mode*, as the paging mechanism is still active.
 The major difference between v8086 and normal protected mode
 is that the segment base addresses in linear memory are
 fixed, instead of being determined by the entries for each
 selector in the LDT and GDT.
 
 "So PROTECTONLY in OS/2 2.x means *don't use v8086 protected
 mode*. For a while there we thought that it meant *don't use
 real mode* and so was useless to OS/2 2.x, but it seems after
 all that it retains its original OS/2 1.x semantics, if not 
 its original mechanism."

SHELL=C:\OS2\MDOS\COMMAND.COM C:\OS2\MDOS /P
 
 This line identifies and loads the DOS command processor
 COMMAND.COM which you must have to make DOS sessions work.  The
 /p switch keeps the command processor in memory until shut down.
 
 <<=NOTE=>>  This is the line where you can also specify the size
 of the DOS environment variable.  The range is 160 through 32768.
 For example, to set a 1024 byte environment you would add the
 following to the end of the SHELL command line:  /E:1024
 
 <<=TIP=>>  You can also load and run other command processor's
 such as 4DOS.  To do so, just put 4DOS in your MDOS directory
 and change the SHELL line to read 4DOS.COM instead of
 COMMAND.COM.

FCBS=16,8
 
 File Control Blocks (FCBS) are an outmoded holdover from old 
 versions of DOS.  The blocks are an internal holding area for
 data about concurrently open files.  In newer versions of DOS,
 these FCBS have been replaced by File Handles, but some DOS
 programs still use them and you need this statement for com-
 patibility.  The command tells an OS/2 VDM how many FCBS can
 be open at once, or, when DOS needs to open more FCBS than are
 available, how many currently open but not active FCBS may be
 closed to make room for new ones.
 
 The syntax is FCBS=a,b where a=the number of FCBS that DOS can
 have open at one time and b=the number of FCBS DOS cannot close
 to make room for new FCBS.  "a" can be as high as 255.  "b" can
 have a value of 0 to 254, but must be less than "a".  Unless
 you get some kind of error message when running a DOS program
 that tells you the program doesn't have enough FCBS, leave the
 default as set.
 
 <<=TIP=>>  You may wish to experiment with a smaller number.
 If you can get by with a smaller number, you will get back a
 little memory in each of your DOS sessions.  My suggestions is
 that you set it to 4,2.  If you make this change and then load
 a DOS program that says it can't open a file, increase the
 first value, reboot, and see if the error message goes away.
 You can also increase or change the value in the DOS programs
 Settings notebook.

RMSIZE=640
 
 This is a DOS command and sets the amount of memory available
 for use by each DOS session.  The maximum is 640k.  Since some
 DOS programs require 640k, its best to have RMSIZE set to 640.
 
 <<=TIP=>>  If you only have 4MB of RAM or don't have any DOS 
 programs that need a full 640k, you should consider reducing
 this parameter to 512.  Many DOS applications will run in a
 512k DOS partition.  Doing this will free up some additional
 RAM which will help performance.  Remember that Windows is
 a DOS program.  I don't suggest you attempt to run it in less
 than 640kb.
 
 <<=TIP=>>  If you need maximum memory (more than 640k), see
 tip under DOS=LOW,NOUMB.

DEVICE=C:\OS2\MDOS\VEMM.SYS 
 
 VEMM.SYS lets DOS programs use expanded memory unless you
 override it by changing a DOS programs SETTINGS.
 
 Three of its switches are:
 
   /S=n  Sets the limit of EMS memory in blocks of 1024k.  
      Default is 2.
 
   /L=n  Size of conventional memory that can be remapped.  
      Default is none.
 
   /F=nnnn  Memory frame address to be used to map EMS.  
      Default is AUTO.
 
 <<=NOTE=>>  Settings you specify in a DOS session will
 override these switches.
 
 <<=NOTE=>>  The VEMM.SYS device must be listed in your
 config.sys file before the VXMS.SYS device.

DEVICE=C:\OS2\MDOS\VMOUSE.SYS 
 
 Identifies and loads the mouse driver to let you use a mouse
 with DOS.  Mouse support for OS/2 is loaded below.  
 
 <<=NOTE=>>  If you don't have this line (or you REM'd it), you
 will not have mouse support in your DOS sessions.

DOS=LOW,NOUMB
  
 This is a standard DOS command that lets you control how DOS
 uses memory.  The default is DOS=LOW,NOUMB and is considered
 by many to be the best setting for it conserves memory
 for OS/2.  DOS=HIGH (including ,UMB) reduces available memory
 for OS/2, but increases the available memory in EVERY DOS
 session.  Few DOS sessions need maximum memory.  Also remember
 that you can move DOS HIGH for a specific program by changing
 that programs Settings.  This is done in the programs Settings
 Notebook and is likely the better way to go.  Finally, keep in
 mind that in OS/2 many device drivers are not taking up room in
 your 640k DOS area.  So you generally have more memory in the
 typical OS/2 DOS session than in a standard DOS session.
 
 The following is the amount of memory my system reports in each
 DOS session with DOS=LOW,NOUMB.  The vast majority of all DOS
 programs will run just fine with this amount of memory.
 
   655360 bytes total memory
   655360 bytes available for DOS
   618208 largest executable program size    <---- About 604k.
 
 With DOS=HIGH, the amount of memory reported is:
 
   655360 bytes total memory
   655360 bytes available for DOS
   643632 largest executable program size    <---- About 629k.
 
 <<=TIP=>>  If you need the maximum available RAM in a DOS
 session and can get by on CGA or MONO, in the DOS Settings of
 your applications Settings Notebook, change VIDEO_MODE_RESTRICTION
 to CGA or MONO.  (Note that there are some reports from users
 that this procedure does not work on their hardware.)  A final
 note:  For this to work on some systems, you may need to change
 RMSIZE command to 639 (RMSIZE=639).  See description of this
 parameter above.  This is the result of a bug in OS/2.  

 The amount of memory reported after doing this on my machine is:
 
   752640 bytes total memory
   752640 bytes available for DOS
   740656 largest executable program size    <---- About 724k.

 This OS/2 command is needed if you have a CD-ROM.  It installs 
 CDFS.INF which is the "Installable File System" for CD-ROMs. 
 Your CD-ROM is not going to run without it.
    
 <<=TIP=>> You can add cache to your CD-ROM IFS by adding the
 /C:n switch.  The variable "n" is a number which represents
 units of 64kb of memory.  For example, /C:4 would set up a
 256kb cache (4 x 64kb = 256kb).

DEVICE=C:\OS2\MOUSE.SYS SERIAL=COM1 QSIZE=10
DEVICE=C:\OS2\BOOT\MOUSE.SYS SERIAL=COM1 QSIZE=10  <-- In Warp
 
 Lets you use a mouse or track ball.  This line also identifies
 the type of mouse you have and which COM port it is on.  QSIZE
 is a number from 1 to 100 which indicates how many mouse
 actions are to be saved when you execute mouse actions
 faster than your system can handle them.  There is also a 
 RELAXED parameter which you would place after QSIZE.  It can
 be used with any mouse when the pointer is jumping randomly
 about the screen.  IBM does not suggest you use this parameter
 unless you are experiencing this problem.
 
 <<=NOTE=>> The MOUSE.SYS statement must come before COM.SYS
 because COM.SYS will take over any unused COM port.  If COM.SYS 
 takes over the COM ports before MOUSE.SYS is loaded, MOUSE.SYS
 will not have any COM ports available, thus no mouse support.

DEVICE=C:\OS2\COM.SYS
DEVICE=C:\OS2\BOOT\COM.SYS        <---- In Warp
 
 Lets you use the communications ports COM1 and COM2.  If you

 see <<=TIP=>> below.  This line MUST appear after any driver
 that uses a communications port.  Use COM02.SYS for IBM PS/2
 model 90 and 95.
 
 <<=TIP=>> There are two very good replacement drivers for 
 COM.SYS\VCOM.SYS called SIO.SYS\VSIO.SYS.  It can be obtained
 on most OS/2 BBSs.  If you utilize communications software on a
 regular basis at high speeds (e.g. 14,400), I recommend you 
 consider SIO.SYS.  Replace VCOM.SYS with VSIO.SYS which
 comes with SIO.SYS.  SIO.SYS and VSIO.SYS are Shareware, not 
 Freeware.  Register them if you use them!
 
 <<=TIP=>> To add support for COM3 and COM4 at location 3E8 with
 IRQ 4 and 2E8 with IRQ 3 respectively, add (3,3E8,4) (4,2E8,3)
 to the DEVICE line, e.g. DEVICE=C:\OS2\COM.SYS (3,3E8,4)

 OS/2 sessions have ANSI support by default.  If you are unsure
 if ANSI is on or off in an OS/2 session, go to an OS/2 command
 prompt and type ANSI.  You will get a message like:  "ANSI

DEVICE=C:\OS2\TOUCH.SYS
 
 (From OS/2s online documentation)
 
 Implements support for touch devices.  For a touch device to be
 effectively used, the POINTDD.SYS device driver and appropriate
 mouse device-driver support must be loaded. In addition, these
 statements must be included in the CONFIG.SYS file in the
 following order: 
 
 o  A device-dependent statement that gives the name of the
    file containing the information for the touch device you use. 
 
 o  A device-independent statement that identifies the touch
    device to TOUCH.SYS
  
 If during installation, OS/2 detects a touch device installed on
 your system, the Install program automatically loads the required
 device-driver support necessary to enable the touch device.  The
 touch device shares the auxiliary device (mouse) port on the
 system with the mouse by allowing the mouse to connect to the 
 touch device, which is then connected to the system. 
 
 The Install program automatically adds the following statements
 to the CONFIG.SYS file: 
 
 DEVICE=C:\OS2\PDITOU0x.SYS CODE=C:\OS2TOUCO21.BIN INIT=C:TOUCH.INI
 DEVICE=C:\OS2\TOUCH.SYS TYPE=PDITOU$
 RUN=C:\OS2\CALIBRATE.EXE-C C:\OS2CALIBRAT.DAT
 DEVICE=C:\OS2\MOUSE.SYS TYPE=PDIMOU$
  
 "x" is 1 or 2 depending on the bus architecture of your system.
 TOUCO21D.BIN is the touch-device microcode binary file and
 TOUCH.INI is a text file containing default parameter settings.
 
 The RUN=CALIBRAT.EXE statement is to activate the Calibration
 program.  This program performs the dual actions of downloading
 calibration-constant data to the touch device each time the
 system is started, and enabling recalibration of the touch
 device at initial setup, and when the device is moved to a new
 location. 
 
 To recalibrate the touch device, enter the following at an OS/2
 command prompt: 
 
  x:           (where "x" is your OS/2 boot drive.)
  CD \OS2
  CALIBRAT -U

 See DEVICE=C:\OS2\TOUCH.SYS

DEVICE=C:\OS2\LOG.SYS
 
 This optional device driver installs OS/2s error log file.  If
 you want a log of errors that occur on your system, then add
 this and the next line to your config.sys file.  If you are
 interested in such things, you may wish to play with it, but
 be forewarned, the error log information is cryptic and
 incomplete.  See note below.  To learn what these codes mean,
 you need to have IBMs Systems Network Architecture Formats
 (GA27-3136-12) or, for a reasonable overview, get OS/2 2.1
 Unleashed, 1993, SAMS Publishing.
 
 The switch /E:nn sets the size of the error log buffer.  The
 range is from 4kb to 64kb with 8kb as the default.  
 
 You will get a short and quick message during boot up
 indicating that Logging has been installed and what the buffer
 size is.
 
 <<=NOTE=>> LOG.SYS has its limitations.  It will not log an 
 application error unless the application has be written to make 
 use of LOG.SYS.  Some routine system errors will not log either 
 because OS/2 opens an error message box on screen to report
 these.

RUN=C:\OS2\SYSTEM\LOGDAEM.EXE /E:C:\OS2\LOGFILE.DAT /W:16
 
 This RUN command starts the logging process and must appear
 AFTER you have installed the LOG.SYS driver noted in the 
 config.sys line above.  The two switches are:
 
  /E:path\filename  This is the path and file name of the
     test file where the errors will be logged.  You can place 
     it anywhere you want and call it anything you wish.  
     NOTE:  Like the OS/2 INI files, this file is "locked" and 
     you will not be able to access it with your standard text 
     editor or the OS/2 System Editor.  You will get a 
     "violation error".  The Enhanced Editor will open the file.
 
  /W:nn  This is the size of the file named with the /E
     switch.  The default size is 64k, but with this switch 
     you can set the value from 4k to 64k.  I've set the file 
     size at 16k in the example line above.
 
 <<=NOTE=>> Use SYSLOG.EXE from an OS/2 command line prompt to
 view your log file.

CODEPAGE=437,850
 
 Lets you use the alphabet of various countries and languages.
 The syntax is CODEPAGE=ppp,sss, where ppp is the number of the
 primary national alphabet to be used and sss is a secondary 
 alphabet number.  From an OS/2 command line, you can use the
 CHCP command to switch between these two code pages.  This can
 be useful in order to type, display or print data in a
 different language from the version installed.  CHCP can be
 used either without a parameter to query the current code
 page, or with one parameter in order to switch between primary
 and secondary code pages.  CHCP cannot be used to change to a
 code page not defined in the CODEPAGE= config.sys line.  
 
 437=US English alphabet and 850=multinational alphabet.  The 
 multinational alphabet contains most of the accented letters 
 used in various European languages.  Several other alphabets
 that can be supported by your version of OS/2.  See Table 6.0.  
 
 <<=WARNING=>> Japan, Korean and Chinese require a special 
 version of OS/2 and special hardware.

 <<=WARNING=>> The choice of code page is made at installation
 time and should only be changed by using Selective Install. 
 
 <<=NOTE=>> If there is not a CODEPAGE statement in your
 config.sys, your keyboard will use an alphabet based on
 the COUNTRY statement found earlier in your config.sys,
 but your screen and printer will use their built in defaults.

DEVICE=C:\OS2\VDISK.SYS 512
 
 As in DOS, this driver installs a RAM disk.  In this example,
 the RAM disk is 512k with the sectors and directories parameters
 set at the default level (64-byte sectors and 64 directory
 entries).  With DOS, a RAM disk could significantly improve
 system performance, but because OS/2 handles your memory far
 more efficiently than DOS and has its own sophisticated caching
 routines, using a RAM disk is not recommended.  
 
 <<=CAUTION=>> Because a RAM disk takes available memory away
 from OS/2, you may negatively impact system performance on
 systems with less than 12MB of RAM.  Unless you have lots of
 RAM or have a very specific need, don't install a RAM disk.
 
 <<=NOTE=>> If you do install VDISK.SYS and you also have 
 EXTDSKDD.SYS installed, VDISK.SYS much be placed after
 EXTDSKDD.SYS in your config.sys file.  Check your on-line

 There is no reason for it to be added to your config.sys

5.  NOVELL NETWARE NETWORK SUPPORT.                                  

 Novell's NetWare is the most popular PC Network software around 
 today.  We use it at work and I've used our config.sys file
 entries as the basis for this section of information.   
 
 <<=NOTE=>> I'm not very knowledgeable about networks, so if
 someone would like to expand on this information and send it to
 me, I'd love to give you credit and include it here.

REM --- NetWare Requester statements BEGIN ---

DEVICE=C:\NETWARE\LSL.SYS
   
 Loads Link support Layer driver.  It is the lowest layer in
 the Novell Open Data Link Interface model and is required at
 all times for the requester to be active.

RUN=C:\NETWARE\DDAEMON.EXE
 
 A daemon is a background process that usually carries out 
 administrative tasks for the system without you knowing it. 
 This "daemon" is required for the requester to be active.

DEVICE=C:\NETWARE\TOKEN.SYS
 
 This line differs depending on the network board you have.

DEVICE=C:\NETWARE\ROUTE.SYS
 
 No information available.

DEVICE=C:\NETWARE\IPX.SYS
 
 Provides Novell IPX protocol support and is required for
 access to a NetWare server.

DEVICE=C:\NETWARE\SPX.SYS
 
 Provides Novell SPX protocol support.  It is my understanding
 that this command is required for some Novell printing
 utilities, but is optional in most cases.

RUN=C:\NETWARE\SPDAEMON.EXE
 
 Loads a daemon process that handles SPX packets.

REM DEVICE=C:\NETWARE\NMPIPE.SYS
 
 Loads the support for client-only Named Pipes support.

REM DEVICE=C:\NETWARE\NPSERVER.SYS
 
 Loads support for your workstation to function as a Named
 Pipes server.

REM RUN=C:\NETWARE\NPDAEMON.EXE NP_COMPUTERNAME
 
 This line is required for either the client or the server
 NetBIOS support to be active and is a daemon program that is
 part of the Named Pipes support.

DEVICE=C:\NETWARE\NWREQ.SYS
 
 This is the CORE REQUESTER MODULE.  This line must follow any
 lines that support IPX, SPX, or Named Pipes.

IFS=C:\NETWARE\NWIFS.IFS
 
 This installed the networks Installable File System.  This IFS
 enables OS/2 to see the network drives just the same as local 
 drives.

RUN=C:\NETWARE\NWDAEMON.EXE
 
 Another daemon program, but I'm not sure for which process.

DEVICE=C:\NETWARE\NETBIOS.SYS
 
 Loads support for the NETBIOS protocol.

RUN=C:\NETWARE\NBDAEMON.EXE
 
 Loads the NETBIOS daemon process.

DEVICE=C:\NETWARE\VIPX.SYS
 
 Loads support for multiple virtual DOS machine support.  It is 
 required both to have multiple DOS boxes on the network and to
 run the NetWare DOS based utilities.

DEVICE=C:\NETWARE\VSHELL.SYS
 
 Loads the network shell.  It is automatically used for all DOS
 and WIN-OS/2 sessions that require it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
6.  OBSCURE CONFIG.SYS SETTINGS. 

 What follows are some very obscure config.sys settings.  They
 are here only for informational purposes.  Unless you have a
 very specific need and know what you're doing, please don't
 experiment with these.

SET SHELLEXCEPTIONHANDLER=OFF
                            
 The WpS has its own exception handling routines which allow it
 to recover from most errors, but when programming your own
 objects, you want to see all errors as they occur.  You can turn
 WpS "exception handling" off with this command.  Could be useful
 when debugging a Workplace Shell object.

SET OBJECTSNOOZETIME=45                                  
 
 Useful when programming certain types of object DLLs.  The
 default setting for the snooze time is 90 seconds.  Unless you
 are programming your own Workplace Shell objects, you should
 not change the default setting.

SET SHAPIEXCEPTIONHANDLER=OFF                     
 
 This command disables the WpS API exception handler, and all
 WpS exceptions are handled by OS/2.

SET VIDEO_APERTURE=xxx
 
 This command allows you to set the address for video memory
 refresh buffers, where xxx is a hexadecimal number.

SUPPRESSPOPUPS=x
 
 Use SUPRESSPOPUPS to suppress the popup box display of trap
 information messages and logs the trap information to the
 file POPUPLOG.OS2 in the root directory of the drive specified
 by "x".
  
 <<=NOTE=>> The log file name cannot be overridden.

REIPL=ON
 
 This command automatically restarts the system when a system
 trap or internal processing error occurs.  Parameter is ON or
 OFF.  Default is OFF.
  
TIMESLICE=128,256
 
 This command allows you to manually control the minimum and
 maximum amount of processor time any thread can receive at
 once.  The syntax is TIMESLICE=x,y where x is the minimum time
 slice (in milliseconds and must be at least 32) and where y is
 the maximum length (must be less than 65536).
 
 <<=TIP=>> OS/2 handles time slicing dynamically.  This means
 that the system is adjusting the time slice values based on
 the actual processes active on the system as the workload
 changes.  Therefore, it is best not to attempt to manually
 set TIMESLICE.  OS/2 can handle this process far better than
 most of us can.

TRACE=ON
 
 The system trace facility is used to record a sequence of
 system events, function calls, or data.  The record is usually
 produced for program debugging purposes.  After the trace data
 is recorded, the System Trace Formatter is used to retrieve it
 from the system trace buffer (see TRACEBUF below) and format
 the data to either your display, printer, or to a file.  Start
 tracking system problems by turning TRACE on which will
 establish a 4KB default buffer.  (You can increase this using
 the command TRACEBUF) to store tracing data.  You can also
 start TRACE from an OS/2 command prompt.
 
 <<=NOTE=>> You can turn TRACE=ON and then set TRACE=OFF for
 major or minor codes.  For example, TRACE=OFF 24,50,98. 

TRACEBUF=x
 
 This command sets the size of the trace buffer.  If any valid
 TRACE statement is in your config.sys, the default size of
 the trace buffer will be 4KB.  You can modify this size with
 the TRACEBUF command.  Maximum size is 63KB.  "x" is a specific
 number from 1 to 63, representing a multiple of 1024 bytes.

TRAPDUMP=xx,d
 
 Parameters are:  OFF,drive letter
                  ON,drive letter
                  R0,drive letter
 
 Indicates when a stand alone dump is to be taken and where the
 dump is to be placed.  The default value is OFF and the default
 drive is "A".
 
 If you are sending a memory dump to hard disk, you must first
 create a FAT partition labeled SADUMP and give it a size
 greater than the amount of physical memory in your system.
 The drive you specify in the TRAPDUMP statement must contain
 the SADUMP partition.  Any existing data in this partition
 will be overwritten.  The system will restart after the TRAPDUMP
 process has been completed.
 
 <<=NOTE=>> If REIPL=ON is specified in the config.sys file, the
 system will restart automatically and no dump will be taken when
 a system trap or internal processing error occurs.
 
 Luca Regoli, Societa' Italiana Autori Editori, provides the
 following information on this command.
 
 "This way whenever a trap occurs you don't get anything on the 
 screen.  The PC beeps and [responds] as if you had depressed
 CTRL+ALT+NUMLOCK / NUMLOCK.
 
 "Not very useful though I don't know how to get traps infor-
 mation from the dump disk (and don't want to download all 20Mb
 dump of memory any time I get a trap)."

DUMPPROCESS=x
 
 Activates the Dump Process.  Any application process that traps
 will cause a process dump.  The information will be written to
 a dump file named PDUMP.xxx where xxx is an index that is
 incremented each time a new process dump is created.  This dump
 file resides in the root directory of drive specified in "x".    
                                                                       
PROTECT16                                                            
 
 Haven't found out about this one yet.  Comments?

8.  HOW TO RESTORE A DAMAGED CONFIG.SYS FILE FROM A BACKUP COPY.
 
 1.  Boot OS/2 from the OS/2 Installation Disk.
 
 2.  Insert OS/2 Disk #1 when asked.
 
 3.  Press the ESC key when you get the first text screen.  By
     doing this you will be put into OS/2s command line mode.
 
 4.  Assuming that your backup copy of config.sys is in the root 
     directory of "C" drive and is named CONFIG.SAV, enter the 
     following command:
 
     COPY C:\CONFIG.SAV C:\CONFIG.SYS
 
     Press the ENTER key.
 
 5.  Remove OS/2 Disk #1 and reboot the system.
 
 What if you didn't make a backup copy?  IBM thought about you. 
 When OS/2 was first installed on your system, the installation
 program made a backup copy of your original config.sys file. 
 It stored this file in C:\OS2\INSTALL.  To restore from this
 file follow the same steps above, EXCEPT, in step #4 enter the
 following command instead of the one shown:
 
   COPY C:\OS2\INSTALL\CONFIG.SYS C:\CONFIG.SYS
   
 <<=TIP=>> Replace the config.sys file saved by the OS/2
 installation program in the INSTALL directory with your most
 current version, thus allowing you to restore from it.  If you
 are viewing this information using CNFGINFO.EXE, the Backup
 option is set to do this for you.
 
 <<=NOTE=>> In OS/2 Warp, IBM provides an archive feature which
 can be activated by opening your Desktop settings, click on the
 Archive Tab, and then click on "Create archive at every system
 restart".  With this feature activated, you can simply press
 Alt+F1 at boot and be presented with a menu which will allow you
 to boot with an alternate (backup) config.sys file.  See your
 user documentation for details.

9.  REXX SUPPORT FROM WITHIN THE CONFIG.SYS FILE.
 
 The question of whether REXX programs can be called from within
 the config.sys file has been asked by a number of people.  Keith
 Medcalf's response to the question is one of the best I've seen.  
 Thanks Keith!

 You cannot.  The DLLs required to support Rexx are not loaded
 until Presentation Manager is loaded.  If you require Rexx
 support earlier, look for a program call SRVREXX at a fine BBS
 near you.
 
 Adding the line RUN=SRVREXX.EXE to the config.sys will
 immediately initialize Rexx.  You will then be able to access
 Rexx with or without PM being loaded.
