Introduction
------------
While doing non-stop development for Osrm2 I decided it would be good
to take a break and do something different for a weekend.

As a mainframe babyboomer I had experience with the VM flavor
of Rexx ( 4-5 years ago! ) and was somewhat familiar with the nature of
the puppy. This re-visit soon made me realize there is more under
the hood then I considered during my first encounter.

So DevShell was, and is being, created as an educational vehicle as well.

The goal is to create an easy to understand, powerful, reconfigurable,
and fun developers shell using OS/2's Rexx. Version 1.0 of DevShell is
what I have been able to do up to this point ( 12.07.1991 ).

Before you pass judgement on it, enhance it! Like I said, I am just 
picking it up again and I KNOW it is rusty, even potentially buggy in
a few areas. But if you feel the need to comment to me, I can be
reached at the above places at various points of the 24 hour day.

DevShell        
--------
DevShell is an enhanced command enviroment geared towards the 
developer. It is completely ( even the on-line help ) written in Rexx so
it can be modified to suit the users own ideas and needs.

DevShell builds its personality by definitions in the configuration
file (Dshell.Cfg). Within this file are application, volume, and
alias executable assignments that reduce the need for knowing every
file, directory, compiler name, etc.

The real power, at this release, is the alias EXEC statements which
can indirectly reference applications (cl,make,link,etc...) with
one (1) command. 

With the EXEC command you can even extend the shell to call other
Rexx '.CMD' files. 

Help
----
Forget it. You have the source, you have the online help system, you
have the configuration file, look at it! It is very straight foward and
a basic programmer could pick it up overnight, and soon find themselves
enhancing it.
