MkBkObj utility V0.01

(C) 1994 by Ralf G. R. Bergs <rabe@pool.informatik.rwth-aachen.de>
Released as "Freeware"


This is a simple, but nevertheless quite useful REXX script that can
be used to create program objects for .INF and other documentation files
in a simple manner.

To use it, install it by starting the INSTALL.CMD script. When asked,
enter the destination directory (without leading backslash, e.g.
"g:\tools") and press return. This copies MkBkObj.CMD to the desti-
nation directory and creates a program object for it on your desktop.

Whenever you want to create a program object for one or several
.INF or other doc files, you just drag the files from your drives
object to the "Make Book Object" icon.
".INF" files get installed with VIEW.EXE as their viewer app, all
other files get E.EXE as viewer app.

Note: you should check the "Start minimized" checkbox of your
"Make Book Object" icon to prevent the script's OS/2 window from
opening. I couldn't find any info how to do that in the install
script. *** Any info on this is greatly appreciated. ***

This is released as "Freeware" in the hope that this may be useful.
However, no warranty whatsoever is given. If it kills your cat,
bad luck. :-)
