dosmap21.zip    unix->dos directory/file name transform [perl]

This is a perl script to take a unix hierarchy structure, and transform it
into a dos compliant one.  This means that unix filenames will get changed
to dos-compliant ones, AND that references in (uncompressed) files will also
get changed to reflect those name changes.  For example, makefiles and
header files will automatically be updated.  Obviously there is no magic way
of knowing exactly when a string in a file is a filename as opposed to just
some string, so there is the possibility for errors.  However, I have found
this utility very useful in converting complex program directory structures
automatically.

This latest version allows you to make a history file of the conversion, so
that the converted form can be "unconverted".  This is useful if, like me,
you sometimes work at home on a DOS box and want to take a take hierarchy
home, work on it, and bring it back.

USAGE:

	 dosmap.prl [-i -h <history>]<source hierarchy> <result>

This maps the source hierarchy to a DOS compliant version in <result>.
The "-i" flag allows for interactive name changing, i.e., the script prompts
you with its suggestion, you hit <CR> to accept it, and anything else to
replace it.  In the case where two files map into the same name, the program
reports an error and terminates.  This is not optimal and I hope later to
change this behaviour.

The -h <history> option stores a history of changes made in the file
<history>.  This file can be used to un-transform the mapped hierarchy back
into the Unix version. This is done by:

      dosmap.prl -u -h <history> <mapped hierarchy> <unmap to here>
