VIEW 9.7a - HOW DO I?
=====================

Q.  I have a text file for which the line wrap is not what I want.  It
    wraps at column 76 and I want it to wrap at column 64.  Can VIEW
    handle this for me?

A.  Yes.  If the file is WordPerfect, Word or any other wordprocessing file
    you must first convert it to ASCII by pressing F6 and choosing "Save
    as" at VIEW's menu.  Suppose you save the file as "myfile.doc",
    then from the file selection menu press F2 and set your required line
    wrap, then make sure you toggle F3 so that the message "ASCII line wrap on"
    appears above the list of files.  Then select myfile.doc to view.  If
    it appears the way you want it, press F6 and chooses "Save as" again.
    You can give it the same name or a different one.

                     ====================================


Q.  I obtained a file from a UNIX server.  It contains accented characters,
    but they don't look right. Can VIEW help me?

A.  Yes.  UNIX files use the ANSI character set and DOS uses the ASCII set.
    To convert all you need to do is press F10 while viewing the file, then
    F6 to save it in its converted form.

                     ====================================


Q.  I have a Windows Notepad file containing accented characters, but they
    don't look right. What can I do?

A.  See the answer to the previous question.  Notepad also uses the ANSI
    character set.

                     ====================================


Q.  I have a document containing accented characters that I want to send to
    a UNIX server. Can I translate the characters to UNIX (ANSI) format?

A.  Yes - just press Shift-F10 while viewing the file, then press F6 and
    choose "Save as").  To convert the saved file further, use the utility
    dos-unix, which is provided to those who register VIEW.  This
    utility converts from the DOS line feed format to the UNIX format.

                     ====================================

Q.  I want to do a text search in a lot of files.  Do I have to load them
    individually in VIEW?

A.  No.  Suppose you want to find the word "California".  All you need do
    is type view *.* California.  Then the text search function will be on
    for all files you view.  To find each occurrence of California, keep
    pressing F2. To switch the text search function off, press F4.

                     ====================================

Q.  Can I convert from one word processor format to another?

A.  No, VIEW converts to ASCII (or ANSI).  However, using the "save for
    word processor" (F4 at the print menu), you can save a file in a format
    that your word processor should be able to import without a hard return
    at the end of every line.
