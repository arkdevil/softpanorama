PROBLEMS WITH VIEW 9.7a?
========================================================================

PROBLEM: You try to print a file via JETCOL or 2COL but nothing happens -
         the display just returns to the VIEW screen.

POSSIBLE REASONS:

1. You don't have JETCOL or 2COL!

2. You have JETCOL or 2COL, but you have not left enough memory free for it
to run.  Go to the configuration program VW97CFG.COM and reconfigure
VIEW to have at least 50 memory blocks reserved.  You may get away
with 49, you may need 51 - experiment!  ALTERNATIVELY: re-run VIEW
using the /mem command line switch to allocate (temporarily) more memory
for JETCOL/2COL.

3.  You have JETCOL or 2COL, and you have enough memory allocated for it,
but it is not referenced in your PATH statement.  Either edit your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file to put the drive and directory where you keep JETCOL or
2COL in the path, or, from VIEW, enter the full path when asked to enter
your command line parameters.

========================================================================


PROBLEM: VIEW behaves in a strange fashion - keys don't work, or the
display is garbled.

POSSIBLE REASONS:

1. The VIEW.EXE file has become damaged. Re-install from the ZIP file.

2. You have not allocated enough memory blocks. The configuration program
allows you to go as low as 8, but that may not be enough. Try increasing
the memory allocation units reserved until VIEW works properly.  The
number may depend on how much memory you have installed on your system,
what TSRs you have running, whether or not not you are running under a network, for
example. I find that allocating 13 units allows VIEW to run without
problems.

3.  You have configured VIEW for fast display but you have an
incompatible video card (this is more and more unlikely unless you
have an old card, or a card in an AT&T or Olivetti machine).
Reconfigure VIEW to disable fast video.

4.  You see "snow" on the screen.  This means you have configured
for fast video but your video card is just not fast enough to keep
up with the display (this happens with CGA cards).  Reconfigure VIEW
to disable fast video display.

========================================================================

PROBLEM: VIEW does not properly decode Word for Windows 6 files.

REASON:  I have developed an algorithm for decoding WinWord 6 files, but
         these files are very complex. Please report any problems you have.

========================================================================

PROBLEM: I am running VIEW on a 132 column screen but the menu display
         does not properly clear when I exit the menu.

REASON:  As shipped, VIEW is "hard wired" not to try to detect what
         display parameters you are using (i.e.  rows and columns).  This is
         because there are some video cards that apparently do not use standard
         means for reporting their current mode.  Configure VIEW,
         using the configuration program, to use "fast video".  In this
         mode, VIEW does query your video card to get its current
         display mode.


=========================================================================

PROBLEM: I saved a file in the "save for word processor" format, but my
         word processor will not import it, or says "unknown format".

REASON:  Not all word processors will import files that are not in their
         own format.  If you see the "unknown format" message, try editing
         the file you are trying to import using an ASCII editor such as
         BOXER.  Put a few lines of garbage, with hard returns, at the
         beginning of the file.  Your word processor should now recognize it
         as an ASCII file and import it.  You can then delete the lines of
         garbage.

=========================================================================

PROBLEM: I saved a file in the "save for word processor" format but when I
         import it there are gaps in the lines.

REASON: Unfortunately, there is not much you can do about this, because it
        means that the original file had spaces at the beginning of lines.

        Note for registered users:
         Try saving the file to ASCII format (if it is not already an ASCII
         file), then converting it with the utility STRIPIT, which is
         included in the package sent to registered users.  STRIPT removes
         blanks and tabs from the beginning and end of lines.
