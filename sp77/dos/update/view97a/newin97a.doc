                                Recent history

VIEW Version 9.4
================
         Enhanced the 132 column mode by adding "emulated" 132 column
         display.  In this, if you are running 80 columns on screen, 132
         columns of text are available for viewing on each line by using
         the left and right cursor arrow keys.  This feature allows you to
         print documents with more than 80 columns (for example, program
         listings) without forced line wraps.  It also provides
         compatibility with a new feature in the registered version of
         JETCOL 3.3 (print in landscape mode).  As before, the actual
         column at which line wrap occurs can be reset on the fly from the
         file selection menu.


VIEW Version 9.5
================
         Added functions to print or convert a file directly without first
         viewing it.  Added functions for setting basic HP and
         HP-compatible printer modes (portrait and landscape, normal and
         compressed print) for those printers that recognize the PCL4
         command set.  Added ability to define column width (from 20
         to 132 characters) for display.

         NOTE: please read the documentation file.  The /132 and /132m
               switches introduced in version 9.4 have been replaced by
               /wnnn and /xnnn (where nnn is a three digit number between
               020 and 132).

VIEW Version 9.6
================

Added ability to convert between ASCII and ANSI character sets.  This
enables you to view Windows NOTEPAD files and others that use the ANSI
character set for high order characters (e.g.  é, â, ô).  Conversion from
ANSI can be toggled from the file menu or on the fly while a file is being
viewed.  Conversion to ANSI can be done on the fly.  NOTE: this has meant
that the function key F10, formerly used on the view screen menu for exiting
the menu, has been changed to space bar; F10 and Shift-F10 are now used for
the ASCII-ANSI conversions.  Changed the "show memory parameters" key on
the file list screen from ?  to m, for compatibility with European and other
non-US keyboards. Added a user-definable command for initializing printer.

VIEW Version 9.7
================

Improved the display of ASCII files when the line wrap is set by VIEW
rather than using carriage returns in the file being viewed (i.e.  when F3
is pressed at the file selection menu to toggle ASCII line wrap ON).  You
can use this feature for reformatting ASCII files - e.g. to change the
line width.

Added support for viewing Windows clipboard text files (i.e. files saved
as CLP files from the clipboard).

Improved the display of Compuserve mail and message files

Added a feature to enable you to save files in a special ASCII format
suitable for importing into word processors without a hard return at the
end of each line.

Added a link to the external program HLP2DOC, which translates Windows help
files to a format that VIEW can read.

Improved the command line options.  The /mem switch is replaced with a
/mnnn switch, where nnn is a three digit number that allows you to
temporarily override the default setting for allocating memory blocks.  The
/xnnn switch is therefore no longer needed.  Also, the order of switches is
no longer important.


VIEW Version 9.7a
=================

Added bookmark function, including automatic setting of bookmarks when VIEW
reads ASCII files that contain form feeds.  Added a function to go to text
currently at top of display (useful for reading contents and going directly
to appropriate section).  file.  Added a /a command line switch to enable
automatic translation of ANSI files (such as produced by Windows Notepad)
to ASCII.
