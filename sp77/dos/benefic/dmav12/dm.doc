     Purpose
     -------
     maven (MAY vin) n. expert or connoisseur, devotee.

     Directory Maven is DOS utility program that allows the user to
     quickly change to another directory across any drive (quick mode
     option) or to view the directory structure of all drives in a
     graphical tree format (tree mode option).

     License
     -------
     Directory Maven is Freeware, i.e. copyrighted software that may be
     freely distributed and used indefinitely without payment to the
     author.  The only restrictions that apply are that the program
     files must be distributed together and unmodified, including the
     documentation files.  This software is provided as is and without
     warranty.  The author assumes no liability for damages, either
     direct or consequential, which may result from the use of this
     product.

     Installation
     ------------
     Copy DM.EXE into one of your path directories so that it can be
     executed from any directory.  Type PATH at the DOS command line to
     see a list of your path directories, each separated by a ";".
     Edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to modify your PATH.

     DMCONFIG
     --------
     If you have a monochrome monitor, you may need to run DMCONFIG.EXE
     to change the screen colors from the default color setting to
     black and white colors only.  DMCONFIG will modify DM.EXE with
     the new color settings.

     Scan File
     ---------
     Directory Maven scans the directories on your drives and stores
     this list in a file called DM.DAT.  By default, DM.DAT will be
     stored in the same directory as DM.EXE.  However, this will cause
     problems if DM.EXE is on a network drive and being shared by many
     users.  Therefore, Directory Maven will first look for a DOS
     environment variable called DIRMAVEN that points to the location of
     DM.DAT.  Use the SET command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to define an
     environment variable (e.g. SET DIRMAVEN=C:\GLOBAL).  If this
     variable does not exist then Directory Maven looks for a one-line
     ASCII text file called DM.CFG in the same directory as DM.EXE.
     DM.CFG will specify the location of DM.DAT.  To create a DM.CFG
     file that specifies C:\ as the DM.DAT directory, type the following
     lines at the DOS command line:

     COPY CON DM.CFG <Enter>
     C:\ <Enter>
     <Ctrl-Z> <Enter>

     Finally, if DM.CFG does not exist, then Directory Maven stores
     DM.DAT in the same directory as DM.EXE.

     First Time Operation
     --------------------
     Start Directory Maven by typing DM at the DOS command line and
     press Enter.  Press F2.  Type in the letters representing the
     drives you want scanned.  Your active drives are shown in black in
     the upper left corner of the screen.  Normally, you would not scan
     removable media drives such as floppy or CD-ROM drives, although
     you can if you want to.  Press Enter to scan the drives and create
     the DM.DAT scan file.  After scanning, press Esc or Alt-X to exit
     Directory Maven.

     Quick Mode Operation
     --------------------
     Use the command line options to operate Directory Maven in
     Quick Mode.  Type DM ? to see all the possible parameters.  The
     parameters are not case sensitive.

     To quickly change to another directory (even if it is on another
     drive) enter one of the following commands at the DOS prompt:

     DM partial_directory_name
     DM *partial_directory_name

     where partial_directory_name could be something like "my" when
     you want to change to a directory that starts with "my" such as
     "C:\LOTUS\MYFILES".  Precede the name with an "*" to find matches
     within the directory name.  For example, "DM file" would not find
     "C:\LOTUS\MYFILES" but "DM *file" would.

     Directory Maven will look in DM.DAT for exact and partial matches
     to "file".  If only one match is found, then Directory Maven will
     change to that directory and exit.  If more than one match is
     found, a pop-up list will be displayed showing all matches.  Exact
     matches will be shown at the top of the list followed by partial
     matches.  Cursor to the one you want and press Enter or press Esc
     to cancel.  Up to 999 matches will appear in the list.  Matches on
     inactive drives (e.g. network drives when not logged in) will not
     be shown.

     If you want to restrict the search to one specific drive, then
     prefix the directory name with a drive letter and colon:

     DM d:partial_directory_name
     DM d:*partial_directory_name

     Scanning Drives
     ---------------
     To add new drives or update previously scanned drives in the
     DM.DAT file, use the following commands:

     DM /sD
     DM /s+D

     where D is the drive list.  For example, DM /sCGK will scan drives
     C, G, and K.  Prefix the drive list with a "+" to include hidden
     directories.  Drives previously scanned, but not scanned this
     time will remain in the scan file unchanged.  You may also scan
     drives in Tree Mode (see below).
     
     Adding New Directories To Scan File
     -----------------------------------
     To add a single directory to the DM.DAT scan file without
     rescanning the entire drive, change to the new directory using the
     DOS CD command and use the Add switch:

     DM /a

     The parent directory of the new directory must already exist in
     the scan file or the add operation will fail.

     Tree Mode Operation
     -------------------
     Run Directory Maven in Tree Mode to see a graphical tree
     representation of your drives.  Start DM without any command line
     parameters to run in Tree Mode.  Your active drives are shown in
     black in the upper left corner of the screen.  Previously scanned
     drives that are currently inactive are shown lower case in gray.
     Examples of inactive drives might include network drives when you
     are logged out of the network, RAM drives and CD-ROM drives when the
     drivers were not loaded during this session, etc.  The 43/50 line
     EGA/VGA modes are supported in Tree Mode.  Use the DOS Mode command
     to set the number of display lines.  Example: MODE CON LINES=50

     Directory Tree Navigation
     -------------------------
     The directory tree for the current drive will be displayed on start
     up.  The current directory will be shown in yellow (if previously
     scanned).  Use the cursor keys, PageUp/PageDn, and Home/End keys to
     move through the tree.  Hold the shift key down when using the
     up/down arrow keys to stay in the same tree level.  Press the left
     arrow key to move to the parent of the current directory.  When the
     root directory is highlighted, the date and time the drive was last
     scanned is shown on the bottom status line.  Use the Tab and Shift-Tab
     keys to move to other drives.  Press F1 to display the help screen.

     Speed Search
     ------------
     To move quickly to a directory (current drive only) in tree mode,
     begin typing the characters in the name.  The cursor will jump to
     the next match found with each keystroke.  The computer will beep
     if no match is found.  Press Alt-N during Speed Search to look for
     other matches based on the characters you typed in so far.  Press
     Esc or any of the cursor keys to exit Speed Search.  Use the
     backspace key to erase the last Speed Search character.

     Scanning Drives
     ---------------
     Press F2 to rescan one or more drives.  If you want to include
     hidden directories, press Shift-F2 instead.  Type in the letters
     representing the drives to scan.  Press Enter to start or Esc to
     cancel.  Only the active drives (shown in black in the upper left
     corner) can be scanned, up to 999 directories each (memory
     permitting).  Drives previously scanned, but not scanned this
     time will remain in the scan file unchanged.  You may also scan
     drives from the DOS command line (see above).

     Removing Drives and Directories
     -------------------------------
     To remove a single directory from the scan file, move the cursor
     to the directory and press Delete.  You cannot remove a directory
     if it has subdirectories (unless you remove the subdirectories
     first).  To remove a drive from the scan file (including inactive
     drives), make that drive current using the Tab or Shift-Tab keys,
     and press Shift-Delete.  Note: these commands only remove the
     directories from the DM.DAT scan file, they do not erase files or
     directories from your hard drive.

     Printing
     --------
     Press Alt-P to print the directory tree for the current drive.
     The following prompt will appear:

     Print tree to LPT (1,2,3):

     Press "1" to print to LPT1, "2" for LPT2, etc.  Press Esc to
     cancel printing.  Make sure your printer is set up to print
     extended ASCII characters.  For most HP laser printers, the symbol
     set needed is "PC-8".

     Exit Directory Maven
     --------------------
     Press Enter to change to the drive/directory highlighted and exit
     Directory Maven.  Press Esc or Alt-X to exit Directory Maven
     without changing directories.
