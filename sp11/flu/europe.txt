        register  your  usage  of FLU_SHOT+ locally than to  register  it 
        "across  the puddle",  please feel free to do so by sending  your 
        completed registration form,  along with your registration fee of 
        US$14  (US$10 Registration, US$4 Shipping and Handling) to:


                       Mr. Josef Kirschbaum
                       Kirschbaum Software, GMBH
                       Kronau 15
                       8091 Emmering, West Germany

        Kirschbaum  Software  is an authorized distributor  of  FLU_SHOT+, 
        kept upto date with the latest version of FLU_SHOT+.    They will 
        process  your check for us,  and will then forward a copy of  the 
        latest version,  avoiding the typical delays experienced by  some 
        of our European users in the past.

        If  you do opt to register with us directly,  please be  sure  to 
        include your payment in US funds, payable on a US bank.  Just for 
        your  information,  processing a European check in a US bank  can 
        take upto six weeks and costs about US$25!
