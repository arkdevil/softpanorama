                   ===============================================

        FLU_SHOT+ is a successful anti-virus product, affording its users 
        very sophisticated protection methods and techniques. However, to 
        give some users additional protections and an easier method of 
        implementing these protections required some thought on our part.

        We're pleased to announce a new program -- a program with its 
        heritage in FLU_SHOT+. But we go a lot further from there.

        Many of the comments on the registration form for FLU_SHOT+ indicated 
        that our program, as far as it went, did not go far enough with 
        regard to the data security and anti-virus needs of the corporate 
        community. FLU_SHOT++ offers substantially more virus protection and 
        data security.

        Along with a good, on-line help facility, one which tells you what 
        each trigger means, and what to do about it. FLU_SHOT++ allows you to 
        scan your entire hard disk, reporting infections of viruses it knows 
        about, and offers a means to automatically remove these virus 
        infections. And, there were plenty of requests to allow for an 
        unlimited number of files to be protected via our checksum method.

        Additional security enhancements allowing for the corporate MIS 
        director to permit only authorized programs to be able to be run on 
        your system. Password protection of certain directories, the ability 
        to prevent unauthorized copying of files off the system, adequate 
        logging of FLU_SHOT triggers and attempted security breaches. 
        Data encryption. Disk Disaster recovery. Special LAN facilities. 
        And a bunch more.  And, yes, a manual that has been cleaned up a 
        bit and made suitable for even the most sensitive of tastes.

        Well, we listened to what people wanted - we are user driven, after 
        all. And we're pleased to announce the availability of a product 
        which takes off where FLU_SHOT+, good as it is, leaves off.

        FLU_SHOT++ has all of the protection of FLU_SHOT+, along with the 
        additional enhancements mentioned above. It's a commercially 
        distributed product, available in computer stores near you. And it's 
        available directly via mail order, too: fill out the below form and 
        we'll get a copy to you straight away.

        I'm pleased to say that HJC Software, a well known software and anti-
        virus software company over in the Mac  world (they're the 
        publishers of the well known VIREX anti-virus package) was so 
        impressed when they saw the capabilities and strengths of FLU_SHOT++ 
        that they bought all distribution rights to the product.  That means 
        that, as weird as it sounds, I'm not allowed to sell you FLU_SHOT++ 
        directly.  HJC Software has exclusive rights to FLU_SHOT++ in all 
        English versions, worldwide.  They'll be able to provide you with 
        technical support and other services a small company like mine really 
        can't.  I'll continue to update FLU_SHOT++ and will continue to 
        provide HJC with the kind of technical support support they need so 
        they can provide you with the technical support you need.

        Thanks for your continued support!

        Sincerely, Ross M. Greenberg
        Author, FLU_SHOT+  (and now, FLU_SHOT++!)
