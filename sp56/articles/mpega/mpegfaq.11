Subject: [71] Introduction to MPEG (long)


Written by Mark Adler <madler@cco.caltech.edu>.

Q. What is MPEG?
A. MPEG is a group of people that meet under ISO (the International
   Standards Organization) to generate standards for digital video
   (sequences of images in time) and audio compression.  In particular,
   they define a compressed bit stream, which implicitly defines a
   decompressor.  However, the compression algorithms are up to the
   individual manufacturers, and that is where proprietary advantage
   is obtained within the scope of a publicly available international
   standard.  MPEG meets roughly four times a year for roughly a week
   each time.  In between meetings, a great deal of work is done by
   the members, so it doesn't all happen at the meetings.  The work
   is organized and planned at the meetings.

Q. So what does MPEG stand for?
A. Moving Pictures Experts Group.

Q. Does it have anything to do with JPEG?
A. Well, it sounds the same, and they are part of the same subcommittee
   of ISO along with JBIG and MHEG, and they usually meet at the same
   place at the same time.  However, they are different sets of people
   with few or no common individual members, and they have different
   charters and requirements.  JPEG is for still image compression.

Q. Then what's JBIG and MHEG?
A. Sorry I mentioned them. Ok, I'll simply say that JBIG is for binary
   image compression (like faxes), and MHEG is for multi-media data
   standards (like integrating stills, video, audio, text, etc.).
   For an introduction to JBIG, see question 74 below.

Q. Ok, I'll stick to MPEG.  What has MPEG accomplished?
A. So far (as of January 1992), they have completed the "Committee
   Draft" of MPEG phase I, colloquially called MPEG I.  It defines
   a bit stream for compressed video and audio optimized to fit into
   a bandwidth (data rate) of 1.5 Mbits/s.  This rate is special
   because it is the data rate of (uncompressed) audio CD's and DAT's.
   The draft is in three parts, video, audio, and systems, where the
   last part gives the integration of the audio and video streams
   with the proper timestamping to allow synchronization of the two.
   They have also gotten well into MPEG phase II, whose task is to
   define a bitstream for video and audio coded at around 3 to 10
   Mbits/s.

Q. So how does MPEG I work?
A. First off, it starts with a relatively low resolution video
   sequence (possibly decimated from the original) of about 352 by
   240 frames by 30 frames/s (US--different numbers for Europe),
   but original high (CD) quality audio.  The images are in color,
   but converted to YUV space, and the two chrominance channels
   (U and V) are decimated further to 176 by 120 pixels.  It turns
   out that you can get away with a lot less resolution in those
   channels and not notice it, at least in "natural" (not computer
   generated) images.

   The basic scheme is to predict motion from frame to frame in the
   temporal direction, and then to use DCT's (discrete cosine
   transforms) to organize the redundancy in the spatial directions.
   The DCT's are done on 8x8 blocks, and the motion prediction is
   done in the luminance (Y) channel on 16x16 blocks.  In other words,
   given the 16x16 block in the current frame that you are trying to
   code, you look for a close match to that block in a previous or
   future frame (there are backward prediction modes where later
   frames are sent first to allow interpolating between frames).
   The DCT coefficients (of either the actual data, or the difference
   between this block and the close match) are "quantized", which
   means that you divide them by some value to drop bits off the
   bottom end.  Hopefully, many of the coefficients will then end up
   being zero.  The quantization can change for every "macroblock"
   (a macroblock is 16x16 of Y and the corresponding 8x8's in both
   U and V).  The results of all of this, which include the DCT
   coefficients, the motion vectors, and the quantization parameters
   (and other stuff) is Huffman coded using fixed tables.  The DCT
   coefficients have a special Huffman table that is "two-dimensional"
   in that one code specifies a run-length of zeros and the non-zero
   value that ended the run.  Also, the motion vectors and the DC
   DCT components are DPCM (subtracted from the last one) coded.

Q. So is each frame predicted from the last frame?
A. No.  The scheme is a little more complicated than that.  There are
   three types of coded frames.  There are "I" or intra frames.  They
   are simply a frame coded as a still image, not using any past
   history.  You have to start somewhere.  Then there are "P" or
   predicted frames.  They are predicted from the most recently
   reconstructed I or P frame.  (I'm describing this from the point
   of view of the decompressor.)  Each macroblock in a P frame can
   either come with a vector and difference DCT coefficients for a
   close match in the last I or P, or it can just be "intra" coded
   (like in the I frames) if there was no good match.

   Lastly, there are "B" or bidirectional frames.  They are predicted
   from the closest two I or P frames, one in the past and one in the
   future.  You search for matching blocks in those frames, and try
   three different things to see which works best.  (Now I have the
   point of view of the compressor, just to confuse you.)  You try using
   the forward vector, the backward vector, and you try averaging the
   two blocks from the future and past frames, and subtracting that from
   the block being coded.  If none of those work well, you can intra-
   code the block.

   The sequence of decoded frames usually goes like:

   IBBPBBPBBPBBIBBPBBPB...

   Where there are 12 frames from I to I (for US and Japan anyway.)
   This is based on a random access requirement that you need a
   starting point at least once every 0.4 seconds or so.  The ratio
   of P's to B's is based on experience.

   Of course, for the decoder to work, you have to send that first
   P *before* the first two B's, so the compressed data stream ends
   up looking like:

   0xx312645...

   where those are frame numbers.  xx might be nothing (if this is
   the true starting point), or it might be the B's of frames -2 and
   -1 if we're in the middle of the stream somewhere.

   You have to decode the I, then decode the P, keep both of those
   in memory, and then decode the two B's.  You probably display the
   I while you're decoding the P, and display the B's as you're
   decoding them, and then display the P as you're decoding the next
   P, and so on.

Q. You've got to be kidding.
A. No, really!

Q. Hmm.  Where did they get 352x240?
A. That derives from the CCIR-601 digital television standard which
   is used by professional digital video equipment.  It is (in the US)
   720 by 243 by 60 fields (not frames) per second, where the fields
   are interlaced when displayed.  (It is important to note though
   that fields are actually acquired and displayed a 60th of a second
   apart.)  The chrominance channels are 360 by 243 by 60 fields a
   second, again interlaced.  This degree of chrominance decimation
   (2:1 in the horizontal direction) is called 4:2:2.  The source
   input format for MPEG I, called SIF, is CCIR-601 decimated by 2:1
   in the horizontal direction, 2:1 in the time direction, and an
   additional 2:1 in the chrominance vertical direction.  And some
   lines are cut off to make sure things divide by 8 or 16 where
   needed.

Q. What if I'm in Europe?
A. For 50 Hz display standards (PAL, SECAM) change the number of lines
   in a field from 243 or 240 to 288, and change the display rate to
   50 fields/s or 25 frames/s.  Similarly, change the 120 lines in
   the decimated chrominance channels to 144 lines.  Since 288*50 is
   exactly equal to 240*60, the two formats have the same source data
   rate.

Q. You didn't mention anything about the audio compression.
A. Oh, right.  Well, I don't know as much about the audio compression.
   Basically they use very carefully developed psychoacoustic models
   derived from experiments with the best obtainable listeners to
   pick out pieces of the sound that you can't hear.  There are what
   are called "masking" effects where, for example, a large component
   at one frequency will prevent you from hearing lower energy parts
   at nearby frequencies, where the relative energy vs. frequency
   that is masked is described by some empirical curve.  There are
   similar temporal masking effects, as well as some more complicated
   interactions where a temporal effect can unmask a frequency, and
   vice-versa.

   The sound is broken up into spectral chunks with a hybrid scheme
   that combines sine transforms with subband transforms, and the
   psychoacoustic model written in terms of those chunks.  Whatever
   can be removed or reduced in precision is, and the remainder is
   sent.  It's a little more complicated than that, since the bits
   have to be allocated across the bands.  And, of course, what is
   sent is entropy coded.

Q. So how much does it compress?
A. As I mentioned before, audio CD data rates are about 1.5 Mbits/s.
   You can compress the same stereo program down to 256 Kbits/s with
   no loss in discernable quality.  (So they say.  For the most part
   it's true, but every once in a while a weird thing might happen
   that you'll notice.  However the effect is very small, and it takes
   a listener trained to notice these particular types of effects.)
   That's about 6:1 compression.  So, a CD MPEG I stream would have
   about 1.25 MBits/s left for video.  The number I usually see though
   is 1.15 MBits/s (maybe you need the rest for the system data
   stream).  You can then calculate the video compression ratio from
   the numbers here to be about 26:1.  If you step back and think
   about that, it's little short of a miracle.  Of course, it's lossy
   compression, but it can be pretty hard sometimes to see the loss,
   if you're comparing the SIF original to the SIF decompressed.  There
   is, however, a very noticeable loss if you're coming from CCIR-601
   and have to decimate to SIF, but that's another matter.  I'm not
   counting that in the 26:1.

   The standard also provides for other bit rates ranging from 32Kbits/s
   for a single channel, up to 448 Kbits/s for stereo.

Q. What's phase II?
A. As I said, there is a considerable loss of quality in going from
   CCIR-601 to SIF resolution.  For entertainment video, it's simply
   not acceptable.  You want to use more bits and code all or almost
   all the CCIR-601 data.  From subjective testing at the Japan
   meeting in November 1991, it seems that 4 MBits/s can give very
   good quality compared to the original CCIR-601 material.  The
   objective of phase II is to define a bit stream optimized for these
   resolutions and bit rates.

Q. Why not just scale up what you're doing with MPEG I?
A. The main difficulty is the interlacing.  The simplest way to extend
   MPEG I to interlaced material is to put the fields together into
   frames (720x486x30/s).  This results in bad motion artifacts that
   stem from the fact that moving objects are in different places
   in the two fields, and so don't line up in the frames.  Compressing
   and decompressing without taking that into account somehow tends to
   muddle the objects in the two different fields.

   The other thing you might try is to code the even and odd field
   streams separately.  This avoids the motion artifacts, but as you
   might imagine, doesn't get very good compression since you are not
   using the redundancy between the even and odd fields where there
   is not much motion (which is typically most of image).

   Or you can code it as a single stream of fields.  Or you can
   interpolate lines.  Or, etc. etc.  There are many things you can
   try, and the point of MPEG II is to figure out what works well.
   MPEG II is not limited to consider only derivations of MPEG I.
   There were several non-MPEG I-like schemes in the competition in
   November, and some aspects of those algorithms may or may not
   make it into the final standard for entertainment video compression.

Q. So what works?
A. Basically, derivations of MPEG I worked quite well, with one that
   used wavelet subband coding instead of DCT's that also worked very
   well.  Also among the worked-very-well's was a scheme that did not
   use B frames at all, just I and P's.  All of them, except maybe one,
   did some sort of adaptive frame/field coding, where a decision is
   made on a macroblock basis as to whether to code that one as one
   frame macroblock or as two field macroblocks.  Some other aspects
   are how to code I-frames--some suggest predicting the even field
   from the odd field.  Or you can predict evens from evens and odds
   or odds from evens and odds or any field from any other field, etc.

Q. So what works?
A. Ok, we're not really sure what works best yet.  The next step is
   to define a "test model" to start from, that incorporates most of
   the salient features of the worked-very-well proposals in a
   simple way.  Then experiments will be done on that test model,
   making a mod at a time, and seeing what makes it better and what
   makes it worse.  Example experiments are, B's or no B's, DCT vs.
   wavelets, various field prediction modes, etc.  The requirements,
   such as implementation cost, quality, random access, etc. will all
   feed into this process as well.

Q. When will all this be finished?
A. I don't know.  I'd have to hope in about a year or less.

Q. How do I join MPEG?
A. You don't join MPEG.  You have to participate in ISO as part of a
   national delegation.  How you get to be part of the national
   delegation is up to each nation.  I only know the U.S., where you
   have to attend the corresponding ANSI meetings to be able to
   attend the ISO meetings.  Your company or institution has to be
   willing to sink some bucks into travel since, naturally, these
   meetings are held all over the world.  (For example, Paris,
   Santa Clara, Kurihama Japan, Singapore, Haifa Israel, Rio de
   Janeiro, London, etc.)

Q. Well, then how do I get the documents, like the MPEG I draft?
A. MPEG is a draft ISO standard. It's exact name is ISO CD 11172.
   The draft consists of three parts: System, Video, and Audio. The
   System part (11172-1) deals with synchronization and multiplexing
   of audio-visual information, while the Video (11172-2) and Audio
   part (11172-3) address the video and the audio compression techniques
   respectively.

It is available for a price of 699.-DM inclusive 14 %  VAT.

Here comes the technical info about the new moviegrabber(tm)
PC-Hurricane(tm):

It is a hicolor color YUV (4:1:1) realtime video movie digitizer which can
store 25 frames/sec(PAL) or 30 frames/sec(NTSC)  into Expanded Memory. It
has support for ET4000 Hicolor and true color boards.

The software is a userfriendly DOS software, which displays the incoming
video signal in almost realtime (about 5-10 frames/sec) on a ET4000 Hicolor
board in 32768 colors/pixel. This is okay for video purposes, cause the
noise inside a video movie almost does already the dithering to a true
color quality (simualar to 24 bit quality).

If you don't have a Hicolor card inside your PC, then there is also a 256
color version driver, which displays the video signal in almost realtime
in 3-3-2 color quantisation (still the TGA pics are saved as 16 bit
Hicolor/pixel, so quality from the saved output is the same as in the
Hicolor software driver).

If the sequence arrives, which you wanna digitize, just hit the space key.
Then it is digitized into the Expanded Memory in realtime with 25 or 30
frames/sec maximum rate. This can be adjusted to 12.5 or 8 or 4 frames/sec!
During this storing process, you will not see any signal on your VGA
monitor, but if the RAM is filled with e.g.396 frames at 320x240, then you
can already watch the digitized movie play of the Expanded Memory!

It plays in slow motion the YUV coded fields to the SVGA card via the ISA
bus. This gives a real slow motion Hicolor digital movie out of the RAM !

So if you have 32 MBytes of Ram on your motherboard, you can be happy.
Then you can store about 16 seconds of realtime MPEG resolution 320x240
true color video with one shot ! With the enclosed software you can save
this with one command to single TGA pics onto the harddisk or save it as a
complete Hicolor movie (uncompressed, big file size).

PC-Hurricane also digitizes the resolutions: 384x288, 360x240, 320x240 and
320x200. So max. resolution is 1 PAL field (384x288). Field digitisation
is preferred, cause it gives no Interlace artifacts, due to motion...

So if you want to make a FLI file out of the 16 seconds sequence, no
problem, just start DTA17e (Dave's Targa Animator) and it produces a FLI
animation file out of the single TGA pics. Also, if you have the Xing
Technology software only MPEG encoder, it will be possible to compress
this about 400 single TARGA(tm) pics with just one second command to a
MPEG movie ! So you have in about 5 minutes of work a ready to display
MPEG movie !

PC-Hurricane has NTSC/PAL switchable. So it can also digitize NTSC video.
It has Video(FBAS) and Y/C(SVHS/Hi8) inputs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

MPEG 2.0 for windows3.x is now available !

It is the digital Video player via a software only solution ! It displays
in a 320x240 window under win3.x a realtime decompressed digital video !
Decompression is done only by software and it reaches 30 frames/sec on a
486 PC ! The new version has a very enhanced picture quality, because the
compression rate with the encoder can now be adjusted ! The very new thing
is the WAV-Sound support ! So if you have a soundcard inside your PC [or
the speaker-drv installed !], you will have a real video-clip with
accompagning sound !

They currently sell 3 demo disks with the full featured Player, version
2.0 and lots of animations on the disks.

It is available for 39.-DM over here in Germany, which is 26 US$.

[ argument (complete pathname !).                                         ]

[ So, if you start the player via double-click on a .mpg-File from the    ]
[ FILEMAN.EXE (or similar), the player doesn't find it's MFW.INI-File. It ]
[ can't read its system then, and the hole thing is fu**ed !!             ]

[ Or the player doesn't find his .INI-File, thinks that this was the      ]
[ first time it was started and:                                          ]

[   LEAVES A NEW MFW.INI-File in the current directory !!!                ]

[ Not in the one the player is, no ! In the current one. So my movies are ]
[ in g:\mpeg\movies, the player is somewhere under c:\windows.31\mpeg, I  ]
[ double-click on the .mpg-Movie and get a new MFW.INI in g:\mpeg\movie ! ]

[ Now the second 'maybe not so bad' bug:

[ The description says, to put the corresponding DLL-Files in the SYSTEM- ]

[ will look through the path-variable and try to load the DLL's from      ]
[ there.                                                                  ]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

BTW, the encoder still sells for 349.-DM and the MCI-driver for 199.-DM

[ The MCI-driver is nice, because it allows you to include movies in      ]
[ other documents. But it includes only the MPLAYER.EXE-icon in the       ]
[ document (not the first picture of the movie), the movie runs at        ]
[ whatever position (not where the icon is !), when you double-click it.  ]

[ Xing should have a close look at Microsoft's AVI-driver ;o) (but there  ]
[ movies are incredible slow and small, compared to MPEG  :o(             ]

24 bit to TV converter box which is a box connected outside of the PC to
the SVGA card via its VGA connector. There must be a TSR program run in the
background to change automatically the scanning frequencies of the SVGA
board. This works also very well with win3.1. It supports up to 800x600x
65K colors (only PAL) and 640x480 with 24 bits color (true color) on the
Genoa 7900 ET4000 SVGA board. It has  Video (FBAS) and Y/C (SVHS/HI8)
outputs.

There is also a version of this box with additional RGB output, so you get
the best picture quality on a TV-set with SCART - RGB-inputs..

The VGA Monitor is also connected to the 24 Bit to TV converter box, so if
you don't start the driver software, your system is like normal: You see
the picture on your SVGA monitor. The DC-power comes from the keyboard
connector, so you don't have to fiddle around with AC-DC-aptor power
supplies !

Just don't start the driver software, if you don't need video out ! The box
doesn't interfere with your daily work. Just forget it behind you PC. If
you need video out, just start the 2 KBytes driver software and then you
can toggle between video out and VGA monitor display with a hot key !

The driver software is adapted to SVGA FLIC-files from Autodesk Animator
PRO to give a 640x288 x256 colors Fullscreen-Overscan display on PAL TV-
sets. This works by using double scanning with 50 Hz Non-Interlace !
Every scanline from the 288 is scanned twice, so it gives 640x576
Fullscreen display ! (with no flicker)

This way you can record your favourite SVGA animations to tape without
seeing any black borders !

There is also a NTSC version available, which works only up to 640x480 with
16, 256 ,32K , 65 K and 24 bits colors ! On NTSC model the 640x480 mode is
already Fullscreen !

It also works with the new Hicolor FLI player, so you can play and record
hicolor animation directly from a RAMdisk to VCR tape. You don't need NO
single frame accurate expensive VCR anymore ! Cause it works also with
win3.1, you can record all your daily windows application work to video
tape !                                               
                                                                               
If you have a presentation program like Microsoft Powerpoint, no problem !
Just record your presentation to video tape to show it via video cassette
to everyone, who has a VCR !

In windows the 24 bit to TV-box works in 50 or 60 Hz Interlace to display
the 640x480 or 800x600 (only PAL) scanlines. This gives a little flicker on
Menu-buttons, which have only very small horizontal lines with big contrast
in color. So use an appropriate color palette under windows to reduce
flicker..

With the Y/C output (SVHS/Hi8) you almost get SVGA monitor quality on your
video tape !

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

VGA2TV adaptor. This is an internal board which is hooked inside the PC to
the feature connector of the VGA card. So the VGA or SVGA board must have a
feature connector ! The VGA2TV samples the contens of the VGA RAM into its
own dual ported RAM and gives it out with the Video scanning frequencies to
its Video (FBAS) or Y/C output. It also has a Genlock possibility. So it
can be used to do titling in front of a holiday movie video tape running in
the background of the computer graphics titles !

Input of the external video source could also be FBAS or Y/C. This unit is
called M2150 for the PAL version. M2100 is the NTSC version.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

VGA2TV PRO with integrated Flicker fixer. This is the new release of the
VGA2TV board. It has also a flicker filter for making the Interlace flicker
much less visible. It also has OverScan/Underscan feature and the position
of the screen on the TV set could be controlled via software. This board is
of course more expensive than the older VGA2TV, but still either cards are
sold.  The new one is called M2200 .

Both max resolutions to convert with these VGA2TV boards are 640x480 with
256 colors ! It has the advantage, that it does not need any software !
Just plug and it plays !

The MPEG-Player 'MPLAY.EXE' from Xing Technologies is included
in the 'MPEGXING.LZH'-file.

[ Terrible user-interface, but good quality. You can't interrupt ]
[ the movie. You have to see it all or re-boot. Works only for   ]
[ ET4000-cards.                                                  ]


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is another player called PLAYMPEG.ZIP including two executables
MPEG128.EXE and MPEG250.EXE (for 128 and 250 colors) by:

PLAYMPG v. 0.9 - Jan. 1993 - by Giampiero Caprino, Olivetti, Italy.
This is a pre-release version being distributed for evaluation

The modified berkeley-source-code is avilable as MPEGSRC.ZIP.

[ The user-interface is more comfortable than the MPEG.EXE one, but ]
[ these players here are terrible slow. Anyway, it shows how easy   ]
[ you can adapt the berkeley-code (see below) and port it to other  ]
[ systems. And it works on ALL VGA-cards !!!                        ]

[ Hopefully, Rowe, Patel and Smith include this additional code in  ]

The Genoa product presentation MPEG demo. Its available via
Ingenieurbuero Gatz & Hartmann,

This is what you need to play it:

  A fast 486 ( at least 33 Mhz) with 16 MBytes of RAM.
  Also it is a ET4000 board required. Local-Bus is also okay...

  [ Also you need about 20MB free disk space. 10 for the file ]
  [ and 10 for the SMARTDRV-Cache. Didn't try it on the PC,   ]
  [ but on the Sun's. It's a animated product info, not a     ]
  [ movie; not worth to bother !!                             ]

The Berkeley Plateau Research Group is happy to announce the release of
Version 2.0 of its software-only MPEG decoder. The player is available via
anonymous ftp from toe.cs.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.117) in
/pub/multimedia/mpeg/mpeg_play-2.0.tar.Z. You'll find many sample MPEG
streams in the subdirectory movies. 

Changes from v1.2 include:

o Fixed green artifact bug.
o Fixed sequence end code bug.
o Many bug fixes.
o Performance tweaks.


                  MPEG Video Software Decoder
                  (Version 2.0; Jan 27, 1993)

        Lawrence A. Rowe, Ketan Patel, and Brian Smith
 Computer Science Division-EECS, Univ. of Calif. at Berkeley

This directory contains a public domain MPEG video software
decoder. The decoder is implemented as a library that will
take a video stream and display it in an X window on an 8, 24
or 32 bit deep display.  The main routine is supplied to
demonstrate the use of the decoder library. Several dithering
algorithms are supplied based on the Floyd-Steinberg, ordered
dither, and half-toning algorithms that tradeoff quality and
performance. Neither the library nor the main routine handle
real-time synchronization or audio streams.

The decoder implements the standard described in the Committee 
Draft ISO/IEC CD 11172 dated December 6, 1991 which is
sometimes refered to as "Paris Format." The code has been
compiled and tested on the following platforms:

 HP PA-RISC (HP/UX 8.X, X11R4) (i.e., HP 9000/7XX and 9000/3XX)
 Sun Sparc (SunOS 4.X, X11R5)
 DECstation 5000 and Alpha
 IBM RS6000
 Silicon Graphics Indigo
 MIPS RISC/os 4.51
 Sequent Symmetry
 Sony NEWS
 and more than we can list here.

If you decide to port the code to a new architecture, please let
us know so that we can incorporate the changes into our sources.

This directory contains everything required to build and
display video. We have included source code, a makefile, an Imakefile,
installation instructions, and a man page. Data files can
be obtained from the same ftp site this was located in.
See the INSTALL file for instructions on how to
compile and run the decoder. 

The data files were produced by XING. XING data does not take
advantage of P or B frames (ie, frames with motion compensation). 
Performance of the player on XING data is significantly slower 
(half or less) than the performance when motion compensated MPEG 
data is decoded. We are very interested in running the software 
on other MPEG streams.  Please contact us if you have a stream 
that does not decode correctly. Also, please send us new streams
produced by others that do utilize P and B frames.

NOTE: One particular XING data file: raiders.mpg, is not a 
valid MPEG stream since it does not contain a sequence
header. 

We have established several mailing lists for messages about
the decoder:

mpeg-list-dist@CS.Berkeley.EDU 
   General information on the decoder for everyone interested 
   should be sent to this list.  This should become active after
   11/20/92

mpeg-list-request@CS.Berkeley.EDU
   Requests to join or leave the list should be sent to this 
   address. The subject line should contain the single word 
   ADD or DELETE.

mpeg-bugs@CS.Berkeley.EDU
   Problems, questions, or patches should be sent to this address.

Our future plans include porting the decoder to run on other
platforms, integrating it into a video playback system that
supports real-time synchronization and audio streams, and
further experiments to improve the performance of the
decoder. Vendors or other organizations interested in supporting 
this research or discussing other aspects of this project should 
contact Larry Rowe at Rowe@CS.Berkeley.EDU.

We also plan on producing an MPEG encoder. The encoder will NOT be
a real time digitizer, but will be intended for offline processing
of video data.

[ Brilliant !!! With a bit a power from a Sun or something like ]
[ this, MPEG can be real fun. There is no real user-interface,  ]
[ but the quality is first class !! Very easy to compile !!!    ]

[ Version 1.2 is just relased. Now with Imakefile and lots of   ]
[ bug-fixes. Executable is much smaller. Still gets some colors ]
[ wrong (with some movies).                                     ]

[ Version 2.0 is release and fixes this color- and other bugs.  ]

 VIII |  MAIL-ORDER
===================

                   GET THE "TRAIL-PACK" !!!
                  ==========================

You can purchase a complete archive named the "Trail-Pack" including the
FAQ and all named programs, source-code, movies and information-files.

This archive includes (in addition to the ftp- or e-mail-access) all
versions of the programs and source-code, additional movies (including the
audio-wav-files) and lots of additional informations.

It will contain at least

      1,450,737 MB of documentation
        170,186 MB of the FAQ's
      7,082,083 MB of movies
      1,185,177 MB of utilities
        109,423 MB of package-utilities
      =================================
      9,997,606 MB total

To obtain the "Trail-Pack" send a envelope, with the big-written
key-word "Trail-Pack" on it to:

      PHADE SOFTWARE
      Inh. Frank Gadegast

      Leibnizstr. 30
      1000 Berlin 12

      G E R M A N Y

and include in it:

 o  15 $ (fifteen US-Dollars), to pay the time I spend on copying disks
    and going to the post (money, that will be over, will be used to
    prepare the next version of this FAQ).

 o  10 HD-floppy-disk (3-1/2" or 5-1/2"), allready formatted (MSDOS).

 o  a hard-cover-envelope (big and strong enough to carry the 10 floppy-
    disks, written with YOUR correct adress.

 o  enough money (at least 3 $) to pay the postage of the "Trail-Pack"
    (the postage of your package to me, should be nearly the same,
    compared to, what I have to spend, to send the "Trail-Pack"; so,
    if you are living in Australia, send MORE money).

Try to send me a ENVELOPE, not a packet. It should go through the letter
box.


NOTE: There is no guarantee, how, and when you will get the "Trail-Pack"
      back. I'll do my best to prepare the packages as quick as possible.
      But I can't guarantee for the post ;o)

NOTE: Requests, that are NOT complete will be send back, using the
      included money. Is no money included, nothing will be send back
      and my archive will thank you for your floppy-disk-gift !!!
      Is there no money neither floppy-disks, your envelope will go
      to the bin.

NOTE: This is NOT a commercial offer, it's a service for those, that
      don't have internet-access !!!

ACHTUNG: Innerhalb Deutschland reichen DM 25 anstatt der 15 $ plus
         Briefgebuehr. Die "deutsche" Bestellung muss also DM 25,
         10 formatierte HD's und einen starken, genuegend grossen, an
         sich selbst addressierten Briefumschlag enthalten.

Philips CD-I wird ab Anfang naechsten Jahres offiziel Full-Screen,
Full-Motion Video koennen. Basis sind MPEG-komprimierte Videos. Die
benoetigte Hardware-Erweiterung basiert auf C-Cube, bin aber nicht
sicher. Kompression kann softwaremaessig erfolgen. Software existiert
fuer SUNs im CD-I-Entwicklerpaket (n x 100.000 DM). Die Rechenzeiten
fuer die Komression liegen bei 1:60 bis 1:400, also nichts mit
Realzeitkompression.

Intel's DVI-Technik kann noch kein MPEG (und das wird wohl auch noch
einige Zeit so bleiben).

Subject: Re: Xing's SW, Really MPEG Compression?
Date: Thu Nov 19 13:20:35 1992

Unfortunately, it is true. XING data is NOT true MPEG and in
fact does a lot of dubious things with its Inverse DCT.

XING data is simply a sequence of I-Frames (i.e. no interframe
compression is done, no motion vectors, nothing).
This amounts to little more than a sequence of JPEG type images.

I heard that MPEG II will be extended to 15 Mbps in order
to encompass HDTV applications.  This would unfortuantely delay
MPEG II however.

Hmm, considering that with Compact Video and QuickTime 1.5, I can easily
get 10 frames per second at 384 * 288 resolution on a lowly Mac LC
(16MHz 68020 with 16-bit memory path--sort of 386SX equivalent), I suspect
I'll have no trouble "reaching" 30 frames per second on something like a
IIci (25MHz 68030 with 32-bit memory path).

MPEG was never really designed for software-only playback...

There are no inherent speed limits built into QuickTime; performance is
entirely a function of available hardware. See the results of my speed
tests, which I've just posted to this newsgroup.

Subject: MPEG 1.0 on the NeXT

I have ported your MPEG player to a NeXT workstation to run under the
NeXTStep window system. Works great except the frame rate is a little low,
3.4 frames for flight.mpg. This is on a NeXTDimension running a 68040.
Don't really know if this is the maximum for this architecture.  I still
have a couple of things to try to increase the frame rate. Anyway thanks
for a really nice MPEG player.

Subject: MPEG 1.0 for Mac 

I would like to know if someone is working on the port of the MPEG decoder
1.0 for the Mac. Last night I succed in compiling the source on the Mac.
There are alot of problems, Think-C 5.04 no way and MPW-C is buggy gets
problems with inline macros.  The only compiler witch succeded on this code
was the old gcc 1.37. Now I start to find out how to write a quicktime
driver for MPEG (could take a while I am not a Mac guru).

Yes SGS-THOMSON has silicon which performs MPEG and H.261 decoding in real
time.

The STi3240 has been sampling for a while and is now in preproduction.
The chip has been very well received by all of our customers and we have
been succesful in winning some major design ins'.

There was a correction in the trade journal where I saw the MPEG II
extension mentioned.  They are now saying that, yes, they did agree to
extend MPEG II's target bit rate to meet the needs of HDTV applications,
but that there is no real upper limit to the MPEG II compressed rate, and
that they expect no delays in the completion of the final spec, scheduled
for March 1993.

Since I got the source for version 1.1 of mpeg_play, I was thinking of
making a Mac viewer myself over Christmas holidays from school and work.
Unless you all ready know of one. No use rediscovering the wheel!

Well, first you can check the related news-groups:

  comp.graphics, comp.graphics.animation, comp.compression, comp.multimedia,
  comp.sys.amiga.multimedia, comp.mail.multi-media,
  alt.binaries.pictures.utilities

The first part of this FAQ about MPEG came from Mark Adler, published in
in FAQ for the newsgroup 'comp.compression'.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then you can ask 'archie' to find all NEW mpeg-releated software
by sending the following mail (with no title):

  prog mpeg mpg
  quit

to one of the following archie-mail-servers:

 XIII | QUESTIONS
=================

These are some questions, ideas or whatever problems, where still no
solutions is found or nobody knows an answer. Please contact me via e-mail
if YOU find a solution for:

1) Is there somebody out there (maybe from the MPEG-group), that could
   rewrite the first section of this FAQ, to bring it up to MPEG-II ?

2) Is Xing connected to the internet or compuserve or something ?
   Is there somebody responsible for there product ?

3) Is berkeley's MPEG-viewer working with MPEG-movie including I- and
   B-frames ? Are there movies coded with I- or B-frames ?

4) Are there multimedia-specialized mailboxes out there ? Please send
   a filelisting of your mpeg-archive, a description of how to obtain
   the files, costs, connection times, telefon-numbers etc.
