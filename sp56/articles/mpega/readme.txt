        THE MPEG-FAQ         [Version 1.1 - 19. February 1993]
        ======================================================

===========================================================================

This is my summary about MPEG.

It's the second publication of this file. Lots of errors have been removed,
and lots of information has been added (which has surely brought other
errors with it, see Murphy's Law).

This is the second version of my summary about MPEG, I needed to re-prepare
the FAQ, because several new chips, software and infos appeared.

This is the header of the FAQ. The following archive contains the real FAQ,
a sample movie called INDEX.MPG and a info-file called INDEX.TXT .

===========================================================================

You should received two files called:

  MPEGFA11.ZIP-[1/2]
  MPEGFA11.ZIP-[2/2]


 UNPACKING
===========

Save these two files in the right order to ONE file, strip every header-information
of the file, let 'uudecode' with the command:

  uudecode <your-file>

run overit, and unpack the resulting zip-archive on MSDOS-system with the
utility 'pkunzip' and the command:

  pkunzip mpegfa11.zip

and on Unix-like systems with the utility 'unzip' installed with the command

  unzip mpegfa11.zip



 ERRORS
========

If you can't unpack the FAQ, please reply immediately to me:

  phade@cs.tu-berlin.de

to prevent others from the same errors ...


Enjoy MPEG, Phade
