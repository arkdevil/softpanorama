                               users.

As people kept talking about WINDOW as WINDOWS (which is popular shortcut
from MS-WINDOWS) I have changed to name of my library to SLICK!

SLICK! version 3.2 is available for download on Mailbox-CG for non-registered
users. The main difference between registered and non-registered versions is
that registering gives you latest version with sources! However, some sources
are available only for some extra, they were damn hard to write...

So, first to features and bug fixes -

  * Includes easy-to-use but yet powerful menu engine.
  * Mouse driver which works under DESQview as well as without it.
    Mouse driver is "invisible" to upper level.
  * Mouse support for menu engine.
  * Much faster than 2.x versions.
  * Auto-detects EGA lines and other video parameters.
  * Sets video mode to BIOS data, thus fixing bugs on some VGA systems which
    return video mode 7 on dual diasplay system with INT 10 but do not set
    BIOS variable.  
  * Smart snow check, activates only on CGA by default.
  * Allows user-defined virtual screens (set any segment for screen).
  * _mymalloc() is TC malloc compatible.

Coming next -

  * Hypertext engine
  * Communications

Why register?

  a) You get sources.
  b) You get access to SLICK! support area on MailBox-CG. I will answer
     to all messages related to SLICK! Non-registered users are on their
     own... This file area also contains "companions" to SLICK!, which are
     higher level functions or function groups (for example windows with
     shadows and file selection boxes).
  c) You can upgrade for small fee on significant changes. Bug fixes and
     simple updates free.
  d) You will get mouse support which is not available in non-registered
     version.

How to register?

1) Send me money by mail and you will have access to file area where
   you will find latest registered version. This will work only with
   people who have modem.

   Not that this option is only partially available at the moment. You
   will get access to support area, allright, but distribution software
   is not finished yet.

2) For people in Tallinn easiest way is to arrange a time and just go
   over with 5 inch floppy disk and money in the pocket.

3) Send me money and 5 inch floppy disk. I will return the disk with
   latest version. In this case you must also write you snailmail address
   so I know where to send this thing. In this case you must add money
   for mailing. It is _your_ responsibility to pack your floppy good enough
   for our postage system, thick cardboard envelope is usually good enough.


How much does it costs?

  Registration is on a site basis.  One registration entitles use of the code
by one programmer or one office.  Companies or agencies that use these
libraries or code in developing software at multiple sites must have one
registered copy per site.  Prices are in roubles for poor guys struggling for
life in USSR, or in US dollars for guys living in shining west. Prices in
roubles may change in the future because the value of rouble drops fast...
