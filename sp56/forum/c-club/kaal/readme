SLICK! v3.2

  SLICK! is my own screen library. It's not as powerful as some shareware and
commercial products, but it's REALLY EASY TO USE! As function call overhead
to far functions is relatively small, I wrote this package so that all things
which can be near or far are FAR. Functions held in SLICK!.LIB do not need any
functions from TC library, all functions will work with memory models from
SMALL to LARGE.
  In it's current state this library is free to use for anyone, but it must
be distributed only as entire package, sources are still my property and may
not be used as part of your source. What I mean is that you can use whichever
function from library in whatever program you want, but if you're going to
write your own package and distribute it, my sources (or parts of them) may
not be used in it. The sources are just to make your life easier and if you
find any bugs, you can fix them ( send me a note please! ).
  Note that sources for v3.0 and above are available only to registered users
or beta testers...
