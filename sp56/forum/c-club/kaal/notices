                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  As the v3.0 was released just for testing the menu engine I made it clear
that this is not final version. And it has happened - the menu strucure has
changed. So if you have program which uses menu engine from v3.0 you must
add one NULL pointer to ME_MENU structure. It is used by menu engine to keep
track of paths in menu structure.

  As SLICK! allocates memory directly from DOS heap, you _must_ release all
allocated memory. So if you let your program abort with ^C or just don't
release all memory blocks (as windows use memory also, you have to close or
"forget" all windows also) the message 'Out of memory' will be the result
after returning to DOS.
