  This is defined in SLICK!.H as "extern WINDOW far *_curntwnd", it's
  pointing to active window structure all the time if there is any opened
  windows. Else it's NULL pointer, meaning that we don't have any windows
  opened yet. It may not be pointing to the window you opened last, because
  pushwnd() and popwnd() may move it around.
