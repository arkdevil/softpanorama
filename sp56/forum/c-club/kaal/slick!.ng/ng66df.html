   <B>int far shrnkwnd(int step);</B>

   This is reverse zoom, it's like closewnd(), but the window like sinks
 into the screen. I don't encourage you to use this function, because it's
 too big and does too few. I wrote it just to try it out, but now it's here
 and maybe you like it. It does everything what closewnd() does, and then
 removes window from screen by reducing the size of frames. By the way, it
 uses the closewnd() to release memory and adjust list if it finishes.

 <B>Parameters :</B>

 step       Vertical zoom step, horizontal is always 3 times bigger. Only
            reasonable step seems to be 1, else you won't see what's going
            on.

 <B>Return :</B>

 1 if OK, 0 if no window exists or step is less than 1.

 <B>Example :</B>

 #include "window.h"
 #include &lt;bios.h&gt;

 void main(void)
 {
     while (1)
         makewnd(10,4,69,20,FATFRAME,0x7070,1);
         shrnkwnd(1);
         if (bioskey(1))
             break;
     }
     while (bioskey(1))
         bioskey(0);
 }
