                         <B>Using SLICK! v3.2</B>

   As I wrote SLICK! for myself, it's an echo of my programming style,
 thus it may be necessary for you to take a look to sources in order to
 fully understand what I'm doing. But in general, here is a list of
 things you must keep in mind when using this product.

   * Memory allocation.

     All memory for package internal use is allocated from DOS's heap.
     Before each memory allocation DOS is forced to use memory allocation
     strategy 2 (last fit) and after that original allocation strategy is
     restored. Turbo C will alloacte memory be expanding PSP block, so
     they will not interfere with each other. However, allocating memory
     directly from DOS may cause troubles if you do not realese memory you
     have allocated (for example aborting program with 
nd leaving windows
     open on screen) DOS will respond with "Out of memory".

   * Memory models.

     I'm using compact model usually, so I have no problems with data
     pointers and TC can handle far calls gracefully when functions are
     prototyped. In small data models, however, TurboC 2.01 cannot generate
     array of far pointers (TC++ 1.0 can handle it).

   * "Snow" removal.

     Starting from version 3.0 snow removal if set on only on CGA cards,
     if you need, you can turn it off by clearing one flag in VIDEO
     structure.

   * Timer tick usage.

     _inittimer() will install itself int timer tick chain, so do not forget
     to use _deinittimer() before exiting the program.

   * Using mouse.

     Mouse interface allows you to define cursor style and initial position,
     however, these parameters will be simply ignored under DESQview. Also
     note that it is perfectly OK to reinstall mouse driver to position cursor
     but installation will take many seconds on PS/2 and some 386 machines.
     And besides, let the user do the driving.
