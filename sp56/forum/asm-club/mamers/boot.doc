	BOOT is a small piece of code I wrote initially for 8086-type machines
	many years ago. As I am now using a 80386 for BBSing with DesqView and
	HyperDisk, I discovered that my old program simply hung in a DV window
	on 386.  Thus I made clear  how to make this code 386-aware  (thanx to
	BNU,  a FOSSIL driver,  which can reboot in any  environment).  It was
	quite simple procedure.  But as I am using  the disk cache  with write
	optimization,  there naturally arouse a problem how to flush out cache
	buffers to disk before rebooting the computer. I made some 'inquiries'
	inside HyperDisk,  and found out  how to send it a signal  to "disable
	caching".  And here is  the result of my work.  This is  an alpha-test
	version yet,  as I myself  have been  using the program only  for some
	days. It seems to work fine with DV 2.31 and HD 4.12. Hereby I distri-
	bute the program with most of its source code included. If you dare to
	have a look at the code and try the program in action, I would be very
	glad to  hear of the  results. Any error  reports and  suggestions are
	welcome!
