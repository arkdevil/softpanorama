
	HyperChk program is intended primarily for batch files,
espesially if you want your system boot process behave differently
in Hyperdisk is loaded.

	It exits with errorlevel 0 if HyperDisk is installed, 1 otherwise.

	Also, it's convenient if you want to disable/enable hyperdisk
(or change it's staged write option) if it's installed:

	REM disable staged writes
	hyperchk && hyperdk W
	REM do disk defragmentation
	optune /op
	REM enable staged writes
	hyperchk && hyperdk S

	No warranty is given. You may use this program (executable
and source code) freely if its copyright notice isn't altered.
