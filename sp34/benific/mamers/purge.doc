
	             PURGE - A Garbage Cleaner
	         Version 2.1 --- MamSoft 1988,1989

	PURGE helps you keep your file system free from all kinds
	of backups, temporaries and other trash.

	When running PURGE without parameters, it deletes all files
	matching the masks  *.BAK  (various backups),  *.~* (Norton
	Editor  backups) and *.TMP (temporaries)  from the  current
	directory and  its subdirectories.  When given  a directory
	name as a parameter,  files are processed in that directory
	and its subdirectories.  PURGE \ cleans up garbage from the
	whole disk.

	You may  also  specify  your own  list of  filenames  to be
	deleted by PURGE.  Desired file masks  are listed in confi-
	guration file PURGE.CFG;  entries are separated with white-
	space  (spaces, tabs, or newlines).  The configuration file
	is first  searched for  in the current directory,  and then
	in the root directory,  when it is not found in the current
	one. The following is an example of the PURGE.CFG file:
	*.~*  *.$*  *.BAK  *.TMP  TMP.*  TEMP.*  *.CHK  *._*

	Beware of  careless-made  file entries,  such as  *.*,  and
	using afterwards PURGE \ - it saves you a lot of trouble.
