  ArcView is a simple, compact and efficient full-screen archive
viewer for Norton Commander 3.0, but it can be used as stand-alone
program due to it's comfortability. This small utility supports
verbose listing of all the files archived in LHarc, PKArc, Arc, Pak,
Arj, Zoo and PKzip. You do not need these archivers to be present on 
your disk(s). ArcView supports 43/50 lines screen modes, but works in 
25 line mode as well. Mouse support also built-in. Originally there is 
no special room for ArcView in Norton Commander. Due to this ArcView
Install replaces Lotus-123 viewer with ArcView, so You can't view
Lotus-123 files with F3. Anyway, if You still want to view Lotus-123
files, You may type 123VIEW <FileName> or install this to Norton
Commander's "Extension File".
