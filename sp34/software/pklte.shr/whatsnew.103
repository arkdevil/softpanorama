
The following items are new, changed, or fixed from version 1.00
of PKLITE in this release of version 1.03 of the PKLITE software.


- In rare instances some .EXE files compressed by PKLITE would
  erroneously display the message "Not Enough Memory" when run.
  This has been corrected.

- Files with very large .EXE relocation headers sometimes could
  not be compressed or would not run in compressed format.  This
  has been corrected.

- Files compressed with LZEXE and extracted with UNLZEXE and then
  compressed with PKLITE would not run correctly, or would compress
  bigger than if the original .EXE file was compressed.

  This is because UNLZEXE does not restore the .EXE file exactly
  as the original file (unlike PKLITE, which does).  Specifically,
  UNLZEXE writes the .EXE relocation header in an unoptimal, non-
  canonical form.  PKLITE version 1.03 can compress UNLZEXE'd files
  and they will run correctly, however the HDROPT program included
  in this version can be used to normalize the .EXE relocation data
  and allow PKLITE to compress UNLZEXE'd files much smaller.

  HDROPT optimizes a file's .EXE relocation header storing each
  header in a normalized canonical from, yielding much better
  compression with PKLITE.  While most popular compilers/linkers
  usually write the relocation entries in canonical form when
  creating .EXE files, HDROPT is useful for files created by
  UNLZEXE and perhaps other linkers that create un-normalized
  relocation headers.

  Also, when compressing some .EXE files, especially produced
  in a development environment with DEBUGGING options enabled,
  some people have reported that LZEXE compresses smaller than
  PKLITE.  This is because LZEXE automatically strips any debug
  data from an executable file when compressing it.  PKLITE only
  strips this data when the -r option is used.  In almost every
  single case, PKLITE with the -r option should compress better
  than LZEXE when debugging data is present in an .EXE file.

- A new program CHK4LITE is included in this version.  CHK4LITE
  can be used to determine if a file has been compressed with
  PKLITE.  CHK4LITE returns an errorlevel of 0 (zero) if none
  of the file(s) scanned was compressed with PKLITE, 1 (one) if
  at least one file was compressed with PKLITE and 2 (two) if at
  least one file was compressed with the extra option in PKLITE
  Professional.  If both types of compressed files are scanned,
  CHK4LITE will return two.
