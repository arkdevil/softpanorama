About This Help File:
=====================
New users and experienced users of Windows 95 alike can benefit 
from the contents of this help file.  Perhaps you have seen other 
Windows 95 compilations with so called "Tips and Tricks."  This 
one is just a little bit different.  With the exception of a few 
entries in this help file, most of the information cannot be 
found by using Windows 95 from day to day.  Other "Tips and 
Tricks" resources usually tend to dwell on simple things that most 
people will eventually figure out.  One of the goals of this help 
file is to avoid that redundant approach to getting the most out 
of Windows 95.

For information on some of the more basic features of Windows 95, 
refer to the text file 'tips.txt', which is located in the Windows 
directory (i.e., c:\windows).

The author of this help file is not responsible in any way for any 
type(s) of unwanted result(s) from the use of the tips, tricks, 
and/or secrets obtained from this help file.
