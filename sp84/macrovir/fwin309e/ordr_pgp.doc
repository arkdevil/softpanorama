
               F/WIN ANTI-VIRUS PRICING/ORDERING INFORMATION
               =============================================


These are the instructions that explain how to complete the order
form that appears in file ORDR_PGP.TXT.



USE THESE ORDER INSTRUCTIONS ONLY IF YOU WANT THE REGISTERED
VERSION SENT TO YOU BY E-MAIL, USING PGP ASCII ARMOR ENCRYPTION.
IT WILL NOT BE SENT AS A BINARY ATTACHED FILE.  IT WILL BE A
REGULAR E-MAIL MESSAGE CONTAINING PGP ASCII ARMOR.  YOU WILL NEED
TO SEND US YOUR PGP PUBLIC KEY BEFORE WE CAN SEND YOU THE FILES.
YOU MAY E-MAIL THIS COMPLETED FORM TO US, OR SEND IT BY REGULAR
MAIL.  IF YOU WISH TO E-MAIL IT USING OUR PGP PUBLIC KEY, USE THE
KEY IN FILE "GM.PGP", AND SEND IT TO:   FWIN_SUP@IX.NETCOM.COM.

Please note that the information given below only applies to the
English language shareware version of the program, which is only
available directly from the United States.

Since it is less expensive for us to ship the software to you
through the Internet, we are able to pass those savings along to
you by offering lower prices for software shipped that way.


Corporate/Business/Personal licenses
-------------------------------------

You have the option of having all the software shipped through
the Internet, or via the mail on diskettes.  By selecting this
order option you have indicated to us that you wish to receive
your order as a PGP ASCII armor e-mail message.  NO DISKETTES
WILL BE SHIPPED TO YOU.

When determining how many PC's F/WIN Anti-Virus will be
used on, you only need to come up with a reasonable estimate.  It
is not necessary to determine an exact count.

A description of each of the columns that appear in the
table below is as follows:

Quantity:  How many PC's F/WIN will be used on.

Receive Order by E-mail:  How much it costs per PC if ALL F/WIN
           anti-virus files can be sent to you through the
           Internet via e-mail. That includes the FWIN.KEY file.
           This is the MINIMUM cost to purchase registered copies
           of F/WIN.  The software you receive may be copied for
           the purpose of distributing it throughout your
           organization.




OPTIONAL #1:  If you decided to subscribe to the quarterly update
           service by having diskettes shipped to you, this is
           what it costs to have 1 update diskette shipped to you
           4 times a year.  The minimum amount is $75.  You may
           copy these update diskettes to distribute the software
           throughout your oranization.  You also have the option
           of downloading updates from the internet at NO CHARGE.
           ONLY CHOOSE THIS OPTION IF YOU WANT TO RECEIVE
           QUARTERLY UPDATES VIA DISKETTES SHIPPED TO YOU.



                                    (OPTIONAL #1)

                                    Additional amt
                                    for each disk
                  Receive order     for UPDATES
Quantity          by E-mail         (Minimum = $75)
--------          -------------     ---------------

1                  $30   per PC          $75
2    -   9          20   per PC           35
10   -   24         15   per PC           25
25   -   49         12   per PC           10
50   -   99         5$   per PC            5
100  -   249        4$   per PC            3
250  -   499        3$   per PC            2
500  -   999        2$   per PC            1
1000 -  2499        1$   per PC            1
2500 -  4999        0.8  per PC            1
5000+               0.5  per PC            1

Example:  A corporation wants to get a license for 1,000 PC's.
But they only need 10 diskettes to get the software distributed
because most of the PC's are on LAN's.  They also want to
subscribe to the diskette update service.  They would like 25
update diskettes mailed to them each quarter.  Using the above
order form, and assuming the company is located in the state of
Ohio (sales tax example), Here's what the values would be.  Refer
to the order form in file ORDR_PGP.TXT:


A =  1,000     PC's

B =  $1.00     per PC

C =  $1,000    (A times B)

D =  25        UPDATE diskettes to be sent each quarter

E =  $1.00     per diskette

F =  $75       (D times E = $25, but the minimum is $75)

G =  $1,075    Sub-Total (C plus F)

H =  $61.81    Ohio Sales Tax ($1,075 x .0575)

I =  $1,136.18   (Total)

                            HOW TO OBTAIN UPDATES
                            =====================

1.  Updates (which is the shareware version) can be downloaded
    from the following web sites.  It will also be available
    on several FTP sites by the end of March.  Watch our
    web page for more info.

    http://www.entrepreneurs.net/fwin  (this is our temporary
                                       URL until our domain
                                       name is registered)
    http://fwin.com                   (this will be our
                                       permanent URL when it
                                       becomes available in
                                       the early to middle
                                       of March, 1996)

    The FWIN.KEY file you obtain with your paid order
    entitles you to legally download updates and use them
    for a period of 1-year.  Using they FWIN.KEY file beyond
    1-year is illegal unless you have paid the subscription
    fee to renew it.  Placing the FWIN.KEY file in the same
    directory as the F/WIN shareware version will cause the
    shareware version to function like the registered version.


                    RENEWING THE F/WIN SUBSCRIPTION
                    ===============================

F/WIN Anti-Virus must be renewed every year.  THE RENEWAL FEE IS
NOT A PART OF THE QUARTERLY DISKETTE UPDATES FEE.  THE RENEWAL
FEE IS A SEPERATE FEE.  Currently, the only way to pay for that
renewal is to mail a check or money order payable to "COMPUTER
VIRUS SOLUTIONS" to the following address:

           Computer Virus Solutions
           Subscription Renewal
           P.O. Box 30802
           Gahanna, Ohio  43230
           United States of America

You may receive your confirmation of renewal either by
e-mail or postcard.  Include a note with your check specifying
which you prefer.  Watch our WWW site for more news about this in
the coming months.
