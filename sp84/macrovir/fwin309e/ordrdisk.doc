
               F/WIN ANTI-VIRUS PRICING/ORDERING INFORMATION
               =============================================


These are the instructions that explain how to complete the order
form that appears in file ORDRDISK.TXT.


USE THESE ORDER INSTRUCTIONS ONLY IF YOU WANT THE REGISTERED
VERSION SENT TO YOU BY REGULAR MAIL ON DISKETTES.

YOU MAY E-MAIL THIS COMPLETED FORM TO US, OR SEND IT BY REGULAR
MAIL.  IF YOU WISH TO E-MAIL IT USING OUR PGP PUBLIC KEY, USE THE
KEY IN FILE "GM.PGP", AND SEND IT TO:   FWIN_SUP@IX.NETCOM.COM.

Please note that the information given below only applies to the
English language shareware version of the program, which is only
available directly from the United States.


Corporate/Business/Personal licenses
-------------------------------------

You have the option of having all the software shipped through
the Internet, or via the mail on diskettes.  By selecting this
order option you have indicated to us that you wish to receive
your order by regular mail on diskettes.

When determining how many PC's F/WIN Anti-Virus will be
used on, you only need to come up with a reasonable estimate.  It
is not necessary to determine an exact count.

A description of each of the columns that appear in the
table below is as follows:

Quantity:  How many PC's F/WIN will be used on.

Receive Order by Diskette:  This column shows how much it costs
           per diskette.  The cost per diskette is affected by
           how many registered users of F/WIN there are.

OPTIONAL #1:  If you decided to subscribe to the quarterly update
           service by having diskettes shipped to you, this is
           what it costs to have 1 update diskette shipped to you
           4 times a year.  The minimum amount is $75.  You may
           copy these update diskettes to distribute the software
           throughout your oranization.  You also have the option
           of downloading updates from the internet at NO CHARGE.
           ONLY CHOOSE THIS OPTION IF YOU WANT TO RECEIVE
           QUARTERLY UPDATES VIA DISKETTES SHIPPED TO YOU.

Quantity          by Diskette       (Minimum = $75)
--------          -------------     ---------------

1                  $30   per PC          $75
2    -   9          20   per PC           35
10   -   24         15   per PC           25
25   -   49         12   per PC           10
50   -   99         5$   per PC            5
100  -   249        4$   per PC            3
250  -   499        3$   per PC            2
500  -   999        2$   per PC            1
1000 -  2499        1$   per PC            1
2500 -  4999        0.8  per PC            1
5000+               0.5  per PC            1

Example:  A corporation wants to get a license for 1,000 PC's.
But they only need 10 diskettes to get the software distributed
because most of the PC's are on LAN's.  They also want to
subscribe to the diskette update service.  They would like 25
update diskettes mailed to them each quarter.  Using the above
order form, and assuming the company is located in the state of
Ohio (sales tax example), Here's what the values would be.  Refer
to the order form in file ORDR_PGP.TXT:

A =  1,000     PC's

B =  $1.00     per PC

C =  $1,000    (A times B)

D =  10        diskettes for original software (1-copy each)

E =  $1        $1 per PC for 1000 PC's

F =  $10       Cost for all 10 diskettes containing the
               original F/WIN Anti-Virus software

G =  25        Number of UPDATE diskettes to be sent each quarter

H =  $1.00     per diskette

I =  $75       (G times H = $25, but the minimum is $75)

J =  $1,085    Sub-Total (C plus F plus I)

K =  $62.39    Ohio Sales Tax ($1,075 x .0575)

L =  $1,147.39     (Total)

                                   URL until our domain
                                   name is registered)

                            HOW TO OBTAIN UPDATES
                            =====================

1.  Updates (which is the shareware version) can be downloaded
    from the following web sites.  It will also be available
    on several FTP sites by the end of March.  Watch our
    web page for more info.

    http://www.valleynet.com/~joe
    http://www.entrepreneurs.net/fwin  (this is our temporary
                                       URL until our domain
                                       name is registered)

    http://fwin.com                    (this will be our
                                       permanent URL when it
                                       becomes available in
                                       the early to middle
                                       of May, 1996)

    The FWIN.KEY file you obtain with your paid order
    entitles you to legally download updates and use them
    for a period of 1-year.  Using they FWIN.KEY file beyond
    1-year is illegal unless you have paid the subscription
    fee to renew it.  Placing the FWIN.KEY file in the same
    directory as the F/WIN shareware version will cause the
    shareware version to function like the registered version.


                    RENEWING THE F/WIN SUBSCRIPTION
                    ===============================

F/WIN Anti-Virus must be renewed every year.  THE RENEWAL FEE IS
NOT A PART OF THE QUARTERLY DISKETTE UPDATES FEE.  THE RENEWAL
FEE IS A SEPERATE FEE.  Currently, the only way to pay for that
renewal is to mail a check or money order payable to "COMPUTER
VIRUS SOLUTIONS" to the following address:

           Computer Virus Solutions
           Subscription Renewal
           P.O. Box 30802
           Gahanna, Ohio  43230
           United States of America

You may receive your confirmation of renewal either by
e-mail or postcard.  Include a note with your check specifying
which you prefer.  Watch our WWW site for more news about this in
the coming months.

               F/WIN ANTI-VIRUS PRICING/ORDERING INFORMATION
               =============================================

These are the instructions that explain how to complete the order
form that appears in file ORDRFORM.TXT.

Please note that the information given below only applies to the
English language shareware version of the program, which is only
available directly from the United States.

Since it is less expensive for us to ship the software to you
through the Internet, we are able to pass those savings along to
you by offering lower prices for software shipped that way.


Corporate/Business/Personal licenses
-------------------------------------

You have the option of having all the software shipped through
the Internet, or via the mail on diskettes.  You also have the
option of how many diskettes you wish to receive.  If the
software will be placed on a network, then only one diskette is
needed.  Ordering fewer diskettes will reduce your overall
expense.  When determining how many PC's F/WIN Anti-Virus will be
used on, you only need to come up with a reasonable estimate.  It
is not necessary to determine an exact count.

A description of each of the four columns that appear in the
table below is as follows:

Quantity:  How many PC's F/WIN will be used on.

Internet:  How much it costs per PC if ALL F/WIN anti-virus files
           can be sent to you through the Internet via e-mail.
           That includes the FWIN.KEY file.  This is the MINIMUM
           cost to purchase registered copies of F/WIN.

OPTIONAL #1:  If some or all of the files needed to ship F/WIN
           Anti-Virus to you must be shipped on diskettes instead
           of through the internet, this column shows how much
           it costs per diskette.  The cost per diskette is
           affected by how many registered users of F/WIN there
           are.

OPTIONAL #2:  If you decided to subscribe to the quarterly update
           service by having diskettes shipped to you, this is
           what it costs to have 1 update diskette shipped to you
           4 times a year.

Example:  A corporation wants to get a license for 1,000 PC's.
But they only need 10 diskettes to get the software distributed
because most of the PC's are on LAN's.  They also want to
subscribe to the diskette update service.  They would like 25

A =  1,000 PC's

B =  $1.00 per PC

C =  $1,000   (A times B)

D =  10 diskettes  (these will be used to initially distribute
                    F/WIN throughout the organization)

E =  $1.00 per diskette

F =  $10      (D times E)

G =  $1,010   (C plus E)

H =  $68.18   ($1,010 x .0675)

              ========================================

1.  Download the shareware version from an FTP site.
    After receiving your payment by mail, we'll send you
    your unique key file which turns the shareware version
    into the registered version.  You may receive your key
    file in any of the following ways:

    a.  By mail on a floppy diskette.
    b.  By e-mail as a PGP encrypted binary file
        attachment (make sure you're e-mail system allows
        this)
    c.  A UUENCODE'd e-mail message (must be PGP
        encrypted, though)
    d.  A PGP ASCII file sent in an e-mail message

    If you wish to receive your key file by e-mail, you
    must make sure to send us your PGP public key.  We
    will not send an unencrypted key file through the
    Internet.

    you'll receive will be a self-extracting PKZIP compressed
    file.

2.  All software sent on a diskette.

                                       permanent URL when it
                                       becomes available in

    The FWIN.KEY file you obtain with your paid order
    entitles you to legally download updates and use them
    for a period of 1-year.  Using they FWIN.KEY file beyond
    1-year is illegal unless you have paid the subscription
    fee to renew it.


                    RENEWING THE F/WIN SUBSCRIPTION
                    ===============================

F/WIN Anti-Virus must be renewed every year.  Currently, the
only way to pay for that renewal is to mail a check or
money order payable to "COMPUTER VIRUS SOLUTIONS" to the
following address:

           Computer Virus Solutions
           Subscription Renewal
           P.O. Box 30802
           Gahanna, Ohio  43230
           United States of America

You may receive your confirmation of renewal either by
e-mail or postcard, whichever you prefer.  Watch our WWW
site for more news about this in the coming months.  If
you will receive the updates on diskettes instead of
downloading them yourself through the internet, there
is an additional charge for receiving the quarterly
update diskettes.  That charge is currently $35
(February, 1996).
