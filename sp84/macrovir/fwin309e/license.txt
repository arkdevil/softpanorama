Anti-Virus that expires on a certain date.  You may receive a
copy of this version only directly from Stefan Kurtzhals, or an
authorized F/WIN Anti-Virus distributor.  The EVALUATION version
may NOT be copied or given to third parties without the written
permission of Stefan Kurtzhals or an authorized F/WIN Anti-Virus

     WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS AND YOU MAY ALSO
     HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO
     JURISDICTION.

     hardware or software without the expressed written consent

     distributor.

18.  User agrees to pay all legal costs for the plaintiff,
     Stefan Kurtzhals, if litigation is undertaken to deal with
     user's illegal distribution of F/WIN Anti-Virus software
     and/or key file(s).

     of all the executable and documentation files may be

     diskettes, hard drives, backup tapes, or any other
     storage medium.

III.  REGISTRATION
=================================================================

F/WIN is not free software!  You may evaluate this product, but
if you decide to make use of it beyond the expiration date, you
must register your copy.

For more information on how to register F/WIN Anti-Virus, see the
enclosed ORDER.DOC file.

Registered users of F/WIN Anti-Virus enjoy the following extra
benefits:

1.   The macro virus cleaning facility will be active for all
     file names, not just NORMAL.DOT as is the case in the
     SHAREWARE version.

2.   The /PARANOID feature is activated, allowing for more in-
     depth scans for Microsoft Word macro viruses.

3.   The /REPORT= feature is activated, allowing the user to
     generate reports to disk of what F/WIN finds during its
     scan.  This also allows for use of the /CLEANALL and
     /WIPEALL features (they can't be used without /REPORT=).

4.   While both registered and unregistered users of F/WIN will
     receive customer support, registered users receive priority.

5.   Future releases of F/WIN Anti-Virus may be downloaded from
     various FTP and WWW sites on the internet.  Registered users
     will have immediate access to all the latest features and
     enhancements.

By using a legal Registered Version of F/WIN Anti-Virus, user
agrees that it is forbidden to knowingly give away for free,
or to sell the FWIN.KEY file.  Transfer of the FWIN.KEY file
to any third party is forbidden.  Ownership of all the executable
and documentation files may be TRANSFERRED in whole (but not
in part) to another owner, but the FWIN.KEY file may NOT be
transferred to any third party under any circumstances.  User
agrees to only use a key file (FWIN.KEY) that was LEGALLY
obtained. "TRANSFERRED" means that the original legal owner
gives away, or sells all of the F/WIN Anti-Virus files (except
the FWIN.KEY file), and said owner no longer possesses any
copies of those files on any magnetic medium such as diskettes,
hard drives, backup tapes, or any other storage medium.



                    THE REGISTRATION KEY FILE
                    =========================

Registered users receive a registration key file called
FWIN.KEY. The key file will contain important information
such as the license number and the name of the license owner.

The key file FWIN.KEY is NOT to be sold or transferred in any
way.  The F/WIN Anti-Virus program searches for the key file
in the same directory where the program file itself resides.

If the key file is corrupt or invalid, the F/WIN Anti-Virus
will continue without producing an error message.  However,
F/WIN Anti-Virus will then turn into the normal unregistered
SHAREWARE version.

Although you are allowed to use the SHAREWARE F/WIN Anti-Virus
product for a period of 30 days, it is ILLEGAL to use it in
combination with a key, produced without authorization of Stefan
Kurtzhals or an authorized F/WIN Anti-Virus distributor.  It is
also ILLEGAL to use a key generated by any software not
distributed by Stefan Kurtzhals or an authorized F/WIN Anti-Virus
distributor.

The FWIN.KEY file you obtain with your paid order entitles the
user to legally download updates and use them for a period of
1-year.  Using they FWIN.KEY file beyond one-year is illegal
unless user has paid the fee to renew it.  The renewal fee is
equal to the fee paid to purchase F/WIN Anti-Virus at current
prices.  For instance, if user purchased a copy of F/WIN Anti-
Virus in March, 1996 for $30, and F/WIN was selling for $35 in
March, 1997, it would cost user $35 to renew F/WIN Anti-Virus in
March, 1997.

Stefan Kurtzhals reserves the right to modify F/WIN Anti-Virus,
without notice to users, to no longer use existing FWIN.KEY
files.  In such cases, owners of F/WIN Anti-Virus would need to
specify the serial number of their existing FWIN.KEY file before
they would be issued a new FWIN.KEY file.  A database will be
used to track FWIN.KEY file owners to help assure that only
owners of legal key files are given the new versions.  Notice of
such a key file change will be posted on our WWW home page at
least 30-days in advance of the change.  The purpose for doing
this is to make it more difficult for illegal key owners to
continue downloading shareware versions from various internet
sites and using F/WIN Anti-Virus without paying for it.  We
anticipate that this invalidating of all older key files will
occur about every two years or so.



           DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY AND LIMITED WARRANTY
           ===========================================

The author of F/WIN warrants that:

(a)  the software will perform substantially in accordance with
     the accompanying written materials and

(b)  the software is properly recorded on the disk media. This
     warranty extends for thirty (30) days) from the date of
     purchase.

There is no warranty after expiration of the warranty period.

Neither Stefan Kurtzhals nor anyone else who has been involved in
the creation, production or delivery of the F/WIN Anti-Virus
product and its accompanying files grants any other warranties
with respect to the contents of the software, the written
materials and each specifically disclaims any implied warranties
of merchantability or fitness for any purpose.

Except as stated herein, in no event shall Stefan Kurtzhals or
his suppliers or authorized distributors be liable for any
damages whatsoever, whether direct, indirect, consequential, or
incidental damages (including damages for loss of business
profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or
other pecuniary loss, arising out of the use of or inability to
use such product even if Stefan Kurtzhals, his suppliers or
authorized distributors have been advised of the possibility of
such damages. Because some states do not allow the exclusion of
limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages,
the above limitation may not apply to you.

Stefan Kurtzhals reserves the right to revise the software and
the written materials and to make changes from time to time in
the contents without obligation to notify any person.

All F/WIN Anti-Virus utilities are copyright 1996, Stefan

The F/WIN Anti-Virus package is protected by copyright law,
which applies to the computer software as well, except for that
you may make copies of the software solely for backup or archive

software is used as specified herein.

Making copies of the REGISTERED version of F/WIN Anti-Virus
are also permitted for the purpose of distributing
legal copies of F/WIN Anti-Virus throughout user's organization.

could be made of the original for the purpose of distributing
the original software.  Additionally, legally acquired update
diskettes may also be copied for this purpose.
