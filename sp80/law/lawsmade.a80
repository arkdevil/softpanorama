                             HOW OUR LAWS ARE MADE

I. INTRODUCTION



   This handbook is intended to provide a readable and nontechnical
   outline of the background and the numerous steps of our Federal
   lawmaking process from the origin of an idea for a legislative
   proposal through its publication as a statute. This is a matter about
   which every citizen should be well informed so as to be able to
   understand the everyday news reports and discussions concerning the
   work of Congress.

   It is hoped that this handbook will enable every citizen to gain a
   greater understanding of the Federal legislative process and its role
   as one of the bulwarks of our representative system. One of the most
   practical safeguards of the American democratic way of life is this
   legislative process that, with its emphasis on the protection of the
   minority, gives ample opportunity to all sides to be heard and make
   their views known. The fact that a proposal cannot become a law
   without consideration and approval by both Houses of Congress is an
   outstanding virtue of our legislative system. Open and full discussion
   provided for under our Constitution frequently results in the notable
   improvement of a bill by amendment before it becomes law, or the
   defeat of a bad proposal.

   Because the large majority of laws originate in the House of
   Representatives, this discussion will be directed principally to the
   procedure in that body.

   [70][Return to Table of Contents]

II. THE CONGRESS



   Article I, Section 1, of the United States Constitution, provides
   that:

     All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress
     of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of
     Representatives.



   The Senate is composed of 100 Members--2 from each State, irrespective
   of population or area--elected by the people in conformity with the
   provisions of the 17th Amendment to the Constitution. That amendment
   changed the former Constitutional method under which Senators were
   chosen by the respective State legislatures. A Senator must be at
   least 30 years of age, have been a citizen of the United States for 9
   years, and, when elected, be a resident of the State for which the
   Senator is chosen. The term of office is 6 years and one-third of the
   total membership of the Senate is elected every second year. The terms
   of both Senators from a particular State are so arranged that they do
   not terminate at the same time. Of the 2 Senators from a State serving
   at the same time, the one who was elected first--or if both were
   elected at the same time, the one elected for a full term--is referred
   to as the "senior" Senator from that State. The other is referred to
   as the "junior" Senator. If a Senator dies or resigns during the term,
   the governor of the State must call a special election unless the
   State legislature has authorized the governor to appoint a successor
   until the next election, at which time a successor is elected for the
   balance of the term. Most of the State legislatures have granted their
   governors the power of appointment.

   Each Senator has one vote.

   As constituted in 1989--the 101st Congress--the House of
   Representatives is composed of 435 Members elected every 2 years from
   among the 50 States, apportioned to their total populations. The
   permanent number of 435 was established following the Thirteenth
   Decennial Census in 1910, as directed in Article I, Section 2, of the
   Constitution, and was increased temporarily to 437 for the 87th
   Congress, to provide for one Representative each for Alaska and
   Hawaii. It seems undesirable to make a considerable increase in the
   number of Members, because a larger body, similar to the British House
   of Commons, consisting of 650 members, would be too unwieldy. The
   Constitution limits the number of Representatives to not more than one
   for every 30,000 of population, and, under a former apportionment in
   one State a particular Representative represented more than 900,000
   constituents, while another in the same State was elected from a
   district having a population of only 175,000. The Supreme Court has
   since held unconstitutional a Missouri statute permitting a maximum
   population variance of 3.1 percent from mathematical equality. The
   Court said that the variances among the districts were not unavoidable
   and, therefore, were invalid. This is an interpretation of the Court's
   earlier decision that "as nearly as is practicable one man's vote in a
   Congressional election is to be worth as much as another's"
   [Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U.S. 526 (1969)].

   A law enacted in 1967 abolished all "at-large" elections (that is,
   Representatives elected by the voters of the entire State rather than
   in a Congressional district within the State) except, of course, in
   States entitled to only one Representative.

   A Representative must be at least 25 years of age, have been a citizen
   of the United States for 7 years, and, when elected, be a resident of
   the State in which the Representative is chosen. If a Representative
   dies or resigns during the term, the governor of the State must call a
   special election for the choosing of a successor to serve for the
   unexpired portion of the term.

   Each Representative has one vote.

   In addition to the Representatives from each of the States, there is a
   Resident Commissioner from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and
   Delegates from the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, and the
   Virgin Islands. The Resident Commissioner and the Delegates have most
   of the prerogatives of Representatives, with the important exception
   of the right to vote on matters before the House.

   Under the provisions of Section 2 of the 20th Amendment to the
   Constitution, Congress must assemble at least once every year, at noon
   on the 3d day of January, unless by law they appoint a different day.

   A Congress lasts for 2 years, commencing in January of the year
   following the biennial election of Members, and is divided into 2
   sessions.

   Unlike some other parliamentary bodies, both the Senate and the House
   of Representatives have equal legislative functions and powers (except
   that only the House of Representatives may initiate revenue bills),
   and the designation of one as the "upper" House and the other as the
   "lower" House is not appropriate.

   The Constitution authorizes each House to determine the rules of its
   proceedings. Pursuant to that authority the House of Representatives
   adopts its rules on the opening day of each Congress. The Senate,
   which considers itself a continuing body, operates under standing
   rules that it amends from time to time.

   The chief function of Congress is the making of laws. In addition, the
   Senate has the function of advising and consenting to treaties and to
   certain nominations by the President. In the matter of impeachments,
   the House of Representatives presents the charges--a function similar
   to that of a grand jury--and the Senate sits as a court to try the
   impeachment. Both Houses meet in joint session on the 6th day of
   January, following a presidential election, to count the electoral
   votes. If no candidate receives a majority of the total electoral
   votes, the House of Representatives chooses the President from among
   the 3 candidates having the largest number of votes, and the Senate
   chooses the Vice President from the 2 candidates having the largest
   number of votes for that office.

III. SOURCES OF LEGISLATION



   Sources of ideas for legislation are unlimited, and proposed drafts of
   bills originate in many diverse quarters. First of these is, of
   course, the idea and draft conceived by a Member. This may emanate
   from the election campaign during which the Member had promised to
   introduce legislation on a particular subject, if elected. The entire
   campaign may have been based upon one or more such proposals. Or,
   through experience after taking office the Member may have become
   aware of the need for amendment or repeal of existing laws or the
   enactment of a statute in an entirely new field.

   In addition, the Member's constituents--either as individuals or by
   corporate activity such as citizen groups or associations, bar
   associations, labor unions, manufacturers' associations, and chambers
   of commerce--may avail themselves of the right to petition, which is
   guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution, and transmit
   their proposals to the Member. Many excellent laws have originated in
   this way inasmuch as some of those organizations, because of their
   vital concern with various areas of legislation, have considerable
   knowledge regarding the laws affecting their interests and have the
   services of expert legislative draftsmen at their disposal for this
   purpose. If favorably impressed by the idea, the Member may introduce
   the proposal in the form in which it has been submitted or may first
   redraft it. In all events, the Member may consult with the Legislative
   Counsel of the House or the Senate, as the case may be, to frame the
   ideas in suitable legislative language and form for introduction.

   In modern times the "executive communication" has become a prolific
   source of legislative proposals. This is usually in the form of a
   letter from a member of the President's Cabinet or the head of an
   independent agency--or even from the President--transmitting a draft
   of a proposed bill to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and
   the President of the Senate. Despite the system of separation of
   powers, Article II, Section 3, of the Constitution imposes an
   obligation on the President to report to Congress from time to time on
   the "State of the Union" and to recommend for consideration such
   measures as the President considers necessary and expedient. Many of
   these executive communications follow on the President's message to
   Congress on the State of the Union. The communication is then referred
   to the standing committee having jurisdiction of the subject matter
   embraced in the proposal because a bill may be introduced only by a
   Member of Congress. The Chairman of that committee usually introduces
   the bill promptly either in the form in which it was received or with
   changes the Chairman considers necessary or desirable. This practice
   prevails even when the majority of the House and the President are not
   of the same political party, although there is no constitutional or
   statutory requirement that a bill be introduced to effectuate the
   recommendations. Otherwise, the message may be considered by the
   committee or one of its subcommittees to determine whether a bill
   should be introduced. The most important of the regular executive
   communications is the annual message from the President transmitting
   the proposed budget to Congress. This, together with testimony by
   officials of the various branches of the Government before the
   Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate, is the basis of the
   several appropriation bills that are drafted by the Committee on
   Appropriations of the House.

   Several of the executive departments and independent agencies have
   staffs of trained legislative counsels whose functions include the
   drafting of bills to be forwarded to Congress with a request for their
   enactment.

   The drafting of statutes is an art that requires great skill,
   knowledge, and experience. In some instances a draft is the result of
   a study covering a period of a year or more by a commission or
   committee designated by the President or one of the Cabinet officers.
   The Administrative Procedure Act and the Uniform Code of Military
   Justice are only 2 of many examples of enactments resulting from such
   studies. In addition, Congressional committees sometimes draft bills
   after studies and hearings covering periods of a year or more. Bills
   to codify the laws relating to crimes and criminal procedure, the
   judiciary and judicial procedure, the armed forces, and other
   subjects, have each required several years of preparation.

IV. FORMS OF CONGRESSIONAL ACTION



   The work of Congress is initiated by the introduction of a proposal in
   one of 4 principal forms. These are: the bill, the joint resolution,
   the concurrent resolution, and the simple resolution. By far the most
   customary form used in both Houses is the bill. During the 100th
   Congress (1987-1988), there were introduced in both Houses, 8,515
   bills and 1,073 joint resolutions. Of this number 5,585 bills and 678
   joint resolutions originated in the House of Representatives.

   For the sake of simplicity this discussion will be confined generally
   to the procedure on a House of Representatives bill, but a brief
   comment will be made about each of the forms.

   [73][Return to the Table of Contents]

  BILLS



   A bill is the form used for most legislation, whether permanent or
   temporary, general or special, public or private.

   The form of a House bill is as follows:
                    A BILL


     For the establishment, etc. [as the title may be].

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled, That,  etc.



   The enacting clause was prescribed by law in 1871 and is identical in
   all bills, whether they originate in the House of Representatives or
   in the Senate.

   Bills may originate in either the House of Representatives or the
   Senate, with one notable exception provided for by the Constitution.
   Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution, provides that all bills for
   raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives but
   the Senate may propose or concur with amendments, as on other bills.
   General appropriation bills also originate in the House of
   Representatives.

   There are 2 types of bills--public and private. A public bill is one
   that affects the public generally. A bill of a private character, that
   is, a bill that affects an individual rather than the population at
   large, is called a private bill. A private bill is used for relief in
   matters such as immigration and naturalization and claims by or
   against the United States.

   Article I, Section 8, prescribes the matters concerning which Congress
   may legislate, while Section 9 of the same Article places certain
   limitations on Congressional action.

   A bill originating in the House of Representatives is designated by
   the letters "H.R." followed by a number that it retains throughout all
   its parliamentary stages. The letters signify "House of
   Representatives" and not, as is sometimes supposed, "House
   resolution." A Senate bill is designated by the letter "S." followed
   by its number. The term "companion bill" is used to describe a bill
   introduced in one House of Congress that is similar or identical to a
   bill introduced in the other House of Congress.

   A bill that has been agreed to in identical form by both bodies
   becomes the law of the land only after--
    1. Presidential approval; or
    2. failure by the President to return it with objections to the House
       in which it originated within 10 days while Congress is in
       session; or
    3. the overriding of a Presidential veto by a two-thirds vote in each
       House.



   It does not become law without the President's signature if Congress
   by their adjournment prevent its return with objections. This is known
   as a "pocket veto."

   [74][Return to the Table of Contents]

  JOINT RESOLUTIONS



   Joint resolutions may originate either in the House of Representatives
   or in the Senate--not, as may be supposed, jointly in both Houses.
   There is little practical difference between a bill and a joint
   resolution and, although the latter are not as numerous as bills, the
   2 forms are often used indiscriminately. Statutes that have been
   initiated as bills have later been amended by a joint resolution, and
   vice versa. Both are subject to the same procedure--with the exception
   of a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution. When
   a joint resolution amending the Constitution is approved by two-thirds
   of both Houses, it is sent directly to the Archivist of the United
   States for submission to the several States for ratification. It is
   not presented to the President for approval.

   The form of a House joint resolution is as follows:
               JOINT RESOLUTION

          Authorizing, etc. [as the title may be].

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
That all, etc.



    The resolving clause is identical in both House and Senate joint
   resolutions, having been prescribed by statute in 1871. It is
   frequently preceded by one or more "whereas" clauses indicating the
   necessity for or the desirability of the joint resolution.

   The term "joint" does not signify simultaneous introduction and
   consideration in both Houses.

   A joint resolution originating in the House of Representatives is
   designated "H.J. Res." followed by its individual number which it
   retains throughout all its parliamentary stages. One originating in
   the Senate is designated "S.J. Res." followed by its number.

   Joint resolutions become law in the same manner as bills.

   [75][Return to the Table of Contents]

  CONCURRENT RESOLUTIONS



   Matters affecting the operations of both Houses are usually initiated
   by means of concurrent resolutions. In modern practice, these normally
   are notlegislative in character but are used merely for expressing
   facts, principles, opinions, and purposes of the 2 Houses. They are
   not equivalent to a bill and their use is narrowly limited within
   these bounds.

   The term "concurrent" does not signify simultaneous introduction and
   consideration in both Houses.

   A concurrent resolution originating in the House of Representatives is
   designated "H. Con. Res." followed by its individual number, while a
   Senate concurrent resolution is designated "S. Con. Res." together
   with its number. On approval by both Houses, they are signed by the
   Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate and transmitted to
   the Archivist of the United States for publication in a special part
   of the Statutes at Large volume covering that session of Congress.
   They are not presented to the President for action as in the cases of
   bills and joint resolutions unless they contain a proposition of
   legislation, and that, of course, is not within their scope in their
   modern form.

   [76][Return to the Table of Contents]

  SIMPLE RESOLUTIONS



   A matter concerning the operation of either House alone is initiated
   by a simple resolution. A resolution affecting the House of
   Representatives is designated "H. Res." followed by its number, while
   a Senate resolution is designated "S. Res." together with its number.
   They are considered only by the body in which they were introduced and
   on adoption are attested to by the Clerk of the House of
   Representatives or the Secretary of the Senate, as the case may be,
   and are published in the Congressional Record.

   [77][Return to the Table of Contents]

V. INTRODUCTION AND REFERENCE TO COMMITTEE



   Any Member,the Resident Commissioner, and the Delegates in the House
   of Representatives may introduce a bill at any time while the House is
   actually sitting by simply placing it in the "hopper" provided for the
   purpose at the side of the Clerk's desk in the House Chamber.
   Permission is not required to introduce the measure or to make a
   statement at the time of introduction. Printed blank forms for use in
   typing the original bill are supplied through the Clerk's office. The
   name of the sponsor is endorsed on the bill. A public bill may be
   sponsored by an unlimited number of Members. On request, a Member may
   be added as a sponsor no later than the day the bill is reported to
   the House. (For a discussion of Reported bills", see [78]Part VII.) In
   addition, a Member listed as a sponsor (other than the first sponsor)
   may have the Member's name deleted as a sponsor no later than the day
   the bill is reported to the House. To forestall the possibility that a
   bill might be introduced in the House on behalf of a Member without
   that Member's prior approval, the sponsoring Member's signature must
   appear on the bill before it is accepted for introduction. When there
   are multiple sponsors of a bill, the signature must be that of the
   Member first named thereon. In the Senate, unlimited multiple
   sponsorship of a bill also is permitted. Occasionally, a Member may
   insert the words "by request" after the Member's name to indicate that
   the introduction of the measure is in compliance with the suggestion
   of some other person.

   In the Senate, a Senator usually introduces a bill or resolution by
   presenting it to one of the clerks at the Presiding Officer's desk,
   without commenting on it from the floor of the Senate. However, a
   Senator may use a more formal procedure by rising and introducing the
   bill or resolution from the floor. A Senator usually makes a statement
   about the measure when introducing it on the floor. Frequently,
   Senators obtain consent to have the bill or resolution printed in the
   body of the Congressional Record, following their formal statement.

   If any Senator objects to the introduction of a bill or resolution,
   the introduction of the bill or resolution is postponed until the next
   day. If there is no objection, the bill is read by title and referred
   to the appropriate committee.

   In the House of Representatives it is no longer the custom to read
   bills--even by title--at the time of introduction. The title is
   entered in the Journal and printed in the Congressional Record, thus
   preserving the purpose of the old rule. The bill is assigned its
   legislative number by the Clerk and referred to the appropriate
   committees by the Speaker (the Member elected to be the Presiding
   Officer of the House) with the assistance of the Parliamentarian.
   These details appear in the daily issue of the Congressional Record.
   It is then sent to the Government Printing Office where it is printed
   in its introduced form, and printed copies are available shortly
   thereafter in the document rooms of both Houses.

   One copy is sent to the office of the Chairman of the committee to
   which it has been referred, for action by that committee. The clerk of
   the committee enters it on the committee's Legislative Calendar.

   Perhaps the most important phase of the Congressional process is the
   action by committees. That is where the most intensive consideration
   is given to the proposed measures and where the people are given their
   opportunity to be heard. Nevertheless, this phase where such a
   tremendous volume of hard work is done by the Members is sometimes
   overlooked by the public, particularly when complaining about delays
   in enacting laws. There are, at present, 22 standing committees in the
   House and 16 in the Senate, as well as several select committees. In
   addition, there are several standing joint committees of the 2 Houses.


   Each committee has jurisdiction over certain subject matters of
   legislation and all measures affecting a particular area of the law
   are referred to that committee that has jurisdiction over it. For
   example, the Committee on the Judiciary has jurisdiction over measures
   relating to judicial proceedings (civil and criminal) generally, and
   18 other categories, of which Constitutional amendments, immigration
   and naturalization, bankruptcy, revision and codification of statutes,
   civil liberties, antitrust, patents, copyrights and trademarks, are
   but a few. In all, the rules of the House and of the Senate each
   provide for approximately 200 different classifications of measures
   that are to be referred to committees.

   Membership on the various committees is divided between the 2 major
   political parties. The proportion of the Members of the minority party
   to the Members of the majority party is determined by the majority
   party, except that one-half of the Members on the Committee on
   Standards of Official Conduct are from the majority party and one-half
   from the minority party. The respective party caucuses nominate
   Members of the caucus to be elected to each standing committee at the
   beginning of each Congress. Membership on a standing committee during
   the course of a Congress is contingent on continuing membership in the
   caucus that nominated the Member for election to the committee. If the
   Member ceases to be a Member of the caucus, the Member automatically
   ceases to be a Member of the standing committee.

   A Member may serve on more than one committee. However, the rules of
   the caucus of the majority party in the House provide that the
   Chairmen of certain committees may not serve on another committee and
   that a Member may be Chairman of only one subcommittee of a committee
   or select committee with legislative jurisdiction, excepting certain
   committees performing housekeeping functions and joint committees.

   A Member usually seeks election to the committee that has jurisdiction
   over a field in which the Member is most qualified and interested. For
   example, the Committee on the Judiciary traditionally is composed
   entirely of lawyers. Many Members are nationally recognized experts in
   the specialty of their particular committee or subcommittee.

   Members rank in seniority in accordance with the order of their
   appointment to the committee, and usually the ranking majority Member
   is elected Chairman. The rules of the House require that committee
   Chairmen be elected from nominations submitted by the majority party
   caucus at the commencement of each Congress.

   Most committees have 2 or more subcommittees that, in addition to
   having general jurisdiction, specialize in the consideration of
   particular classifications of bills. Each standing committee of the
   House, except the Committee on the Budget, that has more than 20
   Members must establish at least 4 subcommittees.

   Each committee is provided with a professional and clerical staff to
   assist it in the innumerable administrative details and other problems
   involved in the consideration of bills. For the standing committees,
   the professional staff (consisting of not more than 18, 6 of whom may
   be selected by the minority) is appointed on a permanent basis solely
   on the basis of fitness to perform the duties of their respective
   positions. The clerical staff (consisting of not more than 12, 4 of
   whom may be selected by the minority) is appointed to handle
   correspondence and stenographic work for the committee staff and the
   Chairman and ranking minority Member on matters related to committee
   work. All staff appointments are made by a majority vote of the
   committee without regard to race, creed, sex, or age. The minority
   staff provisions do not apply to the Committee on Standards of
   Official Conduct because of its bipartisan nature. The Committee on
   Appropriations and the Committee on the Budget have special authority
   under the rules of the House for appointment of staff and assistants
   for the minority.

   Under certain conditions, a standing committee may appoint consultants
   on a temporary or intermittent basis and also may provide financial
   assistance to members of its professional staff for the purpose of
   acquiring specialized training, whenever the committee determines that
   such training will aid the committee in the discharge of its
   responsibilities.

VI. CONSIDERATION BY COMMITTEE



   The rules adopted by the caucus of the majority party in the House
   provide that the Chairman of the committee to which a bill has been
   referred must refer the bill to the appropriate subcommittee within 2
   weeks, unless a majority of the Members of the majority party on the
   committee vote to have the bill considered by the full committee. One
   of the first actions taken is the transmittal of copies of the bill to
   the departments and agencies concerned with the subject matter and
   frequently to the General Accounting Office with a request for an
   official report of views on the necessity or desirability of enacting
   the bill into law. Ample time is given for the submission of the
   reports and when received they are accorded serious consideration but
   are not binding on the committee in determining whether or not to act
   favorably on the bill. Reports of the departments and agencies in the
   executive branch are submitted first to the Office of Management and
   Budget to determine whether they are consistent with the program of
   the President.

   [80][Return to the Table of Contents]

  COMMITTEE MEETINGS



   Standing committees are required to have regular meeting days at least
   once a month, but the Chairman may call and convene additional
   meetings. Three or more Members of a standing committee may file with
   the committee a written request that the Chairman call a special
   meeting. The request must specify the measure or matter to be
   considered. If the Chairman fails, within 3 calendar days after the
   filing of the request, to call the requested special meeting, to be
   held within 7 calendar days after the filing of the request, a
   majority of the Members of the committee may call the special meeting
   by filing with the committee written notice specifying the time and
   date of the meeting and the measure or matter to be considered.

   With the exception of the Committees on Appropriations, on the Budget,
   on Rules, on Standards of Official Conduct, on Ways and Means, and on
   House Administration, committees may not, without special permission,
   meet while the House is reading a measure for amendment under the
   "five-minute rule." (See first paragraph under heading [81]"Second
   Reading" in Part XI.) Special permission to meet will be given unless
   10 or more Members object. The rules of the House also provide that
   House committees may not meet during a joint session of the House and
   Senate or during a recess when a joint meeting of the House and Senate
   is in progress. Committees may meet at other times during a recess up
   to the expiration of the constitutional term.

   [82][Return to Table of Contents]

  PUBLIC HEARINGS



   If the bill is of sufficient importance, and particularly if it is
   controversial, the committee will usually set a date for public
   hearings. Each committee (except the Committee on Rules) is required
   to make public announcement of the date, place, and subject matter of
   any hearing to be conducted by the committee on any measure or matter
   at least one week before the commencement of that hearing, unless the
   committee determines that there is good cause to begin the hearing at
   an earlier date. If the committee makes that determination, it must
   make a public announcement to that effect at the earliest possible
   date. Public announcements are published in the Daily Digest portion
   of the Congressional Record as soon as possible after the announcement
   is made by the committee, and are often noted in news papers and
   periodicals. Personal notice, usually in the form of a letter, but
   possibly in the form of a subpoena, is sent frequently to individuals,
   organizations, and Government departments and agencies that are known
   to be interested.

   Each hearing by a committee and subcommittee is required to be open to
   the public except when the committee or subcommittee, in open session
   and with a majority present, determines by rollcall vote that all or
   part of the remainder of the hearing on that day shall be closed to
   the public because disclosure of testimony, evidence, or other matters
   to be considered would endanger the national security or would violate
   a law or a rule of the House. The committee or subcommittee by the
   same procedure may vote to close one subsequent day of hearing, except
   that the Committees on Appropriations and on Armed Services and the
   Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and subcommittees of those
   committees, by the same procedure may vote to close up to 5 additional
   consecutive days of hearings. When a quorum for taking testimony is
   present, a majority of the Members present may close a hearing to
   discuss whether the evidence or testimony to be received would
   endanger national security or would tend to defame, degrade, or
   incriminate any person.

   Hearings on the budget are required to be held by the Committee on
   Appropriations in open session within 30 days after its transmittal to
   Congress, except when the Committee, in open session and with a quorum
   present, determines by rollcall vote that the testimony to be taken at
   that hearing on that day may be related to a matter of national
   security. The Committee may by the same procedure close one subsequent
   day of hearing.

   On the day set for the public hearing an official reporter is present
   to record the testimony in favor of and against the bill. The bill may
   be read in full at the opening of the hearings and a copy is inserted
   in the record. After a brief introductory statement by the Chairman
   and often by the ranking minority Member or other committee Member,
   the first witness is called. Members or Senators who wish to be heard
   are given preference out of courtesy and because of the limitations on
   their time. Cabinet officers and high-ranking civil and military
   officials of the Government, as well as interested private
   individuals, testify either voluntarily or at the request or summons
   of the committee.

   Committees require, so far as practicable, that witnesses who appear
   before it file with the committee, in advance of their appearance, a
   written statement of their proposed testimony and limit their oral
   presentations to a brief summary of their arguments.

   Minority party Members of the committee are entitled to call witnesses
   of their own to testify on a measure during at least one day of the
   hearing.

   All committee rules in the House must provide that each Member shall
   have only 5 minutes in the interrogation of witnesses until each
   Member of the committee who desires to question a witness has had an
   opportunity to do so.

   A typewritten transcript of the testimony taken at a public hearing is
   made available for inspection in the office of the clerk of the
   committee and frequently the complete transcript is printed and
   distributed widely by the committee.

   [83][Return to the Table of Contents]

  BUSINESS MEETINGS



   After hearings are completed, the subcommittee usually will consider
   the bill in a session that is popularly known as the "markup" session.
   The views of both sides are studied in detail and at the conclusion of
   deliberation a vote is taken to determine the action of the
   subcommittee. It may decide to report the bill favorably to the full
   committee, with or without amendment, or unfavorably, or suggest that
   the committee "table" it, that is, postpone action indefinitely. Each
   Member of the subcommittee, regardless of party affiliation, has one
   vote.

   All meetings for the transaction of business, including the markup of
   legislation, of standing committees or subcommittees must be open to
   the public except when the committee or subcommittee, in open session
   with a majority present, determines by rollcall vote that all or part
   of the remainder of the meeting on that day shall be closed to the
   public. This requirement does not apply to any meeting that relates
   solely to internal budget or personnel matters. Members of the
   committee may authorize congressional staff and departmental
   representatives to be present at any business or markup session that
   has been closed to the public.

   [84][Return to the Table of Contents]

  COMMITTEE ACTION



   At committee meetings reports on bills may be made by subcommittees.
   Reports are fully discussed and amendments may be offered. Committee
   amendments are only proposals to change the bill as introduced and are
   subject to acceptance or rejection by the House itself. A vote of
   committee Members is taken to determine whether the full committee
   will report favorably or "table" the bill. If the committee votes to
   report the bill favorably to the House, it may report the bill with or
   without amendments or report a "clean bill." If the committee has
   approved extensive amendments, the committee may decide to report a
   new bill incorporating those amendments, commonly known as a "clean
   bill". The new bill is introduced (usually by the Chairman of the
   committee), and, after referral back to the committee, is reported
   favorably to the House by the committee. Because tabling a bill
   normally is effective in preventing action on it, adverse reports to
   the House by the full committee ordinarily are not made. On rare
   occasions, a committee may report a bill without recommendation or
   unfavorably.

   Generally, a majority of the committee constitutes a quorum, the
   number of Members who must be present in order for the committee to
   act. This ensures adequate participation by both sides in the action
   taken. However, a committee may vary the number of Members necessary
   for a quorum for certain actions. For example, a committee may fix the
   number of its Members, but not less than 2, necessary for a quorum for
   taking testimony and receiving evidence. Except for the Committees on
   Appropriations, on the Budget, and on Ways and Means, a committee may
   fix the number of its Members, but not less than one-third, necessary
   for a quorum for taking certain other actions. The absence of a quorum
   is the subject of a point of order--that is, an objection that the
   proceedings are out of order--that is, that the required number of
   Members is not present.

   [85][Return to the Table of Contents]

  PUBLIC INSPECTION OF RESULTS OF ROLLCALL VOTE IN COMMITTEE



   The result of each rollcall vote in any meeting of a committee must be
   made available by that committee for inspection by the public at
   reasonable times in the offices of that committee. Information
   available for public inspection includes (1) a description of each
   amendment, motion, order, or other proposition, (2) the name of each
   Member voting for and each Member voting against the amendment,
   motion, order, or proposition, and whether by proxy or in person, and
   (3) the names of those Members present but not voting.

   With respect to each rollcall vote by a committee on a motion to
   report a bill or resolution of a public character, the total number of
   votes cast for, and the total number of votes cast against, the
   reporting of the bill or resolution must be included in the committee
   report.

   [86][Return to the Table of Contents]

  PROXY VOTING



   A vote by a Member of a committee with respect to a measure or other
   matter may not be cast by proxy unless that committee adopts a written
   rule that permits voting by proxy and requires that the proxy
   authorization (1) be in writing, (2) assert that the Member is absent
   on official business or is otherwise unable to be present at the
   meeting of the committee, (3) designate the person who is to execute
   the proxy authorization, and (4) be limited to a specific measure or
   matter and any amendments or motions pertaining to the measure or
   matter. A Member may authorize a general proxy only for motions to
   recess, adjourn or other procedural matters. A proxy must be signed by
   the Member and must contain the date and time of day that it is
   signed. A proxy may not be counted for a quorum.

   [87][Return to the Table of Contents]

  POINTS OF ORDER WITH RESPECT TO COMMITTEE PROCEDURE



   A point of order does not lie with respect to a measure reported by a
   committee on the ground that hearings on the measure were not
   conducted in accordance with required committee procedure. However,
   certain points of order may be made by a Member of the committee which
   reported the measure if, in the committee, that point of order was (1)
   timely made and (2) improperly overruled or not properly considered.

   [88][Return to the Table of Contents]

  BROADCASTING COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND MEETINGS



   It is permissible to cover open committee hearings and meetings in the
   House by television, radio, and still photography. This permission is
   granted under well-defined conditions as provided in the rules of the
   House. Similarly, the rules of the Senate permit broadcasting of open
   hearings of a Senate committee under such rules as the committee may
   adopt.

   [89][Return to the Table of Contents]

VII. REPORTED BILLS



   If the committee votes to report the bill favorably to the House, one
   of the Members is designated to write the committee report. The report
   describes the purpose and scope of the bill and the reasons for its
   recommended approval. Generally, a section-by-section analysis is set
   forth in detail explaining precisely what each section is intended to
   accomplish. All changes in existing law must be indicated in the
   report and the text of laws being repealed must be set out. This
   requirement is known as the "Ramseyer" rule; a similar rule in the
   Senate is known as the "Cordon" rule. Committee amendments also must
   be set out at the beginning of the report and explanations of them are
   included. Executive communications regarding the bill usually are
   quoted in full.

   If at the time of approval of a bill by a committee (except the
   Committee on Rules) a Member of the committee gives notice of an
   intention to file supplemental, minority, or additional views, that
   Member is entitled to not less than 3 calendar days (excluding
   Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) in which to file those views
   with the clerk of the committee and they must be included in the
   report on the bill. Committee reports, with certain exceptions, must
   be filed while the House actually is sitting unless unanimous consent
   is obtained from the House to file at a later time.

   The report is assigned a report number when it is filed, and it is
   delivered to the Government Printing Office for printing during that
   night. Beginning with the 91st Congress, in 1969, the report number
   contains a prefix-designator which indicates the number of the
   Congress. For example, the first House report in 1969 was numbered
   91-1.

   The bill is reprinted when reported and committee amendments are
   indicated by showing new matter in italics and deleted matter in
   line-through type. The report number is printed on the bill and the
   calendar number is shown on both the first and back pages of the bill.
   However, in the case of a bill that was referred to 2 or more
   committees for consideration in sequence, the calendar number is
   printed only on the bill as reported by the last committee to consider
   it. See [90]Part IX,"Calendars".

   Committee reports are perhaps the most valuable single element of the
   legislative history of a law. They are used by courts, executive
   departments and agencies, and the public generally, as a source of
   information regarding the purpose and meaning of the law.

   [91][Return to the Table of Contents]

  CONTENTS OF REPORTS



   The report of a committee on a measure that has been approved by the
   committee must include (1) the committee's oversight findings and
   recommendations, (2) the statement required by the Congressional
   Budget Act of 1974, if the measure provides new budget authority
   (other than continuing appropriations), certain new spending
   authority, new credit authority, or an increase or decrease in
   revenues or tax expenditures, (3) the cost estimate and comparison
   prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office whenever
   the Director has submitted that estimate and comparison to the
   committee prior to the filing of the report, and (4) a summary of the
   oversight findings and recommendations made by the Committee on
   Government Operations whenever they have been submitted to the
   legislative committee in a timely fashion to allow an opportunity to
   consider the findings and recommendations during the committee's
   deliberations on the measure. Each of these items are set out
   separately and clearly identified in the report. For a discussion of
   the Congressional budget process, see [92]Part XII. [93][Return to
   Table of Contents]

  INFLATIONARY IMPACT AND COST ESTIMATES IN REPORTS



   In addition, each report of a committee on a bill or joint resolution
   of a public character reported by the committee must contain a
   detailed analytical statement as to whether the enactment of the bill
   or joint resolution into law may have an inflationary impact on prices
   and costs in the operation of the national economy.

   Each report also must contain an estimate, made by the committee, of
   the costs which would be incurred in carrying out that bill or joint
   resolution in the fiscal year reported and in each of the 5 fiscal
   years thereafter or for the duration of the program authorized if less
   than 5 years. In the case of a measure involving revenues, the report
   need contain only an estimate of the gain or loss in revenues for a
   one-year period. The report must include a comparison of the estimates
   of those costs with the estimate made by any Government agency and
   submitted to that committee. The Committees on Appropriations, on
   House Administration, on Rules, and on Standards of Official Conduct
   are not required to include cost estimates in their reports. In
   addition, the cost estimates are not required to be included in
   reports when a cost estimate and comparison prepared by the Director
   of the Congressional Budget Office has been submitted prior to the
   filing of the report and included in the report.

   [94][Return to the Table of Contents]

  FILING OF REPORTS



   Measures approved by a committee must be reported promptly after
   approval. A majority of the Members of the committee may file a
   written request with the clerk of the committee for the reporting of
   the measure. When the request is filed, the clerk immediately must
   notify the Chairman of the committee of the filing of the request, and
   the report on the measure must be filed within 7 days (excluding days
   on which the House is not in session) after the day on which the
   request is filed. This does not apply to a report of the Committee on
   Rules with respect to the rules, joint rules, or order of business of
   the House or to the reporting of a resolution of inquiry addressed to
   the head of an executive department.

   [95][Return to the Table of Contents]

  AVAILABILITY OF REPORTS AND HEARINGS



   With certain exceptions (relating to emergency situations, such as a
   measure declaring war or other national emergency and Government
   agency decisions, determinations, and actions that are effective
   unless disapproved or otherwise invalidated by one or both Houses of
   Congress), a measure or matter reported by a committee (except the
   Committee on Rules in the case of a resolution making in order the
   consideration of a bill, resolution, or other order of business) may
   not be considered in the House until the third calendar day (excluding
   Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) on which the report of that
   committee on that measure has been available to the Members of the
   House. In addition, the measure or matter may not be considered unless
   copies of the report and the reported measure or matter have been
   available to the Members for at least 3 calendar days (excluding
   Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays during which the House is not
   in session) before the beginning of consideration. However, it is
   always in order to consider a report from the Committee on Rules
   specifically providing for the consideration of a reported measure or
   matter notwithstanding this restriction. If hearings were held on a
   measure or matter so reported, the committee is required to make every
   reasonable effort to have those hearings printed and available for
   distribution to the Members of the House prior to the consideration of
   the measure in the House. General appropriation bills may not be
   considered until printed committee hearings and a committee report
   thereon have been available to the Members of the House for at least 3
   calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays).

   [96][Return to the Table of Contents]

VIII. LEGISLATIVE REVIEW BY STANDING COMMITTEES



   Each standing committee (other than the Committees on Appropriations
   and on the Budget) is required to review and study, on a continuing
   basis, the application, administration, execution, and effectiveness
   of the laws dealing with the subject matter over which the committee
   has jurisdiction and the organization and operation of Federal
   agencies and entities having responsibility for the administration and
   evaluation of those laws.

   The purpose of the review and study is to determine whether laws and
   the programs created by Congress are being implemented and carried out
   in accordance with the intent of Congress and whether those programs
   should be continued, curtailed, or eliminated. In addition, each
   committee having oversight responsibility is required to review and
   study any conditions or circumstances that may indicate the necessity
   or desirability of enacting new or additional legislation within the
   jurisdiction of that committee, and must undertake, on a continuing
   basis, futures research and forecasting on matters within the
   jurisdiction of that committee. Each standing committee also has the
   function of reviewing and studying, on a continuing basis, the impact
   or probable impact of tax policies on subjects within its
   jurisdiction.

   In addition, several of the standing committees have special oversight
   responsibilities, the details of which are contained in the rules of
   the House.

   [97][Return to the Table of Contents]

IX. CALENDARS



   The House of Representatives has 5 calendars of business: the Union
   Calendar, the House Calendar, the Private Calendar, the Consent
   Calendar, and the Calendar of Motions to Discharge Committees. The
   calendars, together with a listing of all bills introduced and a
   history of all bills reported out of committee in the current
   Congress, are printed each day the House is in session to provide
   information on the status of pending legislation.

   As soon as a public bill is favorably reported, it is assigned a
   calendar number on either the Union Calendar or the House Calendar,
   the 2 principal calendars of business. The calendar number is printed
   on the first page of the bill and, in certain instances, is printed
   also on the back page. In the case of a bill that was referred to 2 or
   more committees for consideration in sequence, the calendar number is
   printed only on the bill as reported by the last committee to consider
   it.

   [98][Return to the Table of Contents]

  UNION CALENDAR



   The rules of the House provide that there shall be:

     First. A Calendar of the Committee of the Whole House on the state
     of the Union, to which shall be referred bills raising revenue,
     general appropriation bills, and bills of a public character
     directly or indirectly appropriating money or property.



   This is commonly known as the Union Calendar and the large majority of
   public bills and resolutions are placed on it on being reported to the
   House. For a discussion of the Committee of the Whole House, see
   [99]Part XI.

   [100][Return to the Table of Contents]

  HOUSE CALENDAR



   The rules further provide that there shall be:

     Second. A House Calendar, to which shall be referred all bills of a
     public character not raising revenue nor directly or indirectly
     appropriating money or property.



   The public bills and resolutions that are not placed on the Union
   Calendar are referred to the House Calendar.

   [101][Return to the Table of Contents]

  PRIVATE CALENDAR



   The rules also provide that there shall be:

     Third. A Calendar of the Committee of the Whole House, to which
     shall be referred all bills of a private character.



    This is commonly known as the Private Calendar and all private bills
   are placed on it on being reported to the House. The Private Calendar
   is called on the first and third Tuesdays of each month. If objection
   is made by 2 or more Members to the consideration of any measure
   called, it is recommitted to the committee that reported it. As in the
   case of the Consent Calendar [102](see below) there are 6 official
   objectors, 3 on the majority side and 3 on the minority side, who make
   a careful study of each bill or resolution on the Private Calendar and
   who will object to a measure that does not conform to the requirements
   for that calendar, thereby preventing the passage without debate of
   nonmeritorious bills and resolutions.

   [103][Return to the Table of Contents]

  CONSENT CALENDAR



   If a measure pending on either the House or Union Calendar is of a
   noncontroversial nature, it may be placed on the Consent Calendar.
   After a bill has been favorably reported and is on either the House or
   Union Calendar, any Member may file with the Clerk a notice that the
   Member desires the bill placed on the Consent Calendar. On the first
   and third Mondays of each month immediately after the reading of the
   Journal, the Speaker directs the Clerk to call the bills in numerical
   order (that is, in the order of their appearance on that calendar)
   that have been on the Consent Calendar for 3 legislative days. If
   objection is made to the consideration of any bill so called, it is
   carried over on the calendar without prejudice to the next day when
   the Consent Calendar is again called, and if then objected to by 3 or
   more Members it is immediately stricken from the calendar and may not
   be placed on the Consent Calendar again during that session of
   Congress. If objection is not made and if the bill is not "passed
   over" by request, it is passed by unanimous consent without debate.
   Ordinarily, the only amendments considered are those sponsored by the
   committee that reported the bill.

   To avoid the passage without debate of measures that may be
   controversial or are sufficiently important or complex to require full
   discussion, there are 6 official objectors--3 on the majority side and
   3 on the minority side--who make a careful study of bills on the
   Consent Calendar. If a bill involves the expenditure of more than a
   fixed maximum amount of money or if it changes national policy or has
   other aspects that any of the objectors believes demand explanation
   and extended debate, it will be objected to and will not be passed by
   unanimous consent. That action does not necessarily mean the final
   defeat of the bill because it may then be brought up for consideration
   in the same way as any other bill on the House or Union Calendars.

  CALENDAR OF MOTIONS TO DISCHARGE COMMITTEES



   When a majority of the Members of the House sign a motion to discharge
   a committee from consideration of a public bill or resolution, that
   motion is referred to the Calendar of Motions to Discharge Committees.
   For a further discussion of Motions to Discharge, see [105]"Motion to
   Discharge Committee" in Part X.

   [106][Return to the Table of Contents]

X. OBTAINING CONSIDERATION OF MEASURES



   Obviously certain measures pending on the House and Union Calendars
   are more important and urgent than others and it is necessary to have
   a system permitting their consideration ahead of those that do not
   require immediate action. Because all measures are placed on those
   calendars in the order in which they are reported to the House, the
   latest bill reported would be the last to be taken up if the calendar
   number alone were the determining factor.

   [107][Return to the Table of Contents]

  SPECIAL RESOLUTIONS



   To avoid delays and to provide some degree of selectivity in the
   consideration of measures, it is possible to have them taken up out of
   order by obtaining from the Committee on Rules a special resolution or
   "rule" for their consideration. That Committee, which is composed of
   majority and minority Members but with a larger proportion of majority
   Members than other committees, is specifically granted jurisdiction
   over resolutions relating to the order of business of the House.
   Usually the Chairman of the committee that has favorably reported the
   bill appears before the Committee on Rules accompanied by the sponsor
   of the measure and one or more Members of the Chairman's committee in
   support of the request for a resolution providing for its immediate
   consideration. If the Committee on Rules is satisfied that the measure
   should be taken up it will report a resolution reading substantially
   as follows with respect to a bill on the Union Calendar:

     Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be in
     order to move that the House resolve itself into the Committee of
     the Whole House on the State of the Union for the consideration of
     the bill (H.R. ___) entitled, etc., and the first reading of the
     bill shall be dispensed with. After general debate, which shall be
     confined to the bill and shall continue not to exceed __ hours, to
     be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking
     minority member of the Committee on ___, the bill shall be read for
     amendment under the five-minute rule. At the conclusion of the
     consideration of the bill for amendment, the Committee shall rise
     and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have
     been adopted, and the previous question shall be considered as
     ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without
     intervening motion except one motion to recommit.



   If the measure is on the House Calendar the resolution reads
   substantially as follows:

     Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be in
     order to consider the bill (H.R. ___) entitled, etc., in the House.



   The resolution may waive points of order against the bill. When it
   limits or prevents floor amendments, it is popularly known as a
   "closed rule".

   [108][Return to the Table of Contents]

  CONSIDERATION OF MEASURES MADE IN ORDER BY PREVIOUS RESOLUTION



   When a "rule" has been reported to the House, and is not considered
   immediately, it is referred to the calendar and, if not called up for
   consideration by the Member making the report within 7 legislative
   days thereafter, any Member of the Committee on Rules may call it up
   as a question of privilege (after having given one calendar day notice
   of the Member's intention to do so) and the Speaker will recognize any
   Member of the Committee seeking recognition for that purpose. For a
   discussion of privileged questions, see the matter under the heading
   [109]"Privileged Matters" at the end of this part.

   If, within 7 calendar days after a measure has, by resolution, been
   made in order for consideration by the House, a motion has not been
   offered for its consideration, the Speaker may recognize a Member of
   the committee that reported the measure to offer a motion that the
   House consider it, if the Member has been duly authorized by that
   committee to offer the motion.

   There are several other methods of obtaining consideration of bills
   that either have not been reported by a committee or, if reported, for
   which a special resolution or "rule" has not been obtained. Two of
   those methods, a motion to discharge a committee and a motion to
   suspend the rules, are discussed below.

   [110][Return to the Table of Contents]

  MOTION TO DISCHARGE COMMITTEE



   A Member may present to the Clerk a motion in writing to discharge a
   committee from the consideration of a public bill or resolution that
   has been referred to it 30 days prior thereto. A Member also may file
   a motion to discharge the Committee on Rules from further
   consideration of a resolution providing either a special order of
   business, or a special rule for the consideration of a public bill or
   resolution favorably reported by a standing committee, or a special
   rule for the consideration of a public bill or resolution that has
   remained in a standing committee 30 days or more without action. This
   motion may be made only when the resolution, from which it is moved to
   discharge the Committee on Rules, has been referred to that committee
   at least 7 days prior to the filing of the motion to discharge. The
   motion is placed in the custody of the Clerk, who arranges some
   convenient place for the signature of Members. When a majority of the
   total membership of the House have signed the motion, it is entered on
   the Journal, printed with the signatures thereto in the Congressional
   Record, and referred to the Calendar of Motions to Discharge
   Committees.

   On the second and fourth Mondays of each month, except during the last
   6 days of a session, a Member who has signed a motion to discharge,
   that has been on the calendar at least 7 days, may seek recognition
   and be recognized for the purpose of calling up the motion. The bill
   or resolution is then read by title only. After 20 minutes' debate,
   one-half in favor of the proposition and one-half in opposition, the
   House proceeds to vote on the motion to discharge.

   If the motion to discharge the Committee on Rules from a resolution
   pending before the Committee prevails, the House immediately votes on
   the adoption of that resolution.

   If the motion to discharge one of the standing committees of the House
   from a public bill or resolution pending before the committee
   prevails, a Member who signed the motion may move that the House
   proceed to the immediate consideration of the bill or resolution. If
   the motion is agreed to, the bill or resolution is considered
   immediately under the general rules of the House. If the House votes
   against the motion for immediate consideration, the bill or resolution
   is referred to its proper calendar with the same rights and privileges
   it would have had if reported favorably by the standing committee.

   [111][Return to the Table of Contents]

  MOTION TO SUSPEND THE RULES



   On Monday and Tuesday of each week and during the last 6 days of a
   session, the Speaker may entertain a motion to suspend the rules of
   the House and pass a bill or resolution. Arrangement must be made in
   advance with the Speaker to recognize the Member who wishes to offer
   the motion. Before being considered by the House, the motion must be
   seconded by a majority of the Members present, by teller vote, if
   demanded. However, a second is not required on a motion to suspend the
   rules when printed copies of the proposed bill or resolution have been
   available for one legislative day before the motion is considered. The
   motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill is then debated for 40
   minutes, one-half by those in favor of the proposition and one-half by
   those opposed. The motion may not be amended and if amendments to the
   bill are proposed they must be included in the motion when it is made.
   The rules may be suspended and the bill passed only by affirmative
   vote of two-thirds of the Members voting, a quorum being present.

   The Speaker may postpone all recorded and yea-nay votes on motions to
   suspend the rules and pass bills and resolutions until the end of that
   legislative day or the next 2 legislative days. At that time the House
   disposes of the deferred votes consecutively without further debate.
   After the first deferred vote is taken, the Speaker may reduce to not
   less than 5 minutes the time period for subsequent deferred votes. If
   the House adjourns before completing action on one or more deferred
   votes, these must be the first order of business on the next
   legislative day. By eliminating intermittent recorded votes on
   suspensions, this procedure reduces interruptions of committee
   meetings and also reduces the time Members spend on suspension days
   going back and forth between the floor and their committee rooms or
   offices.

   [112][Return to the Table of Contents]

  CALENDAR WEDNESDAY



   On Wednesday of each week, unless dispensed with by unanimous consent
   or by affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Members voting, a quorum
   being present, the standing committees are called in alphabetical
   order. A committee when named may call up for consideration any bill
   reported by it on a previous day and pending on either the House or
   Union Calendar. Not more than 2 hours of general debate is permitted
   on any measure called up on Calendar Wednesday and all debate must be
   confined to the subject matter of the measure, the time being equally
   divided between those for and those against it. The affirmative vote
   of a simple majority of the Members present is sufficient to pass the
   measure.

   [113][Return to the Table of Contents]

  DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA BUSINESS



   The second and fourth Mondays in each month, after the disposition of
   motions to discharge committees and after the disposal of business on
   the Speaker's table requiring only referral to committee, are set
   aside, when claimed by the Committee on the District of Columbia, for
   the consideration of any business that is presented by that Committee.


   [114][Return to the Table of Contents]

  PRIVILEGED MATTERS



   Under the rules of the House certain matters are regarded as
   privileged matters and may interrupt the order of business, for
   example, reports from the Committee on Rules and reports from the
   Committee on Appropriations on the general appropriation bills.

   At any time after the reading of the Journal, a Member, by direction
   of the appropriate committee, may move that the House resolve itself
   into the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for
   the purpose of considering bills raising revenues, or general
   appropriation bills. General appropriation bills may not be considered
   in the House until 3 calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and
   legal holidays) after printed committee reports and hearings on them
   have been available to the Members. The limit on general debate is
   generally fixed by unanimous consent.

   Other examples of privileged matters are conference reports, certain
   amendments to measures by the Senate, veto messages from the President
   of the United States, and resolutions privileged pursuant to statute.
   The Member in charge of such a matter may call it up at practically
   any time for immediate consideration. Usually, this is done after
   consultation with both the majority and minority floor leaders so that
   the Members of both parties will have advance notice and will not be
   taken by surprise.

   [115][Return to the Table of Contents]

XI. CONSIDERATION



   Our democratic tradition demands that bills be given consideration by
   the entire membership with adequate opportunity for debate and the
   proposing of amendments.

   [116][Return to the Table of Contents]

  COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE HOUSE



   In order to expedite the consideration of bills and resolutions, the
   rules of the House provide for a parliamentary usage that enables the
   House to act with a quorum of less than the requisite majority of 218.
   The House resolves itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the
   State of the Union (a quorum of which consists of 100 Members) to
   consider a measure. All measures on the Union Calendar--involving a
   tax, making appropriations, or authorizing payments out of
   appropriations already made--must be first considered in the Committee
   of the Whole.

   The Committee on Rules reports a special resolution or "rule" allowing
   for immediate consideration of a measure by the Committee of the
   Whole. After adoption of the resolution by the House, the House votes
   on a motion to resolve itself into the Committee of the Whole or, in
   certain situations, the Speaker declares the House resolved into the
   Committee of the Whole without intervening motion. When the House
   resolves into the Committee of the Whole, the Speaker leaves the chair
   after appointing a Chairman to preside.

   The special resolution or "rule" referred to in the preceding
   paragraph also fixes the length of the debate in the Committee of the
   Whole. This may vary according to the importance and controversial
   nature of the measure. As provided in the resolution, the control of
   the time is divided equally--usually between the Chairman and the
   ranking minority Member of the committee that reported the measure.
   Members seeking to speak for or against the measure usually arrange in
   advance with the Member in control of the time on their respective
   side to be allowed a certain amount of time in the debate. Others may
   ask the Member speaking at the time to yield to them for a question or
   a brief statement. A transcript of the proceedings and debate in the
   House and the Senate is printed daily in the Congressional Record.

   Frequently permission is granted a Member by unanimous consent to
   extend the Member's remarks in the Congressional Record if sufficient
   time to make a lengthy oral statement is not available during actual
   debate.

   The conduct of the debate is governed principally by the rules of the
   House that are adopted at the opening of each Congress. Another
   recognized authority is Jefferson's Manual that was prepared by Thomas
   Jefferson for his own guidance as President of the Senate from 1797 to
   1801. The House, in 1837, adopted a rule that still stands, providing
   that the provisions of Jefferson's Manual should govern the House in
   all cases to which they are applicable and in which they are not
   inconsistent with the rules and orders of the House. In addition,
   there is a most valuable compilation of precedents up to the year 1935
   set out in Hinds' Precedents and Cannon's Precedents of the House of
   Representatives, consisting of 11 volumes, to guide the action of the
   House. A later compilation, Deschler's Precedents of the House of
   Representatives, covers years 1936 to date. Summaries of the House
   precedents prior to 1959 can be found in a single volume entitled
   Cannon's Procedure in the House of Representatives. A later volume,
   Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, fourth edition, as
   supplemented, is a compilation of the parliamentary precedents of the
   House, in summary form, together with other useful related material,
   from 1959 to date. Also, various rulings of the Speaker since 1931 are
   set out as notes to the current House Rules and Manual. Most
   parliamentary questions arising during the course of debate are
   susceptible of ruling backed up by a precedent of action in a similar
   situation. The Parliamentarian of the House is present in the House
   Chamber in order to assist the Chairman or the Speaker in making a
   correct ruling on parliamentary questions.

   [117][Return to the Table of Contents]

  SECOND READING



   During the general debate an accurate account is kept of the time used
   on both sides and when all the time allowed under the rule has been
   consumed the Chairman terminates the debate. Then begins the "second
   reading of the bill", section by section, at which time amendments may
   be offered to a section when it is read. A Member is permitted 5
   minutes to explain the proposed amendment, after which the Member who
   is first recognized by the Chair is allowed to speak for 5 minutes in
   opposition to it; there is no further debate on that amendment,
   thereby effectively preventing any attempt at filibuster tactics. This
   is known as the "five-minute rule." There is, how ever, a device
   whereby a Member may offer a pro forma amendment--"to strike out the
   last word"--without intending any change in the language, and be
   allowed 5 minutes for debate, thus permitting a somewhat more
   comprehensive debate. Each amendment is put to the Committee of the
   Whole for adoption. Generally, a pro forma amendment is withdrawn.
   However, in the absence of being withdrawn, it must be voted on.

   At any time after a debate is begun under the five-minute rule, on
   proposed amendments to a section or paragraph of a bill, the Committee
   of the Whole may by majority vote of the Members present, close debate
   on the section or paragraph. However, if debate is closed on a section
   or paragraph before there has been debate on any amendment that a
   Member has caused to be printed in the Congressional Record after the
   reporting of the bill by the committee but at least one day prior to
   floor consideration of the amendment, the Member who caused the
   amendment to be printed in the Record is given 5 minutes in which to
   explain the amendment, after which the first person to obtain the
   floor has 5 minutes to speak in opposition to it, and there is no
   further debate on that proposed amendment. However, time for debate is
   not allowed when the offering of the amendment is dilatory. Material
   placed in the Congressional Record must indicate the full text of the
   proposed amendment, the name of the proponent Member, the number of
   the bill to which it will be offered and the point in the bill or
   amendment thereto where the amendment is intended to be offered, and
   must appear in a portion of the Record designated for that purpose.

   When an amendment is offered, while the House is meeting in the
   Committee of the Whole, the Clerk is required to transmit 5 copies of
   the amendment to the majority committee table, 5 copies to the
   minority committee table, and at least one copy each to the majority
   and minority cloak rooms.

   [118][Return to the Table of Contents]

  THE COMMITTEE "RISES"



   At the conclusion of the consideration of a bill for amendment, the
   Committee of the Whole "rises" and reports the bill to the House with
   the amendments that have been adopted. In rising the Committee of the
   Whole reverts back to the House and the Chairman of the Committee is
   replaced in the chair by the Speaker of the House. The House then acts
   on the bill and any amendments adopted by the Committee of the Whole.

   [119][Return to the Table of Contents]

  HOUSE ACTION



   Debate is cut off by moving "the previous question." If this motion is
   carried by a majority of the Members voting, a quorum being present,
   all debate is cut off on the bill on which the previous question has
   been ordered. The Speaker then puts the question: "Shall the bill be
   engrossed and read a third time?" If this question is decided in the
   affirmative, the bill is read a third time by title only and voted on
   for passage.

   If the previous question has been ordered by the terms of the special
   resolution or "rule" on a bill reported by the Committee of the Whole,
   the House immediately votes on whatever amendments have been reported
   by the Committee in the sequence in which they were reported. After
   completion of voting on the amendments, the House immediately votes on
   the passage of the bill with the amendments it has adopted.

   In those cases where the previous question has not been ordered, the
   House may engage in debate lasting one hour, at the conclusion of
   which the previous question is ordered and the House votes on the
   passage of the bill. During the debate it is in order to offer
   amendments to the bill or to the Committee amendments.

   The Speaker may postpone a vote on final passage of a bill or
   resolution or agreement to a conference report. A vote may be
   postponed for up to 2 legislative days.

   Measures that do not have to be considered in the Committee of the
   Whole are considered in the House in the first instance under the hour
   rule or in accordance with the terms of the special resolution
   limiting debate on the measure.

   After passage of the bill by the House, a pro forma motion to
   reconsider it is automatically made and laid on the table--that is,
   action is postponed indefinitely--to forestall this motion at a later
   date, because the vote of the House on a proposition is not final and
   conclusive on the House until there has been an opportunity to
   reconsider it.

   [120][Return to the Table of Contents]

  MOTIONS TO RECOMMIT



   After the previous question has been ordered on the passage of a bill
   or joint resolution, it is in order to make one motion to recommit the
   bill or joint resolution to a committee and the Speaker is required to
   give preference in recognition for that purpose to a Member who is
   opposed to the bill or joint resolution. This motion is normally not
   subject to debate. However, with respect to a motion to recommit with
   instructions after the previous question has been ordered, it is in
   order to debate the motion for 10 minutes before the vote is taken,
   except that the majority floor manager may demand that the debate be
   extended to one hour. Whatever time is allotted for debate is divided
   equally between the proponents and opponents of the motion.

   [121][Return to the Table of Contents]

  QUORUM CALLS AND ROLLCALLS



   In order to speed up and expedite quorum calls and rollcalls, the
   rules of the House provide alternative methods for pursuing these
   procedures.

   In the absence of a quorum, 15 Members, including the Speaker, if
   there is one, are authorized to compel the attendance of absent
   Members. Such a call of the House is ordered by a majority vote, and a
   minority of 15 or more favoring a call is not sufficient. A call of
   the House is then ordered, and the Speaker is required to have the
   call taken by electronic device. However, the Speaker instead may name
   one or more clerks "to tell" the Members who are present. In that case
   the names of those present are recorded by the clerks, and entered in
   the Journal of the House and absent Members have not less than 15
   minutes from the ordering of the call of the House to have their
   presence recorded. If sufficient excuse is not offered for their
   absence, by order of a majority of those present, they may be sent for
   by officers appointed by the Sergeant-at-Arms for that purpose, and
   their attendance secured and retained. The House then determines the
   conditions on which they may be discharged. Members who voluntarily
   appear are, unless the House otherwise directs, immediately admitted
   to the Hall of the House and they must report their names to the Clerk
   to be entered on the Journal as present. However, the former practice
   of presenting Members at the Bar of the House, during a call, is now
   obsolete, and Members now report to the Clerk and are recorded without
   being formally excused unless brought in under compulsion.

   Whenever a quorum fails to vote on any question, and a quorum is not
   present and objection is made for that reason, there is a call of the
   House unless the House adjourns. The call is taken by electronic
   device unless the Speaker orders the call in the manner described in
   the preceding paragraph, and the Sergeant-at-Arms proceeds to bring in
   absent Members. The yeas and nays on the pending question are at the
   same time considered as ordered and an automatic rollcall vote is
   taken. The Clerk calls the roll and each Member who is present may
   vote on the pending question as the Member answers the roll. After the
   rollcall is completed, each Member, whose attendance was secured, is
   brought before the House by the Sergeant-at-Arms, where the Member's
   presence is noted. The Member then is given an opportunity to vote. If
   those voting on the question and those who are present and decline to
   vote together make a majority of the House, the Speaker declares that
   a quorum is constituted, and the pending question is decided according
   to the will of the majority of those voting. Further proceedings under
   the call are considered as dispensed with. At any time after the
   rollcall has been completed, the Speaker may entertain a motion to
   adjourn, if seconded by a majority of those present as ascertained by
   actual count by the Speaker; and if the House adjourns, all quorum
   call proceedings are vacated.

   The rules prohibit points of no quorum (1) before or during the daily
   prayer, (2) during administration of the oath of office to the Speaker
   or any Member, (3) during the reception of messages from the President
   or the Senate, (4) in connection with motions incidental to a call of
   the House, and (5) against a vote in which the Committee of the Whole
   agrees to rise (but an appropriate point of no quorum would be
   permitted against a vote defeating a motion to rise). If the presence
   of a quorum has been established at least once on any day, further
   points of no quorum are prohibited (1) during the reading of the
   Journal, (2) between the time a Committee of the Whole rises and its
   Chairman reports, and (3) during the period on any legislative day
   when Members are addressing the House under special orders. The
   language prohibiting quorum calls "during any period" when Members are
   speaking under special orders includes the time between addresses
   delivered during this period as well as the addresses themselves.
   Furthermore, a quorum call is not in order when no business has
   intervened since the previous call. For the purposes of this
   provision, all the situations described above are not to be considered
   as "business."

   The rules prohibit points of no quorum when a motion or proposition is
   pending in the House unless the Speaker has put the motion or
   proposition to a vote. However, the Speaker has the discretion to
   recognize a Member of the Speaker's choice to move a call of the
   House.

   The first time the Committee of the Whole finds itself without a
   quorum during any day the Chairman is required to order the roll to be
   called by electronic device, unless the Chairman orders a call by
   naming clerks "to tell" the Members as described above. However, the
   Chairman may refuse to entertain a point of order that a quorum is not
   present during general debate. If on a call a quorum appears, the
   Committee continues its business. If a quorum does not appear, the
   Committee rises and the Chairman reports the names of the absentees to
   the House. The rules provide for the expeditious conduct of quorum
   calls in the Committee of the Whole. The Chairman may suspend a quorum
   call after determining that a bare or minimum quorum has been reached,
   that is, 100 or more Members. Under such a short quorum call the
   Committee will not rise, and therefore Members' names will not be
   published. Once the presence of a quorum of the Committee of the Whole
   has been established for the day, quorum calls in the Committee are
   only in order when the Committee is operating under the five-minute
   rule and the Chairman has put the pending motion or proposition to a
   vote.

   [122][Return to the Table of Contents]

  VOTING



   There are 4 methods of voting in the Committee of the Whole, that are
   also employed, together with an additional method, in the House. These
   are the voice vote (viva voce), the division, the teller vote, the
   recorded vote, and the yea-and-nay vote that is used only in the
   House. If a Member objects to the vote on the ground that a quorum is
   not present in the House, there may be an automatic rollcall vote.

   To obtain a voice vote the Chair states "As many as are in favor (as
   the question may be) say `Aye'." "As many as are opposed, say `No'."
   The Chair determines the result on the basis of the volume of ayes and
   noes. This is the form in which the vote is ordinarily taken in the
   first instance.

   If it is difficult to determine the result of a voice vote, a division
   may be demanded. The Chair then states that a division has been
   demanded and says "As many as are in favor will rise and stand until
   counted." After counting those in favor he calls on those opposed to
   stand and be counted, thereby determining the number in favor of and
   those opposed to the question.

   If a demand for a teller vote is supported by one-fifth of a quorum
   (20 in the Committee of the Whole, and 44 in the House), the Chair
   appoints one or more tellers from each side and directs the Members in
   favor of the proposition to pass between the tellers and be counted.
   After counting, a teller announces the number in the affirmative, and
   the Chair then directs the Members opposed to pass between the tellers
   and be counted. When the count is stated by a teller, the Chair
   announces the result.

   If any Member requests a recorded vote and that request is supported
   by at least one-fifth of a quorum of the House, or 25 Members in the
   Committee of the Whole, the vote is taken by electronic device, unless
   the Speaker orders clerks "to tell," that is, record the names of
   those voting on each side of the question. After the recorded vote is
   concluded, the names of those voting together with those not voting
   are entered in the Journal. Members usually have 15 minutes to be
   counted from the time the recorded vote is ordered or the ordering of
   the clerks "to tell" the vote. The Speaker may reduce the period for
   voting to 5 minutes in certain situations.

   In addition to the foregoing methods of voting, in the House, if the
   yeas and nays are demanded, the Speaker directs those in favor of
   taking the vote by that method to stand and be counted. The assent of
   one-fifth of the Members present (as distinguished from one-fifth of a
   quorum in the case of a demand for tellers) is necessary for ordering
   the yeas and nays. When the yeas and nays are ordered (or a point of
   order is made that a quorum is not present) the Speaker directs that
   as many as are in favor of the proposition will, as their names are
   called, answer "Aye"; as many as are opposed will answer "No." The
   Clerk calls the roll and reports the result to the Speaker who
   announces it to the House. The Speaker is not required to vote unless
   the Speaker's vote would be decisive.

   The rules prohibit a Member from (1) casting another Member's vote or
   recording another Member's presence in the House or the Committee of
   the Whole or (2) authorizing another individual to cast a vote or
   record the Member's presence in the House or the Committee of the
   Whole.

  ELECTRONIC VOTING



   Recorded and rollcall votes are usually taken by electronic device,
   except when the Speaker orders the vote to be recorded by other
   methods prescribed by the rules of the House, and in emergency
   situations, such as, the failure of the electronic device to function.
   In addition, quorum calls are generally taken by electronic device.
   Essentially the system works as follows: A number of vote stations are
   attached to selected chairs in the Chamber. Each station is equipped
   with a vote card slot and 4 indicators, marked "yea," "nay,"
   "present," and "open." The "open" indicator is used only when a vote
   period is in progress and the system is ready to accept votes. Each
   Member is provided with a personalized Vote 09ID Card. A Member votes
   by inserting the voting card into any one of the vote stations and
   depressing the appropriate push button to indicate the Member's
   choice. The machine records the votes and reports the result when the
   vote is completed. In the event the Member is without a Vote 09ID
   Card, the Member may still vote by handing a paper ballot to the Tally
   Clerk, who may then record the vote electronically according to the
   indicated preference of the Member. The paper ballots are green for
   "yea," red for "nay," and amber for "present."

   [124][Return to the Table of Contents]

  PAIRING OF MEMBERS



   When a Member anticipates being unavoidably absent at the time a vote
   is to be taken, the Member may arrange in advance to be recorded as
   being either in favor of, or opposed to, the question by being
   "paired" with a Member who will also be absent and who holds contrary
   views on the question. A specific pair of this kind shows how the
   Member would have voted if present. Occasionally, a Member who has
   arranged in advance to be paired, actually is present at the time of
   voting. The Member then votes as if not paired, and subsequently
   withdraws that vote and asks to be marked "present" to protect the
   other Member. This is known as a "live pair". If the absence is to
   continue for several days during which a number of different questions
   are to be voted upon, the Member may arrange a "general pair." A
   general pair does not indicate how the Member would have voted on the
   question, but merely that the paired Members would not have been on
   the same side of the question.

   Pairs are not counted in determining the vote on the question, but,
   rather, provide an opportunity for absent Members to express formally
   how they would have voted had they been present. Pairs are announced
   by the Clerk of the House and are listed in the Congressional Record
   immediately after the names of those Members not voting on the
   question.

  SYSTEM OF LIGHTS AND BELLS



   Because of the large number and the diversity of daily tasks that they
   have to perform it is not practicable for Members to be present in the
   House (or Senate) Chamber at every minute that the body is actually
   sitting. Furthermore, many of the routine matters do not require the
   personal attendance of all the Members. A legislative call system
   (consisting of electric lights and bells or buzzers located in various
   parts of the Capitol Building and of the House and Senate Office
   Buildings) alerts Members to certain occurrences in the House and
   Senate Chambers.

   In the House, the Speaker has ordered that the bells and lights
   comprising the system be utilized as follows:

   1 ring and 1 light on the left--Teller vote.

   1 long ring followed by a pause and then 3 rings and 3 lights on the
   left--Start or continuation of a notice or short quorum call in the
   Committee of the Whole that will be vacated if and when 100 Members
   appear on the floor. Bells are repeated every 5 minutes unless the
   call is vacated or the call is converted into a regular quorum call.

   1 long ring and extinguishing of 3 lights on the left--Short or notice
   quorum call vacated.

   2 rings and 2 lights on the left--Recorded vote, yea-and-nay vote or
   automatic rollcall vote by electronic device or by tellers with ballot
   cards. The bells are repeated 5 minutes after the first ring.

   2 rings and 2 lights on the left followed by a pause and then 2 more
   rings--Automatic rollcall vote or yea-and-nay vote taken by a call of
   the roll in the House. The bells are repeated when the clerk reaches
   the R's in the first call of the roll.

   2 rings followed by a pause and then 5 rings--First vote under
   Suspension of the Rules or on clustered votes. 2 bells are repeated 5
   minutes after the first ring. The first vote will take 15 minutes with
   successive votes at intervals of not less than 5 minutes. Each
   successive vote is signaled by 5 rings.

   3 rings and 3 lights on the left--Regular quorum call in either the
   House or in the Committee of the Whole by electronic device or by
   clerks. The bells are repeated 5 minutes after the first ring.

   3 rings followed by a pause and then 3 more rings--Regular quorum call
   by a call of the roll. The bells are repeated when the Clerk reaches
   the R's in the first call of the roll.

   3 rings followed by a pause and then 5 more rings--Quorum call in the
   Committee of the Whole that may be followed immediately by a
   five-minute recorded vote.

   4 rings and 4 lights on the left--Adjournment of the House.

   5 rings and 5 lights on the left--Any five-minute vote.

   6 rings and 6 lights on the left--Recess of the House.

   12 rings at 2-second intervals with 6 lights on the left-- Civil
   Defense Warning.

   The 7th light indicates that the House is in session.

  BROADCASTING LIVE COVERAGE OF FLOOR PROCEEDINGS



   The rules of the House provide for unedited radio and television
   broadcasting and recording of proceedings on the floor of the House.
   However, the rules prohibit the use of these broadcasts and recordings
   for any political purpose or in any commercial advertisement.
   Likewise, the rules of the Senate provide for broadcasting and
   recording of proceedings in the Senate Chamber with similar
   restrictions.

XII. CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET PROCESS



   The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of l974 provides
   Congress with a procedure for establishing appropriate budget and
   revenue levels for each year. Essentially, the Congressional budget
   process involves "concurrent resolutions on the budget" that are
   passed each year. These resolutions are designed to coordinate the
   revenue and spending decisions that the various legislative committees
   of Congress make in acting on measures within their respective
   jusrisdictions in order to provide fiscal discipline for Congress.

   Congress must complete action on a concurrent resolution on the budget
   for the next fiscal year by April 15. This resolution sets levels of
   new budget authority and spending, revenue, and debt levels. However,
   Congress may adopt a later budget resolution that revises or reaffirms
   the most recently adopted budget resolution.

   One of the mechanisms Congress uses to enforce projected budget
   authority and spending, revenue, and debt levels is called the
   reconciliation process. Under reconciliation, Congress in a budget
   resolution directs one or more of the legislative committees to
   determine and recommend changes in laws or bills that will achieve the
   levels set by the budget resolution. The directions to the committees
   specify the total amounts that must be changed but leaves to the
   discretion of the committees the changes that must be made to achieve
   the required levels.

   If only one committee has been directed to recommend changes, that
   committee reports its reconciliation legislation directly to the floor
   for consideration by the whole House. How ever, if more than one
   committee has been directed to make changes, the committees report the
   recommended changes to the Committee on the Budget. The Committee then
   reports an omnibus reconciliation bill to the floor for consideration
   by the whole House. The Committee may not change the reconciliation
   legislation substantively.

   When changes are to be made in legislation that already has been
   enacted or enrolled (for an explanation of enrollment, [128]see Part
   XVII), the vehicle used is a reconciliation bill that is enacted in
   the same manner as any other bill. However, if changes are to be made
   in bills or resolutions that have not been enrolled yet, Congress
   enacts the changes in a concurrent resolution not requiring approval
   of the President. The concurrent resolution directs the Clerk of the
   House or the Secretary of the Senate to make the necessary changes in
   the bill or resolution as directed by the reconciliation resolution.
   Congress must complete action on a reconciliation bill or resolution
   by June 15 of each year.

   Generally, after Congress has completed action on a concurrent
   resolution on the budget for a fiscal year, it is not in order to
   consider legislation that does not conform to the budget authority and
   spending, revenue, and debt levels set for that fiscal year.

   In 1985, Congress enacted legislation establishing a procedure to
   gradually reduce the Federal deficit to zero. The current target date
   for a zero deficit is 1993. Under the new procedure, if the estimated
   deficit for a fiscal year exceeds the statutory level for that year,
   across-the-board cuts in the Federal budget (with certain exceptions)
   would go into effect automatically pursuant to order of the President.

XIII. ENGROSSMENT AND MESSAGE TO SENATE



   The preparation of a copy of the bill in the form in which it has
   passed the House is sometimes a detailed and complicated process
   because of the large number and complexity of amendments to some bills
   adopted by the House. Frequently these amendments are offered during a
   spirited debate with little or no prior formal preparation. The
   amendment may be for the purpose of inserting new language,
   substituting different words for those set out in the bill, or
   deleting portions of the bill. It is not unusual to have more than 100
   amendments, including those proposed by the committee at the time the
   bill is reported and those offered from the floor during the
   consideration of the bill in the Chamber. Some of the amendments
   offered from the floor are written in longhand and others are
   typewritten. Each amendment must be inserted in precisely the proper
   place in the bill, with the spelling and punctuation exactly the same
   as it was adopted by the House. Obviously, it is extremely important
   that the Senate receive a copy of the bill in the precise form in
   which it has passed the House. The preparation of such a copy is the
   function of the enrolling clerk.

   There is an enrolling clerk in each House. In the House, the enrolling
   clerk is under the Clerk of the House. In the Senate, the enrolling
   clerk is under the Secretary of the Senate. The enrolling clerk
   receives all the papers relating to the bill, including the official
   Clerk's copy of the bill as reported by the standing committee and
   each amendment adopted by the House. From this material the enrolling
   clerk prepares the engrossed copy of the bill as passed, containing
   all the amendments agreed to by the House. At this point, the measure
   ceases technically to be called a bill and is termed "an act"
   signifying that it is the act of one body of the Congress, although it
   is still popularly referred to as a bill. The engrossed bill is
   printed on blue paper and a certificate that it passed the House of
   Representatives is signed by the Clerk of the House. The engrossed
   bill is delivered by a reading clerk to the Senate, while that body is
   actually sitting, in a rather formal ceremonious manner befitting the
   dignity of both Houses. The reading clerk is escorted into the Chamber
   by the Secretary or another officer of the Senate and on being
   recognized by the Presiding Officer of the Senate states that the
   House has passed the bill, giving its number and title, and requests
   the concurrence of the Senate.

   [130][Return to the Table of Contents]

XIV. SENATE ACTION



   The Presiding Officer of the Senate refers the engrossed bill to the
   appropriate standing committee of the Senate in conformity with the
   rules of the Senate. The bill is reprinted immediately and copies are
   made available in the document rooms of both Houses. This printing is
   known as the "Act print" or the "Senate referred print".

   [131][Return to the Table of Contents]

  COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION



   Senate committees give the bill the same kind of detailed
   consideration as it received in the House, and may report it with or
   without amendment or "table" it. A committee Member who wishes to
   express an individual view, or a group of Members who wish to file a
   minority report, may do so, by giving notice, at the time of the
   approval of the measure, of an intention to file supplemental,
   minority or additional views, in which event those views may be filed
   within 3 days with the clerk of the committee and they become a part
   of the report.

   When a committee reports a bill, it is reprinted with the committee
   amendments indicated by showing new matter in italics and deleted
   matter in line-through type. The calendar number and report number are
   indicated on the first and back pages, together with the name of the
   Senator making the report. The committee report and any minority or
   individual views accompanying the bill also are printed at the same
   time. Any Senator may enter a motion to discharge a committee from
   further consideration of a bill that it has failed to report after
   what is deemed to be a reasonable time. If the motion is agreed to by
   a majority vote, the committee is discharged and the bill is placed on
   the Calendar of Business under the rules of the Senate.

   All committee meetings, including those to conduct hearings, must be
   open to the public. However, a majority of the Members of a committee
   or subcommittee may, after discussion in closed session, vote in open
   session to close a meeting or series of meetings on the same subject
   for no longer than 14 days if it is determined that the matters to be
   discussed or testimony to be taken will disclose matters necessary to
   be kept secret in the interests of national defense or the
   confidential conduct of the foreign relations of the United States;
   will relate solely to internal committee staff management or
   procedure; will tend to charge an individual with a crime or
   misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing of an
   individual, or otherwise to expose an individual to public contempt,
   or will represent a clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an
   individual; will disclose law enforcement information that is required
   to be kept secret; will disclose certain information regarding certain
   trade secrets; or may disclose matters required to be kept
   confidential under other provisions of law or Government regulation.

   [132][Return to the Table of Contents]

  CHAMBER PROCEDURE



   The rules of procedure in the Senate differ to a large extent from
   those in the House. The Senate relies heavily on the practice of
   obtaining unanimous consent for actions to be taken. For example, at
   the time that a bill is reported, the Senator who is making the report
   may ask unanimous consent for the immediate consideration of the bill.
   If the bill is of a noncontroversial nature and there is no objection,
   the Senate may pass the bill with little or no debate and with only a
   brief explanation of its purpose and effect. Even in this instance the
   bill is subject to amendment by any Senator. A simple majority vote is
   necessary to carry an amendment as well as to pass the bill. If there
   is any objection, the report must lie over one day and the bill is
   placed on the calendar.

   Measures reported by standing committees of the Senate may not be
   considered unless the report of that committee has been available to
   Senate Members for at least 2 days (excluding Sundays and legal
   holidays) prior to consideration of the measure in the Senate. This
   requirement, however, may be waived by agreement of the majority and
   minority leaders and does not apply in certain emergency situations.

   In the Senate, measures are brought up for consideration by a simple
   unanimous consent request, by a complex unanimous consent agreement,
   by a motion to proceed to the consideration of a measure, or by a
   motion to consider a measure on the calendar. A unanimous consent
   agreement, sometimes referred to as a "time agreement," makes the
   consideration of a measure in order and often limits the amount of
   debate that will take place on the measure and lists the amendments
   that will be considered. The offering of a unanimous consent request
   to consider a measure or the offering of a motion to proceed to the
   consideration of a measure is reserved, by tradition, to the majority
   leader.

   Usually a motion to consider a measure on the calendar is made only
   when unanimous consent to consider the measure cannot be obtained.
   There is only one Calendar of Business in the Senate, there being no
   differentiation, as there is in the House, between (1) bills raising
   revenue, general appropriation bills, and bills of a public character
   appropriating money or property, and (2) other bills of a public
   character not appropriating money or property.

   The rules of the Senate provide that at the conclusion of the morning
   business for each "legislative day" the Senate proceeds to the
   consideration of the calendar. In the Senate, the term "legislative
   day" means the period of time from when the Senate adjourns until the
   next time the Senate adjourns. Because the Senate often "recesses"
   rather than "adjourns" at the end of a daily session, the "legislative
   day" usually does not correspond to the 24-hour period comprising a
   calendar day. Thus, a "legislative day" may cover a long period of
   time--from days to weeks, or even months. Because of this and the
   modern practice of waiving the call of the calendar by unanimous
   consent at the start of a new "legislative day," it is rare to have a
   call of the calendar. When the calendar is called, bills that are not
   objected to are taken up in their order, and each Senator is entitled
   to speak once and for 5 minutes only on any question. Objection may be
   interposed at any stage of the proceedings, but on motion the Senate
   may continue consideration after the call of the calendar is
   completed, and the limitations on debate then do not apply.

   On any day (other than a Monday that begins a new "legislative day"),
   following the announcement of the close of morning business, any
   Senator obtaining recognition may move to take up any bill out of its
   regular order on the calendar. Usually, this is the majority leader.
   The five-minute limitation on debate does not apply to the
   consideration of a bill taken up in this manner, and debate may
   continue until the hour when the Presiding Officer of the Senate "lays
   down" the unfinished business of the day. At that point consideration
   of the bill is discontinued and the measure reverts back to the
   Calendar of Business and may again be called up at another time under
   the same conditions.

   When a bill has been objected to and passed over on the call of the
   calendar it is not necessarily lost. The majority leader, after
   consulting the majority policy committee of the Senate and the
   minority leadership, determines the time at which the bill will be
   called up for debate. At that time, a motion is made to consider the
   bill. The motion is debatable if made after the morning hour.

   Once a Senator is recognized by the Presiding Officer, the Senator may
   speak for as long as the Senator wishes and loses the floor only when
   the Senator yields it or takes certain parliamentary actions that
   forfeit the Senator's right to the floor. How ever, a Senator may not
   speak more than twice on any one question in debate on the same
   legislative day without leave of the Senate. Debate ends when a
   Senator yields the floor and no other Senator seeks recognition, or
   when a unanimous consent agreement limiting the time of debate is
   operating.

   On occasion, Senators opposed to a measure may extend debate by making
   lengthy speeches intended to prevent or defeat action on the measure.
   This is the tactic known as "filibustering." Debate, however, may be
   closed if 16 Senators sign a motion to that effect and the motion is
   carried by three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn. Such a
   motion is voted on without debate on the second day after the day it
   is filed. This procedure is called "invoking cloture." In 1986, the
   Senate amended its rules to limit "post-cloture" debate to 30 hours. A
   Senator may speak for not more than one hour and may yield all or a
   part of that time to the majority or minority floor managers of the
   bill under consideration or to the majority or minority leader. The
   Senate may increase the time for "post-cloture" debate by a vote of
   three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn. After the time for
   debate has expired, the Senate may consider certain amendments before
   voting on the bill.

   While a measure is being considered it is subject to amendment and
   each amendment, including those proposed by the committee that
   reported the bill, is considered separately. Generally, there is no
   requirement that proposed amendments be germane to the subject matter
   of the bill except in the case of general appropriation bills. Under
   the rules, a "rider" (an amendment proposing substantive legislation
   to an appropriation bill) is prohibited, but this prohibition may be
   suspended by two-thirds vote on a motion to permit consideration of
   such an amendment on one day's notice in writing. Debate on the
   measure must be germane during the first 3 hours after the morning
   hour unless determined to the contrary by unanimous consent or on
   motion without debate. After final action on the amendments the bill
   is ready for engrossment and the third reading, which is usually by
   title only, although if demanded, it must be read in full. The
   Presiding Officer then puts the question on the passage and a voice
   vote (viva voce) is usually taken although a yea-and-nay vote is in
   order if demanded by one-fifth of the Senators present. A simple
   majority is necessary for passage. Before an amended measure is
   cleared for its return to the House of Representatives (or an
   unamended measure is cleared for enrollment), a Senator who voted with
   the prevailing side, or who abstained from voting, may make a motion
   within the next 2 days to reconsider the action. If the measure was
   passed without a recorded vote, any Senator may make the motion to
   reconsider. That motion is usually tabled and its tabling constitutes
   a final determination. If, however, the motion is granted, the Senate,
   by majority vote, may either affirm its action, which then becomes
   final, or reverse it.

   The original engrossed House bill, together with the engrossed Senate
   amendments, if any, is then returned to the House with a message
   stating the action taken by the Senate. Where amendments have been
   made by the Senate the message requests that the House concur in them.


   For a more detailed discussion of Senate procedure, see Senate
   Document No. 97-20 of the 97th Congress, second session, Enactment of
   a Law, by Robert B. Dove, then Parliamentarian of the Senate.

   [133][Return to the Table of Contents]

XV. FINAL ACTION ON AMENDED BILL



   On their return to the House the official papers relating to the
   amended measure are placed on the Speaker's table to await House
   action on the Senate amendments. If the amendments are of a minor or
   noncontroversial nature the Chairman of the committee that originally
   reported the bill-- or any Member--may, at the direction of the
   committee, ask unanimous consent to take the bill with the amendments
   from the Speaker's table and agree to the Senate amendments. At this
   point the Clerk reads the title of the bill and the Senate amendments.
   If there is no objection, the amendments are then declared to be
   agreed to, and the bill is ready to be enrolled for presentation to
   the President. Lacking unanimous consent, bills that do not require
   consideration in the Committee of the Whole are privileged and may be
   called up from the Speaker's table by motion for immediate
   consideration of the amendments. A simple majority is necessary to
   carry the motion and thereby complete floor action on the measure. A
   Senate amendment to a House bill is subject to a point of order that
   it must first be considered in the Committee of the Whole, if,
   originating in the House, it would be subject to that point.

   [134][Return to the Table of Contents]

  REQUEST FOR A CONFERENCE



   If, however, the amendments are substantial or controversial the
   Member may request unanimous consent to take the bill with the Senate
   amendments from the Speaker's table, disagree to the amendments and
   request a conference with the Senate to resolve the disagreeing votes
   of the 2 Houses. If there is objection it becomes necessary to obtain
   a special resolution from the Committee on Rules. However, the Speaker
   may recognize a Member for a motion, authorized by the committee
   having jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, to disagree
   to the amendments and ask for a conference. If there is no objection
   to the request, or if the motion is carried, the Speaker then appoints
   the managers (as the conferees are called) on the part of the House
   and a message is sent to the Senate advising it of the House action. A
   majority of the Members appointed to be managers must have been
   supporters of the House position, as determined by the Speaker. The
   Speaker must name Members primarily responsible for the legislation
   and must include, to the fullest extent feasible, the principal
   proponents of the major provisions of the bill as it passed the House.
   The Speaker usually follows the suggestions of the Chairman of the
   committee in charge of the bill in designating the managers on the
   part of the House from among the Members of the committee. The number
   is fixed by the Speaker and majority party representation generally
   reflects the ratio for the full House committee, but may be greater on
   important bills. Representation of both major parties is an important
   attribute of all our parliamentary procedures but, in the case of
   conference committees, it is important that the views of the House on
   the House measure be fully represented.

   If the Senate agrees to the request for a conference, a similar
   committee is appointed by unanimous consent by the Presiding Officer
   of the Senate. Both political parties may be represented on the Senate
   conference committee also. The Senate and House committees need not be
   the same size.

   The conference committee is sometimes popularly referred to as the
   "Third House of Congress."

   The request for a conference can be made only by the body in
   possession of the official papers. Occasionally the Senate,
   anticipating that the House will not concur in its amendments, votes
   to insist on its amendments and requests a conference on passage of
   the bill prior to returning the bill to the House. This practice
   serves to expedite the matter because several days' time may be saved
   by the designation of the Senate conferees before returning the bill
   to the House. The matter of which body requests the conference is not
   without significance because the one asking for the conference acts
   last on the report to be submitted by the conferees.

   [135][Return to the Table of Contents]

  AUTHORITY OF CONFEREES



   Although the managers on the part of each House meet together as one
   committee they are in effect 2 separate committees, each of which
   votes separately and acts by a majority vote. For this reason the
   number of managers from each House is largely immaterial.

   The conferees are strictly limited in their consideration to matters
   in disagreement between the 2 Houses. Consequently, they may not
   strike out or amend any portion of the bill that was not amended by
   the Senate. Furthermore, they may not insert new matter that is not
   germane to the differences between the 2 Houses. Where the Senate
   amendment revises a figure or an amount contained in the bill, the
   conferees are limited to the difference between the 2 numbers and may
   not increase the greater nor decrease the smaller figure. Neither
   House may alone, by instructions, empower its managers to make a
   change in the text to which both Houses have agreed, but the managers
   for both bodies may be given that authority by a concurrent resolution
   adopted by a majority of each House.

   When a disagreement to an amendment in the nature of a substitute is
   committed to a conference committee it is in order for the managers on
   the part of the House to propose a substitute which is a germane
   modification of the matter in disagreement, but the introduction of
   language in that substitute presenting a specific additional topic,
   question, issue, or proposition not committed to the conference
   committee by either House does not constitute a germane modification
   of the matter in disagreement. Moreover, their report may not include
   matter not committed to the conference committee by either House, nor
   may their report include a modification of any specific topic,
   question, issue, or proposition committed to the conference committee
   by either or both Houses if that modification is beyond the scope of
   that specific topic, question, issue, or proposition as committed to
   the conference committee.

   An amendment by the Senate to a general appropriation bill which would
   be in violation of the rules of the House, if the amendment had
   originated in the House, or an amendment by the Senate providing for
   an appropriation on a bill other than a general appropriation bill,
   may not be agreed to by the managers on the part of the House, unless
   a specific authority to agree to such an amendment is given first by
   the House by a separate vote on each specific amendment.

   [136][Return to the Table of Contents]

  MEETINGS AND ACTION OF CONFEREES



   The rules of the House require that conference meetings be open,
   unless the House, in open session, determines by a rollcall vote of a
   majority of those Members voting that all or part of the meeting will
   be closed to the public. When the report of the conference committee
   is read in the House, a point of order may be made that the conferees
   failed to comply with the House rule referred to in the preceding
   sentence. If the point of order is sustained, the conference report is
   considered rejected by the House and a new conference is requested.

   There are generally 4 forms of recommendations available to the
   conferees when reporting back to their bodies:

   (1) The Senate recede from all (or certain of) its amendments.

   (2) The House recede from its disagreement to all (or certain of) the
   Senate amendments and agree thereto.

   (3) The House recede from its disagreement to all (or certain of) the
   Senate amendments and agree thereto with amendments.

   (4) The House recede from all (or certain of) its amendments to the
   Senate amendments.

   In many instances the result of the conference is a compromise growing
   out of the third type of recommendation available to the conferees.
   The complete report may, of course, be comprised of any one or more of
   these recommendations with respect to the various amendments.
   Occasionally, the conferees find themselves unable to reach an
   agreement with respect to one or more amendments and report back a
   statement of their inability to agree on those particular amendments.
   These may then be acted upon separately. This partial disagreement is,
   of course, not practicable where the Senate strikes out all after the
   enacting clause and substitutes its own bill which must be considered
   as a single amendment.

   If they are unable to reach any agreement whatsoever, the conferees
   report that fact to their respective bodies and the amendments are in
   the position they were before the conference was requested. New
   conferees may be appointed in either or both Houses. In addition, the
   Houses may instruct the conferees as to the position they are to take.


   After House conferees on any bill or resolution in conference between
   the 2 bodies have been appointed for 20 calendar days and have failed
   to make a report, the rules of the House provide for a motion of the
   highest privilege to instruct the House conferees or discharge them
   and appoint new conferees. Further, during the last 6 days of a
   session it is a privileged motion to move to discharge, appoint, or
   instruct House conferees after House conferees have been appointed 36
   hours without having made a report.

   [137][Return to the Table of Contents]

  CONFERENCE REPORTS



   When the conferees, by majority vote of each group, have reached
   complete agreement (or find that they are able to agree with respect
   to some but not all amendments) they make their recommendations in a
   report made in duplicate that must be signed by a majority of the
   conferees appointed by each body. The minority portion of the managers
   have no authority to file a statement of minority views in connection
   with the report. The report is required to be printed in both Houses
   and must be accompanied by an explanatory statement prepared jointly
   by the conferees on the part of the House and the conferees on the
   part of the Senate. The statement must be sufficiently detailed and
   explicit to inform Congress as to the effect that the amendments or
   propositions contained in the report will have on the measure to which
   those amendments or propositions relate. The engrossed bill and
   amendments and one copy of the report are delivered to the body that
   is to act first on the report; namely, the body that had agreed to the
   conference requested by the other.

   In the Senate, the presentation of the report always is in order
   except when the Journal is being read or a point of order or motion to
   adjourn is pending, or while the Senate is voting or ascertaining the
   presence of a quorum. When the report is received, the question of
   proceeding to the consideration of the report, if raised, is
   immediately voted on without debate. The report is not subject to
   amendment in either body and must be accepted or rejected as an
   entirety. If the time for debate on the adoption of the report is
   limited, the time allotted must be equally divided between the
   majority and minority party. If the Senate, acting first, does not
   agree to the report it may by majority vote order it recommitted to
   the conferees. When the Senate agrees to the report, its managers are
   thereby discharged and it then delivers the original papers to the
   House with a message advising that body of its action.

   A report that contains any recommendations which go beyond the
   differences between the 2 Houses is subject to a point of order in its
   entirety. Any change in the text as agreed to by both Houses renders
   the report subject to the point of order and the matter is before the
   House de novo.

   The presentation of the report in the House always is in order, except
   when the Journal is being read, while the roll is being called, or the
   House is dividing on any proposition. The report is considered in the
   House and may not be sent to the Committee of the Whole on the
   suggestion that it contains matters ordinarily requiring consideration
   in that Committee. The report may not be received by the House if the
   required statement does not accompany it.

   It is, however, not in order to consider either (1) a conference
   report or (2) an amendment (including an amendment in the nature of a
   substitute) proposed by the Senate to a measure reported in
   disagreement between the 2 Houses, by a conference report, that the
   conferees have been unable to agree, until the third calendar day
   (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after the report
   and accompanying statement have been filed in the House, and
   consideration then is in order only if the report and accompanying
   statement have been printed in the edition of the Congressional Record
   for the day on which the report and statement have been filed.
   However, these provisions do not apply during the last 6 days of the
   session. Nor is it in order to consider a conference report or such an
   amendment unless copies of the report and accompanying statement,
   together with the text of the amendment, have been available to
   Members for at least 2 hours before the beginning of consideration.
   However, it is always in order to call up for consideration a report
   from the Committee on Rules only making in order the consideration of
   a conference report or such an amendment notwithstanding the
   requirement that the report and text of the amendment be available for
   at least 2 hours before the beginning of consideration. The time
   allotted for debate on a conference report or such an amendment is
   divided equally between the majority party and the minority party.
   However, if the majority and minority floor managers both are
   supporters of the conference report, one-third of the debate time must
   be allotted to a Member who is opposed to the conference report. If
   the House does not agree to a conference report that the Senate has
   already agreed to, the report may not be recommitted to conference
   because the Senate conferees are discharged when the Senate agrees to
   the report.

   When a conference report is called up before the House containing
   matter which would be in violation of the rules of the House with
   respect to germaneness if the matter had been offered as an amendment
   in the House, and which is contained either (1) in a Senate amendment
   to that measure (including a Senate amendment in the nature of a
   substitute for the text of that measure as passed by the House) and
   accepted by the House conferees or agreed to by the conference
   committee with modification or (2) in a substitute agreed to by the
   conference committee, it is in order, at any time after the reading of
   the report is completed or dispensed with and before the reading of
   the statement, to make a point of order that nongermane matter, which
   must be specified in the point of order, is contained in the report.
   It is also in order to make a point of order to nongermane Senate
   matter in the conference report that originally appeared in the Senate
   bill but was not included in the House-passed version. If the point of
   order is sustained, it is then in order for the Chair to entertain a
   motion, that is of high privilege, that the House reject the
   nongermane matter covered by the point of order. It is in order to
   debate the motion for 40 minutes, one-half of the time to be given to
   debate in favor of, and one-half in opposition to, the motion.
   Notwithstanding the final disposition of a point of order made with
   respect to the report, or of a motion to reject nongermane matter,
   further points of order may be made with respect to the report, and
   further motions may be made to reject other nongermane matter in the
   conference report not covered by any previous point of order which has
   been sustained. If a motion to reject has been adopted, after final
   disposition of all points of order and motions to reject, the
   conference report is considered as rejected and the question then
   pending before the House is whether (1) to recede and concur with an
   amendment that consists of that portion of the conference report not
   rejected or (2) to insist on the House amendment with respect to
   nongermane Senate matter that originally appeared in the Senate bill
   but was not included in the House-passed version. If all motions to
   reject are defeated, then, after the allocation of time for debate on
   the conference report, it is in order to move the previous question on
   the adoption of the conference report.

   Similar procedures are available in the House when the Senate proposes
   an amendment to a measure that would be in violation of the rule
   against nongermane amendments, and thereafter it is (1) reported in
   disagreement by a committee of conference or (2) before the House and
   the stage of disagreement is reached.

   The amendments of the Senate in disagreement may be voted on
   separately and may be adopted by a majority vote after the adoption of
   the conference report itself as though no conference had been had with
   respect to those amendments. The Senate may recede from all
   amendments, or from certain of its amendments, insisting on the others
   with or without a request for a conference with respect to them. If
   the House does not accept the amendments insisted on by the Senate the
   entire conference process begins again with respect to them.

   [138][Return to the Table of Contents]

  CUSTODY OF PAPERS



   The custody of the original official papers is important in conference
   procedure because either body may act only when in possession of the
   papers. As indicated above the request for a conference may be made
   only by the body in possession. The papers are then transmitted to the
   body agreeing to the conference and by it to the managers of the House
   that asked for the conference. The latter in turn carry the papers
   with them to the conference and at its conclusion turn them over to
   the managers of the House that agreed to the conference. The latter
   deliver them to their own House, that acts first on the report and
   then delivers the papers to the other House for final action on the
   report.

   Each group of conferees, at the conclusion of the conference, retains
   one copy of the report that has been made in duplicate, and signed by
   a majority of the managers of each body--the House copy signed first
   by the House managers and the Senate copy signed first by its
   managers.

   Obviously a bill cannot become a law of the land until it has been
   approved in identical terms by both Houses of the Congress. When the
   bill has finally been approved by both Houses all the original papers
   are transmitted to the enrolling clerk of the body in which the bill
   originated.

   [139][Return to the Table of Contents]

XVI. BILL ORIGINATING IN SENATE



   >The preceding discussion has described the legislative process for
   bills originating in the House. When a bill originates in the Senate,
   this process is reversed. When the Senate passes a bill that
   originated in the Senate, it is sent to the House for consideration.
   The bill is referred to the appropriate House committee for
   consideration. If the committee reports the bill to the full House and
   if the bill is passed by the House without amendment, it is ready for
   enrollment. [140](See Part XVII.) If the House passes an amended
   version of the Senate bill, the bill is returned to the Senate for
   action on the House amendments. The Senate may agree to the amendments
   or request a conference to resolve the disagreement over the House
   amendments.

   [141][Return to the Table of Contents]

XVII. ENROLLMENT



   When the bill has been agreed to in identical form by both
   bodies--either without amendment by the Senate, or by House
   concurrence in the Senate amendments, or by agreement in both bodies
   to the conference report--a copy of the bill is enrolled for
   presentation to the President.

   The preparation of the enrolled bill is a painstaking and important
   task because it must reflect precisely the effect of all amendments,
   either by way of deletion, substitution, or addition, agreed to by
   both bodies. The enrolling clerk of the House (with respect to bills
   originating in the House) receives the original engrossed bill, the
   engrossed Senate amendments, the signed conference report, the several
   messages from the Senate, and a notation of the final action by the
   House, for the purpose of preparing the enrolled copy. From these the
   enrolling clerk must prepare meticulously the final form of the bill,
   as it was agreed to by both Houses, for presentation to the President.
   On occasion there have been upward of 500 amendments, particularly
   after a conference, each of which must be set out in the enrollment
   exactly as agreed to, and all punctuation must be in accord with the
   action taken.

   The enrolled bill is printed on parchment paper, with a certificate on
   the reverse side of the last page, to be signed by the Clerk of the
   House stating that the bill originated in the House of Representatives
   (or by the Secretary of the Senate when the bill has originated in
   that body). It is examined for accuracy by the Committee on House
   Administration (or by the Secretary of the Senate when the bill
   originated in that body). When the Committee is satisfied with the
   accuracy of the bill the Chairman of the Committee attaches a slip
   stating that it finds the bill truly enrolled and sends it to the
   Speaker of the House for signature. All bills, regardless of the body
   in which they originated, are signed first by the Speaker and then by
   the Vice President of the United States, who, under the Constitution,
   serves as the President of the Senate. The Speaker of the House may
   sign enrolled bills whether or not the House is in session. The
   President of the Senate may sign bills only while the Senate is
   actually sitting unless advance permission is granted to sign during a
   recess or after adjournment. If the Speaker or the President of the
   Senate is unable to sign the bill, it may be signed by the authorized
   presiding officer of the respective House. After both signatures are
   affixed the bill is returned to the Committee for the purpose of being
   presented to the President for action under the Constitution.

   [142][Return to the Table of Contents]

XVIII. PRESIDENTIAL ACTION



    Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution provides in part that--

     Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and
     the Senate, shall, before it becomes a Law, be presented to the
     President of the United States.



   In actual practice a clerk of the Committee on House Administration
   (or the Secretary of the Senate when the bill originated in that body)
   delivers the original enrolled bill to an employee at the White House
   and obtains a receipt, and the fact of the delivery is then reported
   to the House by the Chairman of the Committee. Delivery to a White
   House employee has customarily been regarded as presentation to the
   President and as commencing the 10-day Constitutional period for
   Presidential action.

   Copies of the enrolled bill usually are transmitted by the White House
   to the various departments interested in the subject matter so that
   they may advise the President who, of course, cannot be personally
   familiar with every item in every bill.

   If the President approves the bill, he signs it and usually writes the
   word "approved" and the date, although the Constitution requires only
   that the President sign it.

   The Supreme Court has stated that undoubtedly the President when
   approving bills may be said to participate in the enactment of laws,
   which the Constitution requires the President to execute.

   The bill may become law without the President's signature by virtue of
   the Constitutional provision that if the President does not return a
   bill with objections within 10 days (excluding Sundays) after it has
   been presented to the President, it shall be a law in like manner as
   if the President had signed it. However, if Congress by their
   adjournment prevent its return, it does not become law. The latter
   event is what is known as a "pocket veto," that is, the bill does not
   become law even though the President has not sent his objections to
   the Congress.

   Notice of the signing of a bill by the President is sent usually by
   message to the House in which it originated and that House informs the
   other, although this action is not necessary to the validity of the
   act. The action is also noted in the Congressional Record.

   A bill becomes law on the date of approval (or passage over the
   President's veto), unless it expressly provides a different effective
   date.

   [143][Return to the Table of Contents]

  VETO MESSAGE



   By the terms of the Constitution, if the President does not approve
   the bill "he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in
   which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at
   large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it." It is the usual
   but not invariable rule that a bill returned with the President's
   objections, must be voted on at once and when laid before the House
   the question on the passage is considered as pending. A vetoed bill is
   always privileged, and a motion to take it from the table is in order
   at any time.

   The Member in charge moves the previous question which is put by the
   Speaker, as follows: "The question is, Will the House on
   reconsideration agree to pass the bill, the objections of the
   President to the contrary notwithstanding?" The Clerk calls the roll
   and those in favor of passing the bill answer "Aye," and those opposed
   "No." If fewer than two-thirds of the Members present (constituting a
   quorum) vote in the affirmative the bill is killed, and a message is
   usually sent to the Senate advising that body of the decision that the
   bill shall not pass. If, however, two-thirds vote in the affirmative,
   the bill is sent with the President's objections to the Senate
   together with a message advising it of the action in the House.

   There is a similar procedure in the Senate where again a two-thirds
   affirmative vote is necessary to pass the bill over the President's
   objections. If then passed by the Senate the measure becomes the law
   of the land notwithstanding the objections of the President, and it is
   ready for publication as a binding statute.

   [144][Return to the Table of Contents]

XIX. PUBLICATION



   One of the important steps in the enactment of a valid law is the
   requirement that it shall be made known to the people who are to be
   bound by it. Obviously, there would be no justice if the state were to
   hold its people responsible for their conduct before it made known to
   them the unlawfulness of such behavior. That idea is implicit in the
   Constitutional prohibition against enacting ex post facto laws. In
   practice, our laws are published immediately upon their enactment so
   that they may be known to the people.

   If the President approves a bill, or allows it to become law without
   signing it, the original enrolled bill is sent from the White House to
   the Archivist of the United States for publication. If a bill is
   passed by both Houses over the objections of the President the body
   that last overrides the veto likewise transmits it. There it is
   assigned a public law number, and paginated for the Statutes at Large
   volume covering that session of Congress. The public and private law
   numbers run in sequence starting anew at the beginning of each
   Congress, and since 1957 are prefixed for ready identification by the
   number of the Congress--that is, the first public law of the 101st
   Congress is designated Public Law 101-1 and the first private law of
   the 101st Congress is designated Private Law 101-1. Subsequent laws of
   this Congress also will contain the same prefix designator.

   [145][Return to the Table of Contents]

  SLIP LAWS



   The first official publication of the statute is in the form generally
   known as the "slip law". In this form, each law is published
   separately as an unbound pamphlet. The heading indicates the public or
   private law number, the date of approval, and the bill number. The
   heading of a slip law for a public law also indicates the United
   States Statutes at Large citation. If the statute has been passed over
   the veto of the President, or has become law without the President's
   signature because he did not return it with objections, an appropriate
   statement is inserted in lieu of the usual notation of approval.

   The Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records
   Administration, which prepares the slip laws, provides marginal
   editorial notes giving the citations to laws mentioned in the text and
   other explanatory details. The marginal notes also give the United
   States Code classifications, thus enabling the reader immediately to
   determine where the statute will appear in the Code. Each slip law
   also includes an informative guide to the legislative history of the
   law consisting of the committee report number, the name of the
   committee in each House, as well as the date of consideration and
   passage in each House, with a reference to the Congressional Record by
   volume, year, and date. A reference to Presidential
   statements--relating to the approval of a bill (or the veto of a bill
   when the veto was overridden and the bill becomes law)--is included in
   the legislative history in the form of a citation to the Weekly
   Compilation of Presidential Documents.

   Copies of the slip laws are delivered to the document rooms of both
   Houses where they become available to officials and the public. They
   may also be obtained by annual subscription or individual purchase
   from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office.


   Section 113 of title 1 of the United States Code provides that slip
   laws are competent evidence in all the courts, tribunals and public
   offices of the United States, and of the several States.

   [146][Return to the Table of Contents]

  STATUTES AT LARGE



   For the purpose of providing a permanent collection of the laws of
   each session of Congress, the bound volumes (which are called the
   United States Statutes at Large) are prepared by the Office of the
   Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration. When
   the latest volume containing the laws of the first session of the
   101st Congress becomes available it will be No. 103 in the series.
   Each volume contains a complete index and a table of contents. From
   1956 through 1976, each volume contained a table of earlier laws
   affected. These tables were cumulated for 1956-1970 and supplemented
   for 1971-1975 in pamphlet form, and discontinued in 1976. From 1963
   through 1974, each volume also contained a most useful table showing
   the legislative history of each law in the volume. This latter table
   was not included in subsequent volumes because, beginning in 1975, the
   legislative histories have appeared at the end of each law. There are
   also extensive marginal notes referring to laws in earlier volumes and
   to earlier and later matters in the same volume.

   Under the provisions of a statute originally enacted in 1895, these
   volumes are legal evidence of the laws contained in them and will be
   accepted as proof of those laws in any court in the United States.

   The Statutes at Large are a chronological arrangement of the laws
   exactly as they have been enacted. There is no attempt to arrange the
   laws according to their subject matter or to show the present status
   of an earlier law that has been amended on one or more occasions. That
   is the function of a code of laws.

   [147][Return to the Table of Contents]

  UNITED STATES CODE



   The United States Code contains a consolidation and codification of
   the general and permanent laws of the United States arranged according
   to subject matter under 50 title headings, in alphabetical order to a
   large degree. It sets out the current status of the laws, as amended,
   without repeating all the language of the amendatory acts except where
   necessary for that purpose and is declared to be prima facie evidence
   of those laws. Its purpose is to present the laws in a concise and
   usable form without requiring recourse to the many volumes of the
   Statutes at Large containing the individual amendments.

   The Code is prepared by the Law Revision Counsel of the House of
   Representatives. New editions are published every 6 years and
   cumulative supplements are published after the conclusion of each
   regular session of the Congress.

   Twenty-two of the 50 titles have been revised and enacted into
   positive law, and 2 have been eliminated by consolidation with other
   titles. Titles that have been revised and enacted into positive law
