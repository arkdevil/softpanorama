========================

This program has no guarantees, no warranties, no nothing.  Use it
as is, and that's that.

Overview
========
I started to write this program more than half year ago when I was
using Nemo Commander. I was close to finish it, but I've got
new job, less free time and new program called os2com ( Os2 Commander )
which has it own arcviewer build in. So my small project was freezen for
an half of year. But life is changing. Now I have little free time, I
get back to Nemo ( somehow I feel more comfortable in it ) and find couple
of messages in SU.OS2 with people asking for arcview, so I decide to
finish my program. I hope nobody need explanations what arcview is and how
to use it, so I'm skiping this part of doc :)

Installation
============
Just copy files arcview2.exe, arcview2.cfg and compress.cfg ( if you don't have one 
already ) to any directory in path.
Load with any editor file arcview2.cfg and correct it for your needs.
First line must be name and path to your compress.cfg. Next one it temporary
directory and last is a file viewer which will be executed in case file you
viewing is not a archive. Oh, I forget to add that you have to add Delete 
keyword to your compress.cfg. Here is example:

===================== compress.cfg  ==================================
Archiver LH113
        Extension       LZH
        Ident           2,2d6c68                        ; "-lh"
DOS     Add             lha a /o /m %a %f
OS2     Add             lh a %a %f /c
DOS     Extract         lha e /m %a %f
OS2     Extract         lh x %a %f /o
DOS     View            lha l %a
OS2     Delete          lh d %a %f
OS2     View            lh v %a
End Archiver
===================== compress.cfg  ===================================

Adding Delete keyword does not affect on squish. 
If some feature is not avalaible in os/2 version of archiver you need
to write a comment started with "--- And here what you want to say ".
This will exclude this command from executing.

Notes
=====
If you hear some beeps while trying to do some things ( for example
delete file in arj archive ) this mean that this feature is not supported
by archiver. 
In case you want to rename arcview2.exe don't forget to rename arcview2.cfg
to same name. For example if you did av2.exe you mast have av2.cfg.
This is first version and I it probaly has many bugs. One of them I know 
already: in lzh archive last file are doubled in file list. I'll fix this
as soon as possible.

Donations
=========
This programm is free. Usualy I include here my address where anybody
can send me donations in size of $5, but I see no way to get money
directly to Belarus from outside world, so I can skip this part.
