What is DumbDrv?

DumbDrv is a device driver which creates a null block device  -
a  drive  that does absolutely nothing, except for occupying  a
drive  letter.  This can be useful if one wants  to  reserve  a
drive letter at boot time, so that another driver can use  that
drive  letter.  The KillDrv utility may be  used  to  delete  a
DumbDrv device.

Here's an example where DumbDrv is useful: Let's say we have  a
hard disk called C:, a CD-ROM drive (accessed with MSCDEX.EXE),
and  a  ramdisk created by RAMDRIVE.SYS. We now want the CD-ROM
drive to be D: and the ramdisk E:. Since RAMDRIVE.SYS is loaded
before  MSCDEX.EXE, the ramdisk will automatically  become  D:,
though.  This is where DumbDrv comes in. By loading DUMBDRV.SYS
just  before  RAMDRIVE.SYS, we reserve  the  drive  letter  D:,
forcing  the  ramdisk  to becomwe E:. We can  then  delete  the
DumbDrv  using  the  KillDrv utility, and  load  MSCDEX  as  D:
instead.

Installation

DumbDrv is installed by entering the line

        DEVICE=d:\path\DUMBDRV.SYS

in  your  CONFIG.SYS file. The driver will be loaded  the  next
time  you  boot your computer. DumbDrv will display  a  message
saying which drive letter it occupies.

NOTE:  Drive  letters  are  assigned to  block  device  drivers
sequentially in the order they are loaded in CONFIG.SYS.
