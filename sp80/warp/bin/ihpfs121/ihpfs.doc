                     An HPFS Driver for DOS

Overview

The  OS/2  operating system introduces a new file  system,  the
High  Performance File System (HPFS). HPFS has many  advantages
over  the  FAT  system that DOS uses. However,  it  is  usually
impossible to access files on an HPFS partition without booting
OS/2.

iHPFS makes it possible for OS/2 users to use their HPFS parti-
tions  when they boot plain DOS. The HPFS partition is assigned
a  drive  letter,  and can be accessed like  any  DOS  drive  -
although  the current version of iHPFS is restricted  to  read-
only access.

iHPFS is easy to install and convenient to use, as it acts like
any  DOS  drive. Data files and programs on the HPFS  partition
may be read and executed, or copied to other drives.



Disclaimer and Licence Agreement

iHPFS  is  supplied as is. The author disclaims all warranties,
expressed  or  implied,  including,  without  limitation,   the
warranties  of merchantability and of fitness for any  purpose.
The  author  assumes  no  liability  for  damages,  direct   or
consequential, which may result from the use of iHPFS.

You  may copy iHPFS on the following conditions: iHPFS must  be
copied  in  unmodified  form,  and  this  documentation,   also
unmodified, must be included in the copy.

You  may  give iHPFS to your friends or post it for downloading
on  bulletin  boards and ftp sites only as long  as  the  above
conditions are met.



System requirements

In order to run iHPFS, you need
    - a 386 processor or better
    - MS-DOS or PC DOS version 4 or later,
      or DR DOS version 5 or 6.
It  is  also nice if you have an HPFS partition, otherwise  all
you'll get from iHPFS is an error message.



How to use iHPFS

Run IHPFS.EXE from the DOS prompt. The syntax is:

         IHPFS [/C=x] [/L] [d:n d:n ...]
or       IHPFS /U [d:]

The brackets indicate an optional parameter.

d:      The  drive letter that you want to assign to  an  iHPFS
        drive.  You may specify more than one drive  letter  on
        the   same  command  line.  If  no  drive  letters  are
        specified,  iHPFS  will  scan  your  hard  drives   and
        automatically install all HPFS partitions.

n       The  number  of  the HPFS partition that  you  want  to
        access.  HPFS  partitions are numbered  (logically)  so
        that  you  can  specify to iHPFS which  partitions  you
        want  to access. The first HPFS partition on the  first
        hard  disk  is partition number 1. Note that only  HPFS
        partitions  are counted - if your system has  two  HPFS
        partitions, they will have numbers 1 and 2,  regardless
        of any other non-HPFS partitions you might have.

/C=x    This  option  tells  iHPFS to set up  a  cache  in  XMS
        memory.  A  cache can improve performance dramatically.
        x   specifies  the  cache  size,  in  KB,  and  is  not
        optional.  To  use this option, you must  have  an  XMS
        driver like HIMEM.SYS loaded.

/L      This  option  makes  it possible to access  files  with
        long  filenames.  These  files  will  be  given  a  new
        filename  and extension. The new name will  consist  of
        the  first  valid charactes (eight or less) before  the
        first  dot  in  the  long filename.  The  extension  is
        computed  from  the long filename, and is  made  up  of
        letters,  digits and a few other characters.  Filenames
        that  begin with a dot will be seen as HPFS.xxx,  where
        xxx is the computed extension.
        
/U      The  /U  option uninstalls iHPFS drives.  If  no  drive
        letter  is  specified, this will  uninstall  all  iHPFS
        drives,  and  remove  the driver from  memory.  (A  few
        hundred bytes will still remain in memory, though.)

        If  a  drive letter is specified, only that drive  will
        be removed.



Examples

To install iHPFS for all HPFS partitions, type
         IHPFS

To  install  iHPFS for all HPFS partitions with  long  filename
support and 128KB of cache, type
         IHPFS /C=128 /L

To install only HPFS partition 2 as G:, type
         IHPFS G:2

To remove iHPFS drive G:, type
         IHPFS /U G:

To uninstall iHPFS completely, type
         IHPFS /U



Large IDE drives

There is a problem with accessing IDE (ATA) drives larger  than
528MB   (528  million  bytes).  The  problem  arises  on   some
configurations  if  a  partition occupies any  cylinders  above
1024.  iHPFS  can access these partitions if the BIOS  supports
it, and will try to do so automatically. If it doesn't work for
your HPFS partitions, you may need a BIOS upgrade or a software
driver.  Please  let  me  know if you experience  any  problems
related to large IDE drives.
