        __________________________________________________________________

        PM UNDELETE is a GUI program for a quick recovery of deleted
        files.

        OS/2 offers a feature which allows the recovery of deleted files.
        However, the control program for this feature is a command line
        driven tool with poor comfort: The OS/2 program UNDELETE.

        PM UNDELETE is an easy-to-use PM program to undelete deleted files
        to their original directory or to the system's TMP directory.
        Deleted files may be also be sent to Nirwana, that is, their
        deletion is made permanent. (This corresponds to the /F option of
        the OS/2 UNDELETE command.)

        PM UNDELETE is also able to display deleted files in order
        to explore their contents before performing any actions.

        PM UNDELETE uses the OS/2 program UNDELETE.COM to do its job.
        This means that PM UNDELETE does not rely on a specific version
        of OS/2 nor does it use undocumented system calls or other
        quirks!!! This feature is sometimes called 'compatibility'.

        This program is FREEWARE and may be distributed together with
        this documentation to all OS/2 users!!!

        __________________________________________________________________
        ___ Installation _________________________________________________

        Copy PMUNDEL.EXE and PMUNDEL.ICO (or any other icon you prefer) to
        a directory in your PATH.

        You should install a program object for PMUNDEL.EXE on the desktop
        for a quick access!

        Be shure that the variable TMP is set in the OS environment
        and that it points to a directory for temporary files.

        (e.g.         SET TMP=C:\TMP   )

        Be shure that the variable DELDIR is set in the OS environment
        for all drives on which the recovery of deleted files is desired.
        Refer to your OS/2 user manual (online) for more information.

        (e.g.         SET DELDIR=C:\TMP\DELETE;D:\DELETE   )

        __________________________________________________________________
        ___ Usage ________________________________________________________

        Start PMUNDEL.EXE. If you start the program from the OS/2 command
        line be shure to add the command line parameter "/REFRESH".
        (See also 'bug list' below!)

        PM UNDELETE displays all drives which support the recovery of
        deleted files (that is, all files specified in the DELDIR variable).

        Select a drive and press the refresh button or double click the
        drive. Refresh may be clicked whenever another process has erased
        files and the list of files being deleted (for the selected drive)
        should be updated.

        PM UNDELETE displays all files which can be recovered.

        Select the desired files (extended multiple selection).

        By pressing the appropriate button you can undelete the selected
        file(s) to their original directory or to the TMP directory.
        'Deleting files forever' means that the files may not be
        recovered any longer.

        'Deleting files forever' means that the files may not be
        recovered any longer. (Corresponds to the /F /A options of the
        OS/2 UNDELETE command.)

        'Viewing files' means that all selected files can be displayed by
        an internal viewer. The viewer displays all selected files one by
        one and supports vertical and horizontal scrolling and binary file
        handling. If a file contains more than 500 lines, the viewer asks
        whether the whole file should be displayed or whether it may be
        truncated for viewing.

        It is sooo easy.

        __________________________________________________________________
        ___ Command line options _________________________________________

        /REFRESH   Refer to section "Bugs" below

        /NOBANNER  The moving banner may be disabled by the menu option
                   "Disabled banner". This may be useful in the case that
                   this feature consumes too much CPU time on your system.

                   Starting the program with the command line option

                        "/NOBANNER"

                   disables the moving banner from the beginning.

        /DRIVE X:  You may supply a drive letter for the initial list of
                   deleted files.
                   (Of course it is possible to access all other drives
                   through the menu of drives.)

        __________________________________________________________________
        ___ Special Hint _________________________________________________

        Michael Bode (bode@zarkon.in-ulm.de) pointed out the following
        nice idea to me. Thanks a lot.

              "Man legt PM Undelete zusaetzlich ins Open Menue des
              DELETE Directories und setzt das Default Open auf Undelete.
              Jetzt noch das entsprechende Icon fuers DELETE-Dir und
              fertig ist die Macintosh-like Trashcan.
              Jedenfalls bis auf Kleinigkeiten."

        For all those who are not familiar with the German language.
        (If you need other translations (Suaheli, Old-Icelandic, etc.)
        let me know...)

         o Open the settings of the DELETE directory of a desired
           drive X:
         o Go to the menu tab.
         o Select "Open" in "Available Menus"
         o "Create another" entry for the "Open"
         o Enter "Undelete" as program title and "PMUNDEL.EXE"
           (probably with path spec.) as program name.
           Do not forget the command line argument "/DRIVE X:"
         o Change "Settings" for the "Open"
         o Set default action to "PM Undelete"
         o Close settings notebook

        With this setup you can have a nice (almost) Mac-like trashcan.
        Whenever you open the folder with the DELETE directory of a
        specific drive the PM Undelete program is started listing all
        files that can be undeleted.

        __________________________________________________________________
        ___ Bugs _________________________________________________________

        PM UNDELETE has a bug causing an incorrect display of the dialog
        window if being started from the OS/2 command line. This is due
        to a bug either in the DrREXX window handler or in the
        corresponding OS/2 subsystem.

        A workaround for this bug (since it is now documented, hence I will
        call it a feature...) is to start the program with the command line
        option "/REFRESH".

           (e.g.      pmundel /REFRESH      )

        This will redraw the dialog window after a call to OS/2 UNDELETE.

        If PM UNDELETE is started directly from the WPS via a program
        object, via a program file object or via a PM shell (such as
        PC/2) the dialog window will be displayed properly!

        NOTE: The conversion of all filenames to UPPERCASE is *not* my
              fault. The guy who wrote OS/2 UNDELETE must be blamed
              for this!!! (The filenames are stored in the proper case
              in CONTROL.DEL.)
