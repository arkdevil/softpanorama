  -----------------------  DataMake program --------------------------

  --    This program is a simple code generator. It's intended to produce
  --    a Unit that will create all the databases used by your application.
  --    This way, a program can be shipped without the datafiles, which can
  --    be created as needed.
  --    The program is fairly easy to use, as it is based in the DataList
  --    example program that ships with Delphi.
  --    The code generated : CreateDB.Pas is ready to be included in your project
  --      whenever you decide you can call CreateDBMS to recreate the datafiles.
  --      The code style is structured and readable (as much as this is) and can
  --      be easily modified to further specialize.
  --
  --    This program is FreeWare: use it or modify it at your own will.
  --     I'll be glad if it helped someone.

  --  Revision history:
  --  14/Jun/95 : created.
  --
  --  Known limitations:
  --   This version doesn't handle dBase Expressions indexes.  To do so I'd
  --   have to dig rather deep in the Borland's DBE api.  As I don't have
  --   the manuals, and I don't need to use dBase expressions right now, I
  --   left it aside.  Maybe someone wants to improve the program to do it.
