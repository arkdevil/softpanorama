0.0 Introduction

IconBtn is a freeware demonstration program from
C.I.U.P.K.C. Software. It provides source code that
illustrates how to add an icon to a text button,
similar to the BitBtn component.
--------------------------------------------------------
1.0 Installation of IconBtn on your Hard Disk

The following steps assume you have acquired 
ICONBTN.ZIP from the CIUPKC Software HQ WWW site at
www.webcom.com. If you didn't, then change the
references to "where you downloaded it" to where
it was otherwise acquired (floppy disk, etc.)

1.01 Create a new directory CIUPKC on your hard drive.
     (You can skip this step if you have other CIUPKC
     components already installed.)
1.02 Copy the ICONBTN.ZIP from where you downloaded it
     to the new directory.
1.03 Unzip the file using PKZIP 2.04G or a compatible
     utility.
1.04 You should then see the following files (aside from
     the .ZIP file):
     ICONBTN.DCU		ICONBTN Demo Program
     ICONBTN.DFM		ICONBTN Demo Program
     ICONBTN.DPR		ICONBTN Demo Program
     ICONBTN.DSK		ICONBTN Demo Program
     ICONBTN.OPT		ICONBTN Demo Program
     ICONBTN.PAS		ICONBTN Demo Program 
     ICONBTN.RES		ICONBTN Demo Program 
     ICONBUTN.DCU		Compiled Program Unit
     ICONBUTN.DFM		Unit Form File
     ICONBUTN.PAS		Unit Source Code
     ICONBUTN.RES		Unit Resource File
     README.TXT			This file

1.05 You are now ready to run the demo program from Delphi.
--------------------------------------------------------
1.1 Running the ICONBTN Demo Program

1.11 Start Delphi, then choose Open Project. Move to the
     CIUPKC directory and select ICONBTN.DPR.
1.12 You will get an error message saying "Error loading
     Symbol File" and nothing seems to happen. This is
     because no .DSM file was included to save space.
1.13 Select Compile/Build All and Delphi will recreate the
     program, including the symbol file.
1.14 Choose View|Units and open the ICONBUTN.PAS file. This
     allows a look at the simple source code for the demo.
     Choose View|Forms and bring up Form1. This shows the
     Text button but no Icon, since it is displayed at run time.
1.15 Choose Run|Run and you can view the final product.
     Select Close from the system menu to end the program.
