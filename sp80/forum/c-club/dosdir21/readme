                DOSDIR: A Portable DOS/UNIX/VMS Directory Interface
				version 2.1
                -----------------------------------------------

DOSDIR is an implementation of the MS-DOS directory functions (findfirst,
findnext, and fnsplit) on MS-DOS, UNIX, and VMS platforms using the
appropriate file & directory structure.

It uses the DOS directory framework to provide a portable interface
for MS-DOS/UNIX/VMS application programmers.  DOSDIR minimizes the OS-
specific directory access code for applications allowing programmers to
concentrate on the application itself and not on the low-level directory
and file structure.  DOSDIR applications will run on their native operating
systems with the appropriate file syntax and handling, which is expected
for that platform.

An alternative mechanism, the POSIX opendir/readdir directory functions,
provides low-level directory access with all of the file handling in
the application.  Findfirst/findnext filter files matching a filemask
and returns file information, such as whether the entry is directory or a
regular file or the entry is read-only.  However, readdir() returns only the
filenames of files in the opened directory stream.

The package includes the following files:

	dosdir.c      - DOSDIR findfirst/findnext functions
        dirent.c      - C/C++ Run Time Library opendir/readdir functions
	fnsplit.c     - C/C++ Run Time Library fnsplit function
	match.c       - Info-ZIP regular expression evaluator
        *.h           - DOSDIR header files
	filelist.c    - Example program using dosdir directory functions
	example2.c    - Another example program
        example3.c    - An example program for opendir functions
	makefile.bor  - Makefile for MS-DOS with Borland C++
	makefile.unx  - Makefile for UNIX with gcc
	vaxmake.com   - Script to compile examples for VAX/VMS

DOSDIR supports and has been tested under the following systems:
MS-DOS 3.3/5.0 with Borland C++ V3.x/4.0, Turbo C, or Microsoft C V6.0/7.0,
SunOS 4.1 with SUN or GNU C compilers, SGI IRIX 4.05, DEC Alpha OSF/1, and
VMS 5.5 with VAX C.  Other comparable ANSI C compilers should work as well.
