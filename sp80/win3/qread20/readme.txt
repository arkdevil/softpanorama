QRead lets you read text files quickly and easily in the Microsoft 
Windows  3.1 environment. Show text files of any size in any font 
you choose, and pump up the font with a single keystroke.  If you wish, 
QRead will automatically adjust the font size or the line breaks
to fit the window. 

QRead helps you keep track of the files you read with reading lists. 
A list stores descriptions of your files, and each description can be 
hundreds of characters long, not just an 8 character file name and a 
3 character extension.  When you're looking for a file, browse the 
reading list or use the Find command to search your list (or lists).  
Once you've read the description, open the chosen file with one click 
of the mouse.

Qread provides tools to make reading easier.  For example, set a QRead 
timer to automatically turn the page, or to remind you to turn the page.  
Filter out non-alphanumeric characters, search for a text string, place 
a bookmark, and copy information to and from the clipboard. You can also 
print and delete files from within QRead. The Entry/Exit behavior and 
the display settings of QRead can be customized and remembered on a 
file-by-file basis.
