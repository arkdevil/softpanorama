.\QRHELP.TXT
 This file is the QRead user manual.  It is a text version of the QRead help file. Note that the path name shown above (.\QRHELP.TXT) uses "relative addressing."  Normally, you will use a full path name so QRead can files anywhere on your disk(s).  In this case, I wasn't sure where you might install the QRead files.  

C:\QREAD\REGISTER.TXT
 This is the registration form for QRead.  It's one of my favorite files!  Note that the path name shown above (C:\QREAD\REGISTER.TXT) will be correct only if you installed into C:\QREAD.  If you did not, use the List | Rename current item command to reflect the location of your REGISTER.TXT file.
