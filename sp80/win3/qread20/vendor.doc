Vendor.doc - distribution policy for QRead

Anyone distributing QRead for any kind of remuneration must 
first contact DS Products at the address below for 
authorization. This authorization will be automatically 
granted to distributors recognized by the ASP as adhering to 
its guidelines for shareware distributors, and such 
distributors may begin offering QRead immediately. DS 
Products must still be advised, however, so that the 
distributor can be kept up to date with the latest version 
of QRead.

In general, distribution of QRead will be authorized 
as long as the total price to the end user of QRead is not 
excessive.  That is, the charge for distribution must not 
be so large compared to the registration fee that users are 
discouraged from registering.  When contacting DS Products 
for authorization, please specify the total price of QRead 
to the end user under your distribution system.
