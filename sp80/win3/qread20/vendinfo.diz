===== Information for Users ("READ-ME") ================

This archive contains the following files:

  QREAD.EXE    - the program QRead
  QREAD.HLP    - the help file for QRead
  QRHELP.TXT   - the help file (and user manual for QRead) as a text file
  SAMPLE.QRL   - a sample reading list
  TODO.QRL     - a sample list

  README.TXT   - this file (which lists the contents of this archive)
  README.BAT   - batch file containing the command "type readme.txt |
 more"

  REGISTER.TXT - form to be used when registering QRead
  FILE_ID.DIZ  - a fixed format description for Bulletin Board Systems
  VENDINFO.DIZ - machine readable information for software vendors
  VENDOR.DOC   - information for software vendors

  SETUP.EXE    - the QRead setup (installation) program

QRead lets you read text files quickly and easily in the Microsoft
Windows  3.1 environment. Show text files of any size in any font
you choose, and pump up the font with a single keystroke.  If you wish,
QRead will automatically adjust the font size or the line breaks
to fit the window.

QRead helps you keep track of the files you read with reading lists.
A list stores descriptions of your files, and each description can be
hundreds of characters long, not just an 8 character file name and a
3 character extension.  When you're looking for a file, browse the
reading list or use the Find command to search your list (or lists).
Once you've read the description, open the chosen file with one click
of the mouse.

Qread provides tools to make reading easier.  For example, set a QRead
timer to automatically turn the page, or to remind you to turn the page.
Filter out non-alphanumeric characters, search for a text string, place
a bookmark, and copy information to and from the clipboard. You can also
print and delete files from within QRead. The Entry/Exit behavior and
the display settings of QRead can be customized and remembered on a
file-by-file basis.

QRead is a Shareware program.  All rights are retained by the author.
You may share the program and freely distribute it for evaluation
purposes. After a reasonable evaluation period, you must register your
copy of the program and become a licensed user, or destroy your copy of
the program.

===== Installation =====================================

The simplest installation of QRead consists of one step -- copy the file
QREAD.EXE to your disk. You can use this method if you want to minimize
the effect of QRead on your hard disk.  No other files are necessary to
get started, but you might want to copy the help file, too.

In prior versions of QRead, I recommended copying the help file,
QREAD.HLP, to your Windows directory. Now I recommend leaving it in the
same directory with QREAD.EXE, in order to minimize the amount of files
in your Windows directory.

The setup program, SETUP.EXE,  provided with the QRead package is also
fairly quick and intended to be more user friendly.  It automates the
installation process, copying all the QRead files (there aren't that
many) to the directory you choose, and setting up a program item in the
Windows Program Manager.  If you want to install QRead manually, copy
the QRead files to your chosen directory and then create the program
item by following the instructions in the section Windows Program
Manager.

The first time you enter QRead it will use default settings. The first
time you exit QRead it will save the environment that you have in place
at the time of exit. This environment is stored in the file QREAD.INI in
your windows directory. QREAD.INI is the only file that QRead must write
to your disk. If you choose to store settings information, other files
will be written.  See the section on QRead Settings and the commands
Entry / Exit, and  Store settings for file for more information.

If you want to deinstall QRead, follow these steps.

1)  Delete QREAD.EXE and the other QRead files from the QRead directory.

2)  Delete the following files from your Windows directory:

     QREAD.INI
     QREAD.CUS
     QREAD.CBS
     QREADING.QRL

QREAD.CUS will exist if you issued the command Options | Save custom
settings.  QREAD.CBS will exist if you save the clipboard wind settings.

QREADING.QRL will exist if you issued the command List | Open Reading
List.

3)  Delete all the settings files (.QFS), reading list files (.QRL), and
list backup files (.QBK) that you or QRead have created.

4)  Delete the QRead program item and program group from the Windows
Program Manager.


===== Warranty =========================================

Users of QRead must accept this disclaimer of warranty: "QRead is
supplied as is.  The author disclaims all warranties, expressed or 
implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of 
merchantability and of fitness for any purpose. The author assumes no 
liability for damages, direct or consequential, which may result from 
the use of QRead."



===== License for Use and Distribution =================

QRead is a Shareware program and is provided at no charge to the user
for EVALUATION.  All rights are retained by the author. You may
share the program and distribute it for evaluation purposes, but you may
not give it away altered or as part of another system.  After a
reasonable evaluation period, 30 days, you must register your copy of
the program and become a licensed user, or destroy your copy of the
program.

To register and order your single-user license, send your name, address
and the license fee of $23 (US) to:

    DS Products
    P.O. Box 342
    Westford, MA  01886

Residents of Massachusetts must add sales tax of 5%.

You can also order by credit card. We have contracted for order taking
service with the firm Public (software) Library, PsL. PsL will notify us
the day of your order and we will ship the product directly to you.
Order with MC, Visa, Amex, or Discover from PsL by calling

    800-242-4775 or 713-524-6394
    or by FAX to 713-524-6398

THE ABOVE NUMBERS ARE FOR CREDIT CARD ORDERS ONLY.

The author cannot be reached at these numbers. Any questions, such
as questions about the status of the shipment of the order, product
details, technical support, dealer pricing, site license pricing,
non-credit card orders, etc, MUST be directed to DS Products.

The fee noted above will license one copy for use on any one
computer at any one time. You must treat the licensed software just
like a book.  An example is that this software may be used by any
number of people and may be freely moved from one computer
location to another, so long as there is no possibility of it being used
at one location while it's being used at another, just as a book cannot
be read by two different persons at the same time. Site License
arrangements may be made by contacting DS Products.

Registered users will receive:
    support (via CompuServe [70731,1673] or regular mail),
    minor upgrades at NO charge,
    major upgrades at a reduced price,
    additional goodies, such as discount offers or companion programs,
    a key that disables the registration reminder window, and
    a clear conscience.

Anyone distributing QRead for any kind of remuneration must obtain
authorization from DS Products at the address above. This
authorization will be automatically granted to distributors recognized
by the ASP as adhering to its guidelines for shareware distributors, and
such distributors may begin offering QRead immediately. Any distribution
satisfying all the distribution requirements expressed in the attached
VENDINFO data record is hereby authorized. DS Products must still be
advised, however, so that the distributor can be kept up to date with
the latest version of QRead.

The essence of Shareware is to provide users with quality software
without high prices, and yet to provide incentive for programmers to
continue to develop new products. Shareware is a distribution method
that allows you to try before you buy. Shareware has the ultimate money
back guarantee -- if you don't use the product, you don't pay for it.




===== About VENDINFO Files =============================

Each VENDINFO.DIZ file contains extensive information about a product.
This "human-readable" section is followed by a compressed data record
useable by automated tools.  The data record allows BBSes and other
distributors to automate package handling, and provides users with a
wealth of product information.  VENDINFO tools (free viewer for users,
free or inexpensive processors for distributors, editors for authors)
are available from many BBSes, disk vendors, and other sources.
