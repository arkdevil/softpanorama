 ║▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒ Chapter 1.    Installation and Configuration ▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒║
 ╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

   This chapter describes how to install and configure RAR,
   as well as giving information on technical requirements.

   1.1. Installation procedure

   RAR is distributed as a self-extracting (SFX) archive named
   RAR???.EXE for DOS version or RAR???P.EXE for OS/2 version
   where '???' is the version number.

   Local language versions may also be available in the format RARnnnxx.exe
   where "nnn" is the version number and "xx" is the country code.

   1.1.1. RAR for DOS installation

   RAR for DOS installation consists of three basic steps:-

   ..  Start the RAR Self-Extracting archive

   ..  Choose a directory for the RAR files

   ..  Initiate the RAR installation

   For example, on floppy disk A: you have the file
   RAR200.EXE, this will be RAR version 2.00.  You may install
   it to your C: disk by typing, at the DOS prompt, the following
   command (executing the RAR self-extracting archive):

   C:\> A:RAR200

   You will be prompted with the RAR archive comment.  Press
   any key to continue, or press ESC to cancel the extraction.

   Then you will enter the RAR installation menu.

   Choose "Read license" to view the RAR license for usage and
   distribution.  Pressing <Esc> to return to the installation menu.

   Choose "Destination directory" to enter the path for
   installation.

   Choose "Install" to extract the RAR files to the destination
   directory.

   When the extraction is successfully completed, a number of files will
   be placed in the destination directory and RAR will be ready for use.

   1.1.2. RAR for OS/2 installation

   RAR for OS/2 installation consists of three basic steps:-

   ..  Create a directory for the RAR files

   ..  Make this directory the current working directory

   ..  Execute the RAR Self-Extracting archive


   For example, on floppy disk A: you have the file
   RAR200P.EXE, this will be RAR version 2.00 for OS/2.  You may
   install it to your C: disk by typing, at the OS prompt, the
   following commands:

   [C:\] mkdir RAR
   [C:\] cd RAR
   [C:\RAR]

   You have now created a new directory, C:\RAR, and it is
   the current working directory.

   Then execute the RAR self-extracting archive:

   [C:\RAR] A:RAR200P

   You will be prompted with the RAR archive comment.  Press
   any key to continue, or press ESC to cancel the extraction.

   When the extraction is successfully completed, a number of
   files will be placed in the current directory and RAR will
   be ready for use.

   1.1.3. Installation hints

   The archiver program itself is named RAR.EXE. This module contains
   all of the archiver's functionality, packing, unpacking, repairing,
   SFX creation etc.

   It is recommended that the name of the directory, containing
   the RAR files, be added to the PATH environment variable.
   This will enable RAR to be used from any directory.
   Alternatively the critical modules of RAR may be copied to your
   "Utilities" directory.  These modules are RAR.EXE and RAR.CFG
   (RAR.EXE, RAR2.CFG and RARARC2.CFG for OS/2 version),
   although it is not essential, you may copy UNRAR.EXE as well.


   1.2. Option menu

   A number of RAR options may be configured and saved to
   be used as default options.  To access this menu, start RAR
   without any parameters and then press Function key 9 (F9) to
   bring up the Options menu:


   C:\RAR> RAR

   When RAR has been started, press F9 - the following menu
   will appear:

          ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
          │ Configuration...                │
          │ Set password              ALT-P │
          │ Work directory            ALT-W │
          │ Default comment file            │
          │ External viewer                 │
          │ Change disk               ALT-D │
          │ Registration                    │
          │ Save options              ALT-S │
          └─────────────────────────────────┘

   Press <Enter> for the sub-menu "Configuration".  The
   configuration menu offers a number of basic options which
   may be changed.

   In the configuration menu, use the arrow keys to move
   from item to item.  An item value may be changed by hitting
   the <space> key.  When all items are set as desired, move to
   the "Ok" field and hit <Enter> to save the chosen values.
   To discard any changes, move to the "Cancel" field and hit
   <Enter>.

   If you have a mouse attached, this process is even
   easier.  Simply move the mouse cursor to the desired item
   and click the left mouse key.
   When you have completed the configuration, move the mouse
   cursor to the field " Ok " and click on the left mouse key.
   To discard changes click the left mouse key on the " Cancel "
   field.


   "Configuration/Interface options"

     Color                  Selects/Deselects color in
                            full-screen mode

     Sound                  Enables RAR's sound effects

     Stdout mode            Forces RAR to run in console
                            (stdout) mode while processing
                            commands from the command line

     Mouse                  Enables the use of mouse-support
                            in full-screen mode


   "Configuration/Archiving options"

     Always solid           Forces RAR to create solid archives which
     archiving              are often very much smaller than "normal"
                            archives.  See RAR_FAQ.TXT for more details.
                            Default is ON and all created archives will
                            be made in 'solid' mode.  If you are making
                            archives which will be frequently updated,
                            the speed of update will be increased by
                            changing this option, at the expense of
                            compression ratio.

     Multimedia             Enables special compression algoritm
     compression            designed for digital audio and some
                            types of graphic. See '-mm' description
                            for details.

     Put recovery record    If this option is selected RAR will
                            add recovery record to any new or modified
                            archive. See 'rr' command description
                            for details.

 {+} Put Authenticity       Forces RAR to place -AV (Authenticity
     verification           Verification) into archives when they are
                            created. (This feature is only available in
                            the registered version)


   "Configuration/Compression"

   Choose the default compression level from one of the
   following:

      Store ...... Do not compress file when adding to archive
      Fastest .... Use fastest method (least compressive)
      Fast ....... Use fast compression method
      Normal ..... Use normal (default) compression method
      Good ....... Use good compression method (more compressive)
      Best ....... Use best compression method (most compressive)

   Default is 'Normal' and is chosen as the best compromise between
   time taken and compression ratio achieved.  Marginally higher
   (0.1% - 1.5%) compression may be achieved with 'Good' or 'Best',
   at the expense of 10% - 100% longer processing time.


   "Configuration/Include file mask"

   Choose the categories of files to be included when adding
   to an archive from the following:

       Read only files ..... Add files with 'Read-only' attribute
       System files ........ Add files with 'System' attribute
       Archive files ....... Add files with 'Archive' attribute
       Hidden files ........ Add files with 'Hidden' attribute

   Default is 'Read-Only, System, Archive or Hidden' and is used such
   that ALL files in a directory will be archived if the general
   wildcard (*.*) is used.


   "Configuration/Sort order"

   Choose the method required for sorting the archive contents
   list from one of the following:

        Unsorted ......... Do not sort files
        By name .......... Sort files by name
        By extension ..... Sort files by extension
        By size .......... Sort files by size

   Default is 'Sort files by extension' and is chosen in order to
   group like files closer together.


   For more information on file attributes, please refer to your
   DOS manual.


   "Configuration/Other options"

     Use 386 instructions   Forces RAR to detect CPU type and use some
                            386 CPU 32-bit instructions if appropriate
                            processor (386 or higher) is available.
                            This option presents only in DOS version
                            because RAR for OS/2 always uses 32-bit
                            instructions.

     Use expanded memory    Allows 64 Kb of expanded memory (EMS 4.0)
                            usage. Present only in DOS version.


     Save extended          Enables the saving of OS/2 extended
     attributes             attributes. Present only in OS/2 version.

 {+} Log errors to file     Enables the logging of critical errors
                            to a file RAR.LOG. (This feature is only
                            available in the registered version)


   "Set password"

   Assign a password which will used when you add/extract files
   to/from an archive.  You can define the password using <Alt-P>.
   Note, the password will not be saved to the configuration file.


   "Work directory"

   The path where RAR will place temporary files.  This may
   be changed at any time by pressing <Alt-W>.


   "Default comment file"

   If you would like a common comment added to every archive you are
   creating, enter the full path and name here.


   "External viewer"

   You may assign an external viewer program to run for viewing
   file in archives (by pressing <F3>).

   While viewing a file of the archive in full-screen mode
   RAR uses internal viewer if external viewer not set.

   Internal viewer provides the partial (dynamic) extraction
   of the file. It means the viewer extracts only those part
   which should read in view at the moment, then next one
   if needed, etc.

   While using external viewer the whole file is extracted
   before actual view.

   "Change disk"

   You may change the current disk displayed in the work window.


   "Registration"

   To register RAR you must have a registration code.  This code may
   be obtained by sending the completed registration form to your
   local registration site or the world-wide distribution center.

   You will receive the latest version of RAR in registered form
   along with your registration key and will then be able to create
   archives containing Authenticity verification.


   "Save setup"

   Pressing <Enter> or clicking the left mouse key on this item
   will pop up a small confirmation window in which the user is
   invited to " Save " or " Cancel " the saving of the new
   configuration for future default usage in RAR.

   RAR stores the default configuration in the file RAR.CFG, which
   is held in the same directory as RAR.EXE.

   The configuration may also be saved by pressing ALT-S keys,
   (pressing the "S" key while simultaneously holding down the "ALT"
   key).

   These options may also be set by using the left mouse key in the
   window "Settings":

                   │   Default comment file    Absent    │
                   └─────────────────────────────────────┘

   For example, click the left mouse key on the word 'Absent' in
   the setting 'Password', you will be prompted to enter a new
   password. Clicking the left mouse key on the word 'Optional'
   in the setting 'Make solid archives' would cause toggle to
   'Always' - that will force RAR to create solid archives.


   1.3. RAR environment variable

   Default parameters may be added to the RAR command line by
   establishing an environment variable, using the DOS "SET" command.

   Examples:

   C:\> SET RAR=-std -s

   RAR will use this string as default parameters in the command
   line.

   RAR handles options with priority as following:

       command line switches              highest priority
       switches in the RAR variable       lower priority
       options saved in RAR.CFG           lowest priority

   Switches -sfx, -v, -s, -std from RAR variable have no effect in
   full-screen mode.


   1.4. Technical requirements (DOS version only)

   Minimum DOS version to run RAR: 3.0

   Minimum memory requirements to perform commands and corresponding
   operations (in Kbytes) are:-

   If available memory by 32 Kb more than minimal requrements
   compression speed will increase. Compression ratio also
   may slightly increase.

   Generally the use of wildcards ('*' and '?') in an archive name or
   argument list from an external file (also with '-x' feature) will
   require extra memory.

   For extracting from and updating non-RAR archives add the memory
   requirements of the external archiver.


   1.5. The external archiver configuration file - RARARC2.CFG
        (OS/2 version only)

   The configuration file RARARC2.CFG is intended to define external

   Actually it contains three sections for these archivers.
   The information how to set up this file is placed in it's comments.


   1.6. Errorlevels

 ╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝


   When you execute the command "RAR" at the Dos prompt, you
   are presented with the full-screen interface - this is known
   as RAR's interactive full-screen mode.

   For example, you enter:

   C:\> RAR

   On the right hand side of the opening screen, you will be
   presented with a dialogue box containing the memory
   status and settings window.  This information includes:
   current compression method, password status (present or
   absent), multimedia compression (enabled/disabled),
   add recovery record (enabled/disabled), authenticity verification
   status (enabled/disabled), default comment file .. present or not.
   OS/2 version settings also include priority and sleep time,
   save extended attributes (enabled/disabled) and dictionary size.

   On the left-hand side of the screen you are presented with a
   list of files in the current directory. You can move the cursor
   through the files on the screen by using cursor keys or
   clicking the left mouse button.

   Pressing <Enter> when the cursor is positioned on a
   directory, up-directory ("..") or archive file name, will
   cause entry to be made to that item.

   The following archive types are recognized by RAR:
   .RAR, .ARJ, .ZIP and .LZH.

   Entering an archive, causes the files within the archive
   to be displayed in a similar manner to a directory listing.

   It is therefore possible to "walk through" directories and
   archive files, managing files both in archives and normal
   directories.

   In "directory" mode, the bottom like of the screen contains
   a menu of functions provided by the function keys.

1-Help 2-Add 3-View 4-Fresh 5-Volume 6-Move 7-Update 8-Delete 9-Option 0-Quit

   The line indicates that you may obtain help by pressing
   <F1>, add files to an archive by pressing <F2>, view files by
   pressing <F3> etc. Press <F10> to quit. These functions are
   the main command set when you are in a directory (not in
   archive).

   Alternatively, pressing and holding down the <ALT> key
   will cause the display of additional functions:

1-  2-Solid 3-View.. 4-SFX 5-SFXVol 6-SolVol 7-SolSVl 8-Repair 9-SolSFX 0-

   This indicates that Pressing <ALT-F2> can be used to
   create a SOLID archive, <ALT-F3> to view an archive using the
   internal viewer, etc.

   Also shown, by holding down the <ALT> key, will be the
   options list:

   Alt-C ... Toggle between color and monochrome mode
   Alt-D ... Select drive
   Alt-J ... DOS shell
   Alt-M ... Select compression method
   Alt-P ... Set password
   Alt-S ... Save setup
   Alt-W ... Set work directory to store temporary files

   OS/2 version contains two additional options:

   Alt-A ... Select dictionary size
             (see -md<size> description for details)
   Alt-R ... Set task priority and sleep time
             (see ri<P>[:<S>] description for details)

   Pressing keys, other than those which indicate options and
   functions, will put RAR into speed search mode for file names.
   This feature can save a lot of keystrokes when looking for
   specific file names.

   Changing from a directory to an archive will automatically
   change the set of available functions to those which are
   more suitable to those circumstances.

   In "archive" mode the available functions line looks like:

1-Help 2-Test 3-View 4-Extr 5-Comment 6-ExCurD 7-SFX 8-Delete 9-Option 0-Quit

   This line indicates you may obtain help by pressing <F1>, test
   files in archive by pressing <F2>, view file by <F3> etc. Press
   <F10> to quit. These functions are the main set when you are
   inside (Entered-to) an archive.

   Alternatively, when holding down the <Alt> key, the
   following would be displayed:

1-    2-    3-View.. 4-ExtrTo 5-FilCmt 6-AddRec 7-Lock  8      9      0

   Files may be marked/unmarked by using the [Space], [Ins],
   or right mouse key. You may also mark/unmark file groups by
   wildcards (file mask) using the [Gray +] and [Gray -] keys on
   the numeric keypad.  Marking a directory, automatically marks
   all the sub-directories and files within it.

   The marked/unmarked status of a group of files can be
   reversed by using the [Gray *] key.  Marking or unmarking a
   file, or group of files, updates a highlighted status display
   line at the bottom of the screen.  This status line indicates
   the number of files marked and the total size in bytes
   (the file size of marked directories is not included in the
   summary file size).

   In full-screen mode, the use of the mouse is fully
   supported.  Use the left mouse key to move through a
   directory.  Click the left key twice to <Enter>.  Use the
   right key to mark files.  When entering text (archive
   name, password etc.) the left mouse key cancels the data entry
   operation and right mouse key confirms entered text.  Use
   the left mouse key to choose function commands (F1-F10) of
   menu items and options.

   2.2. In an archive

   Press [Enter] with the cursor on the archive name to expand
   the archive contents.  The same effect may be achieved with
   the command-line option "en".   (See Chapter 3, 'en' command)

   Once inside an archive, the list of files is displayed on
   the left side of the screen.  These files may be marked, just
   as files in a directory.

   An asterisk (*) to the left of a file name, indicates that
   the file is password encrypted.

   Below the list of files the status line is displayed.
   Status line contains information about size and number of
   selected files and directories or if no files are selected
   about the current marked file: name, and at the end of status
   line - compression method, dictionary size and ratio.

   The right-hand portion of the screen is given over to a
   dialogue box, which includes information on:  archive name
   and status, presence of comments, encrypted files, recovery
   record, authenticity verification, dictionary size, total number
   of files in the archive, file sizes, compression ratio,
   the minimum RAR version required to extract files and the
   host Operating System used to create the archive.

   For example:

   Dialogue Box:                    Meaning:

   Archive          EXAMPLE.RAR     archive name
   Archive type     Normal          not 'solid' archive

   Function keys actions:

     F1       Help information

     F2       Test archive (validate integrity)

     F3       View a file (if an external viewer is not set,
              the internal viewer will be used)

     F4       Extract files from archive with directory
              structure

     F5       Add a comment to the archive

     F6       Extract file(s) to current directory

     F7       Make Self-Extracting (SFX) archive

     F8       Delete file(s) from archive

     F9       Set up / Save options

     F10      Quit RAR

     ESC      Return from the archive

     Alt-F3   View a file (using the internal viewer)

     Alt-F4   Extract file(s) to an alternate path

     Alt-F5   Add individual file comment(s)

     Alt-F6   Add archive recovery record

     Alt-F7   Lock the archive preventing modifications


   When working with archive volumes in full-screen mode you
   must begin the process with the first volume, you will be prompted
   with a menu:

   "Proceed with all volumes from current"
   "Proceed with selected files only"

   Choose the method you wish to use to work with the volumes.

   When files are displayed which were split between archive
   volumes, the compressed size displayed refers to the
   compressed size on the current volume.  The symbol '<-'
   indicates that part of the file exists on a previous volume.
   The symbol '->' indicates that part of the file exist on the
   next volume. You can change to the previous or next volume
   by pressing corresponding arrow keys (left or right).

   2.3. In a non-RAR archive

   In full-screen mode RAR offers the management of non-RAR archives.
   Supported non-RAR archive types are ZIP, ARJ and LZH.

   RAR provides the following operations for non-RAR archives:

    - extract files, creating the directory structure;
    - extract to the current directory;
    - extract to a specified directory;
    - test files in the archive;
    - delete files from the archive;
    - view contents of the archive in full-screen mode;
    - make SFX-archives;
    - add archive comment (ZIP and ARJ only);
    - add file comment (ZIP and ARJ only).

   Also the user may set a password for the archive (pressing Alt-P)
   and the path for temporary files (Alt-W).

   For viewing the archive contents the user will need only RAR.
   However for operations with non-RAR archives the user should
   have the corresponding programs (PKUNZIP, PKZIP, ZIP2EXE, ARJ,
   LHA, or specified in RARARC2.CFG for OS/2 version), also
   the path to these programs must be included in the PATH
   environment variable.

   You can use RAR as the archive manager for archives of all
   the above-mentioned types in shell programs such as Norton
   Commander.

   Note, RAR does not provide facilities for the management of
   non-RAR SFX archives.

   Only the standard LZH archive header is supported.  Archives
   created by LHA using the switch '/h2' are not supported.

 ╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

   Command line mode is the opposite of full-screen interactive mode.
   This mode is best used in batch files and requires no interaction.


   Usage:


    RAR <command> -<switch1> -<switchN> <archive> <files...>
        <@listfiles...> <path_to_extract\>

   All parameters must exist on the same, single command line.

   command      ..  The function to be performed by RAR, add,
                    extract, move etc.

   switch       ..  Switches used to define a specific type of
                    operation, compression strength, type of
                    archive etc.

   archive      ..  The name of the archive to be operated upon.

   files        ..  The files to be processed.

   listfiles    ..  The name of a file containing the names of
                    the files to be operated upon.

   path_to_extract  Used only with commands 'e' and 'x',
                    indicating the directory in which to
                    place extracted files.  If this directory
                    does not exist, it will be created. Please
                    note the OBLIGATORY use of the terminating
                    backslash character on this parameter.


   3.1. Commands (Alphabetic sequence)

   ..  a: add files to archive

   ..  c: add archive comment

       Pressing [F10] will save the entered comment and exit.
       Pressing [Esc] will cancel the comment.  Pressing [F10]
       without entering a comment will remove any existing
       comment.

       Comments are displayed while the archive is being
       processed.  The maximum comment length is 16384 bytes.

       Support for ANSI esc-sequences is provided in RAR which
       allows the use of color and cursor movements.  No ANSI
       driver is required to display such comments.

       Redefinition of the keyboard using ANSI esc-sequences is
       NOT supported and thus the so-called ANSI-bombs cannot be
       delivered using RAR.

    Example:

       RAR c distrib.rar

       Comments may be entered from a file by using the '-z<file>'
       switch before the name of the file containing the comment.

       RAR c -zinfo.txt dummy

   ..  cf: add file comments (not to entire archive)

       Pressing [F10] will save the entered comment and exit.
       Pressing [Esc] will cancel the comment.  Pressing [F10]
       without entering a comment will remove any existing
       comment.

       Comments are displayed when the 'v' command is given.
       Comment length is limited to 16384 bytes.

    Example:

       RAR cf bigarch *.txt

   ..  cw: write the archive comment to a file

    Example:

       RAR cw oldarch comment.txt

       The comment from the archive oldarch.rar will be
       written to the file comment.txt

   ..  d: delete files from archive

    Note: If the processing of this command resulted in
       removing all the files from the archive, the empty
       archive would removed.

   ..  e: extract files from archive to current directory

   ..  en: start RAR in full-screen mode and enter an archive

       Usually this command is included in the extension file
       of a shell processor such as Norton Commander:

       RAR: RAR en !.!

    Examples:

       RAR en disk1.rar

       RAR en puppy.zip

       The 'en' may also be omitted, simply start RAR with
       the archive name.

    Example:

       RAR baby.arj

   ..  f: freshen files in archive

       Updates those files changed since they were packed to
       the archive.  This command will not add new files to the
       archive.

   ..  k: lock archive

       Any commands that could change the archive will be
       ignored.

    Example:

       RAR k final.rar

   ..  l: list archive contents (brief listing)

       Files are listed as with the 'v' command with the
       exception of the file path.  i.e. only the file name
       is displayed.

   ..  m: move files and directories to archive

       Moving files and directories results in the files and
       directories being erased upon successful completion of
       the packing operation.  Directories will not be removed
       if '-ed' switch is used.

   ..  mf: move files to archive

        Moving files results in the files being erased upon
        successful completion of the packing operation.

   ..  p: print file(s) to screen (STDOUT)

   ..  r: repair damaged archive

       Archive repairing includes two stages. First, damaged
       archive is scanned for recovery record (see 'rr' command).
       If archive contains previously added recovery record and
       if portion of the damaged data is continuous and less than
       N*512 bytes, where N is number of recovery sectors placed into
       the archive, the chance of successful archive reconstruction
       is very high. When this stage has completed, a new archive
       will be created, called _RECOVER.RAR

       If damaged archive does not contain recovery record or
       if archive is not completely recovered because damages are
       too big, second stage is started. During this stage only
       archive structure is reconstructed and it is impossible to
       recover files which fail the CRC validation, but still
       is possible to recover undamaged files which inaccessible due
       to broken archive structure. Mostly it is useful for non-solid
       archives. In damaged solid archives usually only the first
       file can be really recovered during second stage.

       When this stage has completed, a new archive will be created,
       called _RECONST.RAR

       While the recovery process is in operation, RAR may
       prompt the user for assistance when suspicious files are
       located.

                      Suspicious entry

              Name:  <possibly filename>
              Size:  <size>    Packed: <compressed size>

                      Add it: Yes/No/All

    Answer 'Y' to add this entry to the file $RECOVER.RAR.

    Example:

       RAR r buggy.rar

   ..  rr[N]: add data recovery record

       Optionally, redundant information (recovery record) may be
       added to an archive, incurring a small penalty in archive size,
       which will help to recover archived files in the case of floppy
       disk failure or data losses of any other kind.
       Recovery record can contain up to 8 recovery sectors.
       Number of sectors may be specified directly in the 'rr' command
       (N = 1 .. 8) or if it is not specified by user it will be
       selected automatically depending from archive size:

                   Archive size       Number of sectors
                     < 50Kb                   2
                     50Kb-500Kb               4
                     > 500Kb                  8

       If damaged data is continuous then each sector is able to
       recover 512 bytes of damaged information, but this value
       may decrease for multiple damages.

       Size of recovery record can be approximately calculated as
       <archive size>/256 + <number of recovery sectors>*512 bytes.


   ..  s: convert archive to a Self-Extracting (SFX) type.

       In the Dos environment, this will create a *.EXE file
       which, when executed, will extract the files contained
       within it.

       It is also possible to make an SFX archive as the first
       of a multi-volume sequence, but it should be noted that
       the size will be larger by the amount of the SFX-module.
       Please ensure that the first volume in the sequence is
       created with the correct size.

       Should SFX volumes be created using the command 'a' with
       the switches: '-v[<size>] -sfx', then you do not need to
       ensure the volume size - first volume will be automatically
       created with the proper size.

    Example:

        RAR s diamant

   ..  s<file.sfx>: convert archive to a Self-Extracting (SFX) type
       using alternate SFX module

       You may indicate an alternate SFX module (pathname) to build
       the SFX archive.

       For instance the Installation SFX:

       RAR sidos.sfx myinst
       RAR c -zscript.s myinst

       See the Installation SFX documentation, SFX.DOC, for details
       of the command language of the installation SFX.

   ..  t: test archive files

       This command performs a dummy file extraction, writing
       nothing to the output stream, in order to validate the
       specified file(s).

   ..  u: update files in archive

       Adds files not already in the archive and updates those
       files changed since they were packed to the archive.

   ..  v: verbosely list archive content (full listing)

       Files are listed using the format: full pathname, file
       comment, original and compressed size, compression ratio,
       last update date and time, attributes, CRC, compression
       method and minimum RAR version required to extract.

       To list the contents of all archive volumes, use and
       asterisk (*) in place of the archive file extension.

    Example:

        RAR v multivol.*

   ..  x: extract files from archive to original (relative)
          directory if pathnames exist in the archive

    Command limitations:

       The commands 'd','u','f' will not operate with archive
       volumes.

       The command 'a' cannot be used to update an archive
       volume, only to create one.

       The commands 'c' and 'cf' will not operate with
       archive volumes, but will work with solid archives.


   3.2. Switches  (Alphabetic sequence)

   ..  -?  display help on commands and switches

   ..  -$[drive]  provide volume label support

       When adding to an archive the switch causes the adding of the
       volume label of the current or specified disk drive to the
       archive. When extracting from the archive the switch instructs
       RAR to set the volume label from the archive to the specified
       disk drive or, if not specified, to the drive on which
       extraction has been processed.

       Volume labels are ignored in SFX and the UNRAR utility.

   ..  -av  apply authenticity verification (registered versions only)

       RAR will put, in every new and updated archive,
       information concerning the creator, last update time and
       archive name.

       If an archive, containing authenticity verification, is
       being modified and this switch is not specified, the
       authenticity verification information will be removed.

       When extracting, testing, listing or updating and
       archive with the '-av' switch, RAR will perform integrity
       validation and display the message:

            Verifying authenticity information ...

       In the case of successful authenticity verification, the
       message 'Ok', creator name and last update information
       will be displayed.  In the case of authenticity verification
       failure, the message 'FAILED' will be displayed.

       When creating archive volumes with the '-av' switch,
       Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) information will be added to
       each volume.

       The Authenticity Verification feature, '-av,' is
       recommended for use with archives in a software
       distribution environment.

       In order to enable the Authenticity verification feature,
       the program MUST be registered.  Please contact your local
       distribution site or the world-wide distribution center.

   ..  -av-  disable checking or adding authenticity verification

   ..  -b   enable backup archives

       This switch will create a backup before an archive is
       modified.  The backup file will have the same name as the
       original archive but with the .BAK extension.  Should this
       file already exist, the backup file will be named with a
       .$BK extension.

   ..  -bw  black & white (monochrome) mode

   ..  -c-   disable comment display

   ..  -cfg- disable read configuration and environment

   ..  -col  color mode

   ..  -dh   disable sharing files

       This helps when accessing files open by other applications
       on networks or multi-tasking environment.

   ..  -ds   do not sort files while adding to a solid archive

   ..  -e<s,h,a,r> set file exclusion attributes

       The switches 's', 'h', 'a' or 'r' signify that files
       having the System, Hidden, Archive or Read only attributes
       should be excluded.  The order in which the attributes are
       given is not significant.

    Example:

       RAR a -ehs purity *.exe

       Do NOT add files with Hidden or System attributes.

   ..  -ed  do not add empty directories

       This switch indicates that empty directories are not
       to be stored in the created archive.

   ..  -ems-  disable EMS usage (DOS version only)

   ..  -ee  disable extended attributes saving (OS/2 version only)

   ..  -ep  exclude paths from names

       This switch enables files to be added to an archive
       without including the path information.  This could, of
       course, result in multiple files existing in the archive
       with the same name.

   ..  -ep1 exclude base dir from names

       Do not store the path from the command line.

       Example:

          RAR a -ep1 -r pasta tmp\*.*

       All files and directories from the directory TMP will
       be added to the archive 'pasta', but the path will not
       include 'TMP\'.  This is equivalent to the commands:

         cd tmp
         RAR a -ep1 -r pasta
         cd ..

   ..  -f   freshen files

       May be used with archive extraction or creation.

       The command string "a -f" is equivalent to the command
       'f', you could also use the switch '-f' with the commands
       'm' or 'mf'.  If the switch '-f' is used with the commands
       'x' or 'e', then only old files would be replaced with new
       versions extracted from the archive.

   ..  -ialt  Disables the changing, by pressing the left Alt key,
       the context function key information in the bottom line of
       the screen (in full-screen mode).  This helps some users who
       wished to use certain TSRs while in RAR.  The action of the
       left and right function keys are in other respects,
       unchanged.  This may be permanently configured by adding the
       switch to the RAR environment variable (SET in autoexec.bat)
       with SET RAR=-ialt

   ..  -m<0..5> set compression method

       -m0   store     do not compress file when adding to
                       archive
       -m1   fastest   use fastest method (less compressive)
       -m2   fast      use fast compression method
       -m3   normal    use normal (default) compression method
       -m4   good      use good compression method (more
                       compressive, but slower)
       -m5   best      use best compression method (sightly more
                       compressive, but slowest)

       By default RAR uses -m3 method (Normal compression).

   ..  -md<size>: select dictionary size in Kb (OS/2 version only)
           size must be equal to 64, 128, 256, 512 or 1024

       Sliding dictionary is a special memory area used by the
       compression algorithm. If size of file to archive (or the size
       of all files to pack when creating solid archive) more than
       dictionary size then greater dictionary size usually will
       increase compression ratio significantly. Though it will lower
       packing speed and cause higher memory requirements.

       Default sliding dictionary size in Unix version of RAR is 256
       Kb. In versions of RAR for Unix, OS/2 and some other platforms
       it is possible to select five different sizes: 64, 128, 256, 512
       or 1024 Kb. Besides, speed of extraction in these versions does
       not depend upon dictionary size. In version of RAR for DOS the
       sliding dictionary size is fixed and equal to 64 Kb. Though RAR
       for DOS provides extracting files from large dictionary archives
       with conventional memory, EMS and disk usage. If no EMS and disk
       cache are available operation may slow down significantly. RAR
       for DOS cannot convert large dictionary archives to SFX with the
       default SFX module and cannot update such solid archives.

       Amount of memory to create large dictionary archives determined
       as 5*<dictionary size>+150Kb. About 1 Mb required for extraction
       and 5*<dictionary size>+1150Kb to update solid archives.


    Example:

       RAR a -s -md512 sources *.asm

       Will create solid archive with 512 Kb dictionary.

   ..  -mm multimedia compression

       Enables special multimedia compression algorithm. It is intended
       to compress digital audio data containing up to four 8-bit or
       two 16-bit channels. It works good with a true color (24-bit)
       bitmaps as well. Improvement in the compression ratio up to 30%
       over the normal compression may be achieved.

       When archiving file in the multimedia mode rar performs
       intelligent data analysis and may use for different file parts
       general or multimedia compression depending on which suits
       better. Such analysis allows to reach optimum performance when
       different data types are merged in the file. The 'f' modifier
       forces the multimedia compression to be used for whole file; it
       may help when certain multimedia files are to be compressed, but
       in most cases it only increase archive size.

       Both the -m<N> "Set compression method" and -s "Create solid
       archive" switches could be applied with multimedia compression,
       but they are in effect for those file parts where general
       algorithm works.

       If -mm is used with non-multimedia data, compression ratio
       usually is not changed in comparison with general method or
       changed not significantly but due to multimedia analysis
       overhead the packing speed is always slower. Then the usage of
       -mm is not recommended with common data files.

       Note: multimedia compression designed only for a certain file
       type. It works good with WAV, STM, MOD, true color bitmaps,
       but useless to compress MID, GIF, JPG or 8-bit bitmaps.

    Example:

       RAR a -m5 -s -mm songs *.wav

   ..  -mmf force multimedia compression

       This switch works like -mm with one exception: it always
       compress all files as multimedia independing from multimedia
       analysis results. Usually it leads to worse compression
       ratio but can be useful in the hypotetical case when
       RAR cannot correctly detect multimedia file.

   ..  -o+ overwrite existing files

   ..  -o- do not overwrite existing files (default)

   ..  -p<password> set password

   ..  -p  set password

       The password is case-sensitive. If you omit the
       password on the command line, you will be prompted with:

       Enter password:

    Example:

       RAR a -pmyhoney secret *.txt

       Newly added files will be encrypted with the password
       'myhoney'.

   ..  -r recurse subdirectories

       May be used with commands: a,u,f,m,x,e,t,p,v,l,c,cf,s.

       When used with the commands 'a', 'u', 'f', 'm' will
       process files in all sub-directories as well as the
       current working directory.

       When used with the commands x,e,t,p,v,l,c,cf,s will
       process all archives in sub-directories as well as the
       current working directory.

   ..  -ri<P>[:<S>] set priority and sleep time (OS/2 version only)

       This option is intended to regulate system load by RAR
       in the multitasking environment.

       The task priority <P> (possible values, 0 to 128) conforms
       to the corresponding OS/2 concept.  Values of <P> are grouped
       into the following groups:

                 <P> value      OS/2 <priority class>:<priority level>
                    0                OS/2 default (i.e. 2:0, or <P>=33)
                   1-32              1:0-1:31
                  33-64              2:0-2:31
                  65-96              3:0-3:31
                  97-128             4:0-4:31

       When <P> is equal to 0, the default OS/2 task priority is used.

       The sleep time <S> is a value from 0 to 1000 (milliseconds).
       This is the period of time that RAR will give back to OS/2
       after every read or write during the packing or unpacking
       operation.  The sleep time setting is useful when several tasks
       with the same priority are running in the system.

    Example:

       RAR a -r -sfx -ri0:100 backup *.*

       Execute RAR with default priority and 100 ms sleeping
       after each read or write.

   ..  -rr[N]: add data recovery record

       If this switch is used when creating or modifying archive,
       a data recovery record will be added to the resulting archive.
       See command 'rr[N]' description for details.

   ..  -s   create solid archive

       Solid is a special archive type.  Please refer to the
       appendix "Glossary" for further information.

    Example:

       RAR a -s -v1440 -sfx maddy *.*

       Will create solid Self-Extracting (SFX) volumes of
       size 1440000 bytes.

   ..  -sfx create Self-Extracting (SFX) archive

       If this switch is used when creating a new archive, a
       Self-Extracting archive would be created.

    Example:

       RAR a -sfx sources *.asm

       This command would create a Self-Extracting archive
       named SOURCES.EXE.  To extract files from such an archive,
       you would simply execute it.  Self-Extracting archives may
       be processed normally using RAR.

   ..  -sfx<file.sfx> create Self-Extracting (SFX) archive using
       alternate SFX module.

   Example:

       RAR a -sfxidos.sfx -zscript.s myinst

       See the Installation SFX documentation, SFX.DOC for details.

   ..  -std  stdout mode

       All output text is sent to the stdout stream.  This
       allows redirection of RAR output to a file, for example:

       RAR v -std bambam >bambam.lst

         or in 'silent' mode without any output:

       RAR x -std dime 10cents.txt >nul

       Note:  In stdout mode, if an archive comment exists, no delay
              will be implemented when the comment is displayed.

   ..  -tk  do not modify archive date

       Prevents RAR from modifying the archive date when
       changing an archive.

   ..  -tl  set archive date as the date of newest file

       Forces RAR to set the date of a changed archive to the
       date of the newest file in the archive.

   ..  -u   update files

       May be used with archive extraction or creation.

       The command string "a -u" is equivalent to the command
       'u', you could also use the switch '-u' with the commands
       'm' or 'mf'.  If the switch '-u' is used with the commands
       'x' or 'e', then files not present on the disk and files
       newer than their copies on the disk would extracted from
       the archive.

   ..  -v create volumes with autodetected size

   ..  -v<size> create archive volumes

       By default this switch uses <size> as thousands (1000) of
       bytes (not 1024 x bytes). You may also enter the size in
       kilobytes using the symbol 'k' or in bytes using the symbol
       'b' following the numerical value. If the size is omitted,
       autodetection will be used.

       If volumes are created on the same drive as the
       temporary files (current drive by default, but may be
       changed with the switch '-w'), the autodetected size
       becomes meaningless.  In this case the volume size must be
       explicitly defined.

       If volumes are created on a drive OTHER than the drive
       containing the temporary files, then after the first
       volume has been created, the user will be prompted with:

           Create next volume: Yes/No/All/Quit

       At this moment in time, you should change the disks.
       Answering 'A' will cause all volumes to be created without
       a pause.

       The first volume file in a multi-volume set has the
       extension .RAR, following volumes are numbered from .R00 to
       .R99.

       When extracting or testing a multi-volume archive you
       must use only the first volume name (*.RAR).  If there is
       no next volume on the drive (and volumes are not placed in
       the same directory as the temporary files), the user will
       be prompted with:

           Insert disk with <next volume name>

       Insert the disk with the correct volume and press any key.

       If while extracting, the next volume is not found and
       volumes are placed in the same directory as the temporary
       files, RAR will abort with the error message:

           Cannot find <volume name>
           Cannot change disk with temporary files

       Archive volumes may not be modified.  The commands 'd',
       'f', 'u', 's' can not be used with Multi-volume sets.
       The command 'a' may be used only for the creation of a
       new multi-volume sequence.

       It is possible, although unlikely, that the file size,
       of a file in a multi-volume set, could be greater than
       it's uncompressed size.  This is due to the fact that
       'storing' (no compression if size increases) cannot be
       enabled for multi-volume sets.

       Archive volumes may be Self-Extracting (SFX).  Such an
       archive should be created using both the '-v' and '-sfx'
       switches.


    Example:

    1. Archive drive C: on floppy drive A:

       RAR a -r -v a:allhard c:\*.*

    (current disk MUST NOT be a:)

    2. Create archive volumes with 1440000 byte size in current
       directory.

       RAR a -v1440 4flopp

       or

       RAR a -v1440 4flopp *.*

   .. -vd erase disk contents before creating volume

       All files and directories on the target disk will be erased
       when '-vd' is used.  The switch applies only to removable
       media, the hard disk cannot be erased using this switch.

   ..  -w<path> assign work directory

       This switch may be used to assign the directory for
       temporary files to another drive.  For example a RAM drive
       or high performance disc.

    Example:

       RAR a -we:\tmp bmps *.bmp

       Temporary files would be created in directory E:\TMP


   ..  -x<mask> exclude files specified by mask

    Example:

       RAR a -x*.bak purearch.rar

       You may specify the switch '-x' several times:

       RAR a -r -x*.arj -x*.rar rawfiles

   ..  -x@<list> exclude files using specified list file

    Example:

       RAR a -x@exlist.txt arch *.exe

   ..  -y   assume Yes on all queries

   ..  -z<file> add comment to archive


   3.3. SFX switches

    An SFX archive module can be handled by the switches:

   ..  -e   Extract from the SFX archive

       The switch is used by default similar to 'x' command in RAR.

   ..  -t   Test the SFX archive

       This is similar to 't' command in RAR.

   ..  -v   View the archive content

       This is similar to 'v' command in RAR.
