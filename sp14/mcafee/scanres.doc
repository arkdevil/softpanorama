		   VIRUSCAN - MEMORY RESIDENT VERSION    0.8V35
 
					From: McAfee Associates  408 988 3832

Introduction:

	Memory Resident VIRUSCAN identifies pre-existing virus
infections and prevents viruses from spreading throughout your
system.  It monitors and scans programs as they are loaded and
prevents infected programs from executing.  It also scans specific
areas of the system - the boot sector, partition table, hidden
files, Command Interpreter and itself, when it is first executed. 
	The memory resident module - SCANRES will identify the virus
strain which has caused the infection in all cases of the known
viruses.  It remains active in your system at all times after it
is loaded.
	VIRUSCAN version 0.8V35 can identify 34 major virus strains
and numerous sub-varieties for each strain.  The 34 viruses include
the twelve most common viruses which account for over 95% of all
reported PC infections.  These common viruses include:

		- Pakistani Brain
		- Jerusalem
		- Alameda
		- Cascade (1701/1704)
		- Ping Pong
		- Stoned
		- Lehigh
		- Den Zuk
		- Datacrime (1280/1168) 
		- Fu Manchu
		- Vienna (DOS 62)
		- April First

	Viruscan can also identify the 3066 virus (Traceback), the
Icelandic virus, the 405 virus, the Datacrime-2 virus and other
viruses that have been reported in Europe but have not caused
significant problems in the U.S. as yet.

	These viruses infect one of the following areas:  The hard
disk partition table; the DOS boot sector of hard disks or
floppies; or one or more executable files within the system.  The
executable files may be operating system programs, system device
drivers, .COM files, .EXE files, overlay files or any other file
which can be loaded into memory and executed.  SCANRES identifies
the area or file that has become infected and indicates the name
of the virus that has infected each area.  
	When an infection is identified, the VIRUSCAN non-resident
system scanner should be used to scan the entire system and
determine the extent of the infection.  If you do not have the
VIRUSCAN non-resident program, it may be downloaded from the
HomeBase BBS at 408 988 4004. 


Operation:

IMPORTANT: First place SCANRES on a write protected floppy prior
to installing it.  This will ensure a valid copy in the event that
the program becomes infected.

	To install SCANRES, place the following line as the FIRST
	entry in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

			SCANRES

	Then copy the file SCANRES.EXE to the root directory of your
	bootable hard drive (usually C:).
		

	SCANRES will then become active each time the system is
powered-on or re-booted.  It will check the critical areas of the
system for viruses, including itself, and then monitor all program
loads.  As programs are loaded, SCANRES will scan the programs
looking for viruses.  If a virus is found, SCANRES will display a
warning message and name the infection.  The infected program will
then be terminated.
	Unlike many memory resident virus filter programs, SCANRES
will not cause false alarms.  If a warning message is issued by
SCANRES, you can be assured the identified program is infected. 
Also, since it does not attempt to monitor file I/O or normal disk
accesses, it will not conflict with other memory resident programs.

SYSTEM OVERHEAD:
	SCANRES requires 17K of system memory.  It will add an average
of 8 seconds to each program load.  After a program has loaded and
begun execution, however, SCANRES will not degrade the performance
or speed of the system in any way.

Registration:

	A registration fee of $15 is required for the use of SCANRES.
Corporate site licenses are also available.  For site license

Virus Removal:

	What do you do if a virus is found?  Well, if you are a
registered VIRUSCAN or SCANRES user, you may contact McAfee
Associates for free assistance in manually removing the virus.  We
strongly recommend that you get experienced help in dealing with
many of the viruses, particularly partition table and boot sector
infections.  If you are not a registered user, the following steps
should be followed:

	Boot sector infections:
	Power down the system.  Power up and boot from an uninfected,
     write protected floppy.  Execute the DOS SYS command to
     attempt an overwrite of the boot sector.  This works in many
     cases.  If this does not work, backup all data files and
     perform a low level format of the disk.

	Executable file infections:
	Remove all infected files.  Replace from the original
     distribution diskettes.

	Partition table infections:
	Without a removal utility, the only option is to low level
     format the media.

	Disinfecting utilities are available from McAfee Associates
     for the majority of the common viruses.  If you are not a
     registered user of VIRUSCAN, you may purchase these utilities
