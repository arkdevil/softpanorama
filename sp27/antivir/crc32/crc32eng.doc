   Information authentication problem quickly becomes global.
   Algorithms using  Cyclic Redundancy Code (CRC) checking provide
a high level of data security.
   CRC processing is a extra powerful error checking technique but
is often  misunderstood because  of its  complexity. The excellent
CRC treatise  may be  found in  the old  manual of  Темников  Ф.Е.
"Теоретические   основы    информационно-измерительной   техники".
Москва, "Энергия", 1979.

   25SOFT presents the demo program for quickly CRC32 checking -

                              CRC32.EXE

   (when using  on the  standard 12  Mhz PC/AT  with 28ms ST251 HD
computing speed  is above  100Kb per  sec). As to calculated CRC32
value CRC32.EXE  is fully compatible with popular PKWARE programs.
High speed  of work  allows the  use of  CRC32.EXE to  detect  any
modifications in a big data quantities.

   You may  copy and  distribute CRC32.EXE with this documentation
at no charge (as FREEWARE).
