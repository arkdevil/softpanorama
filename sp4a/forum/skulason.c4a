There were two reviews published in British computer magazines this
month.  One (in PCW) was badly done - in fact, my opinion is that they
should officially apologize next month.

They used an incredibly small set of virus samples, modified the
infectedd programs in order to disable the viruses, and checked which
programs were still able to detect the viruses.  When they discovered
that some of the anti-virus programs did not detect some of the
viruses, they considered this highly significant and an indication
that the programs were not protecting the users.  My program was not
included in that review, so I don't have any reasons to be upset,
but.....

The other review (in PC Direct) is surprisingly well done - I am
personally quite satisfied with my outcome there, but according to
that review some of the anti-virus programs on the market are,
well...not quite as good as they should be, to say the least. In one
case the review starts like this:

     It is rare to find a program as bad as ....... The poor impressions
     started on opening the box, to reveal the software on two write-enabled
     disks. We write-protected them before installation, but the install
     procedure wanted us to remove the write protection to enable any viruses
     found to be cured.
     ...
     The program is incredibly tedious to use, requiring several keypresses
     between each disk or virus and there is no option to produce a printed
     report
     ...
     The monitor claimed to have detected a virus every time we loaded
     Windows 3.1
     ...
     The distributors offer unlimited free upgrades via BBS...We called the
     bulletin board: this turned out to be the "The Dog and Disk BBS" and we
     were greeted with the information that "Richard was in the bar"

Now, I usually don't like to say bad thing about my competition :-)
but in this case I just could not resist...
