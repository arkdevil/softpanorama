      CLARION SOFTWARE AND JPI. ANNOUNCE MERGER PLANS.
    ====================================================

( JPI = Jensen and Partners, International; suppliers of
  high quality optimizing compilers for MS-DOS machines:
  TopSpeed Modula-2, C, C++ and ISO Pascal ).

Clarion and JPI have announced an intent to merge the two
companies. Clarion develops database application development
tools for MS DOS including the Clarion Professional Developer.
JPI develops the TopSpeed family of language products that
includes optimizing compilers, link technology, an interactive
debugger and software development tools. JPI's compiler/link
technology is included in Clarion Professional Developer 3.0
(scheduled to ship in the first quarter of 92).

Niels Jensen said - "The integration of TopSpeed optimizing code
generator and a 4GL language will forever impact programming"

With the TopSpeed optimizing code generator included in Professional
Developer 3.0, the Internal computing speed of a Professional
Developer program is more than 200 times faster than
the same program created with FoxPro or Clipper, according to
benchmark comparisons conducted by Clarion software. With the
integration of TopSpeed's code generation technology, Clarion
Professional Developer 3.0 will offer an extremely efficient
vehicle for downsizing. Programs written with the 4GL Clarion
language will execute just as fast as those written in C or other
code, but will be smaller and easier to maintain.

... The  development staff of JPI will remain in London and will
be known as the TopSpeed Institute, which will continue to develop
and maintain leading-edge computer language products.
Finantical details of the merger were not disclosed.

In additional to the Clarion Professional Developer and Personal
Developer, Clarion Software markets the Clarion Report Writer, a
tool for creating customized ad-hoc reports and queries.
