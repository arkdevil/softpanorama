

A couple of example PASCAL programs have also been added to test
the resulting parser.

+ EXAM1.PAS implements a real algorithm -- greatest common divisor
  computation

+ EXAM2.PAS is intended to test nested IF statements

+ EXAM3.PAS is intended to test CASE statements

The reduction sequence for EXAM3.PAS is recorded in PASCAL.AST.
