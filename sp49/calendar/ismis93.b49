               SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM
         ON METHODOLOGIES FOR INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
           Trondheim, Norway, June 15-18, 1993


                       SPONSORS:
    Univ. of Trondheim (Norway), UNC-Charlotte (USA),
          Oak Ridge National Laboratory (USA).


PURPOSE OF THE SYMPOSIUM 

This Symposium is intended to attract individuals who are actively 
engaged both in theoretical and practical aspects of intelligent systems. 
The goal is to provide a platform for a useful exchange between 
theoreticians and practitioners, and to foster the cross-fertilization 
of ideas in the following areas:

 * Approximate Reasoning
 * Expert Systems
 * Intelligent Databases
 * Knowledge Representation
 * Learning and Adaptive Systems
 * Logic for Artificial Intelligence.

In addition, we solicit papers dealing with Decision Making and
Automatic Control. Papers presented at the symposium must describe 
work that has not previously been published or presented at a conference. 


ISMIS'93 Symposium Chairs: 

      Jan Komorowski (Norway) and Zbigniew W. Ras (USA)
