	DOSNIX is a collection of DOS utilities which have the look
    and feel of UNIX.  It is an excellent program for people who are
    familiar with UNIX and would like to have some of the power of UNIX
    on their DOS machine.  It is also a good program for people who are
    unfamiliar with UNIX but would like to learn.  Some of the utlities
    included with DOSNIX are:


    CP -     The UNIX counterpart of the DOS COPY command.  CP will
	     allow you to copy hidden and system files, and the DOSNIX
	     version will not overwrite existing files without warning
	     you.  CP also has options to utilize the archive bit or to
	     copy files interactively.

    CHMOD -  This version of the UNIX CHMOD command has been adapted
             to work with MSDOS file attributes.  It will allow you
             to change the attributes of any file and allow you to
	     create read only, hidden and system files.

    FFIND -  FFIND is a file locater in the tradition of the UNIX FIND
	     command.  Although FFIND does not have the power and scope
	     of the UNIX version, it is much easier to use.  FFIND will
	     locate files on any drive and will accept wild cards.  It
	     will also locate hidden and system files and has options
	     to remove unwanted files.

    LS -     A powerful directory listing utility which will sort 
             directories while listing and display them in either
             a short five column format or a long format with complete
             file information.  LS can also be used to display hidden
	     and system files.

    MV -     A fast powerful file mover, MV is used to relocate files
             without performing a COPY and a DEL command.  MV can be used to 
             move files to any directory or to any drive.  

    MVDIR -  The UNIX directory move utility.  MVDIR will relocate a
             directory, including all subdirectories, to any drive
	     or to any directory which is not a subdirectory of the
	     source directory.
	
    RM -     More powerful than the DOS DEL command, this utility will
	     will remove complete directory structures and is great
	     for erasing flopppies.  Unlike some UNIX versions, RM
	     will warn you before doing anything drastic.
 	 

	DOSNIX also includes versions of the CAT, TEE and TOUCH commands.
 







	DOSNIX OPTIONS:

		Most DOSNIX commands have a simple format which can
		be enhanced by the use of UNIX style option strings.
		The option string is always the first argument after
		the command and always begins with a '-'.  See the
		Command Summary for the options available with each
		command.



	INSTANT HELP:

		A brief summary of each command can be obtained on line
		by executing the command followed by a '-?'.  If a command
		normally requires arguments, executing the command without
		arguments will also display help information.


	INSTALLING DOSNIX:

		DOSNIX is intended primarily for hard drives although
		individual DOSNIX utilities can be copied to a floppy
		disk.  To install DOSNIX on your hard drive you can copy
		the files to any convenient directory, such as C:\DOSNIX
		and add the directory to the PATH statement in your
		AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  If you don't have an AUTOEXEC.BAT
		file you can make one with the following two lines:

			PATH = C:;C:\DOSNIX
			PROMPT $P$G

		This will get you up and running with DOSNIX.

		

	USING DOSNIX:

		DOSNIX is based on UNIX although the author has deviated
		from UNIX standards whenever he thought that the useability
		of the system would be enhanced.  If you are familiar with 
		UNIX you should have no problem with DOSNIX. If you are not 
		familiar with UNIX, books on the subject are available in most 
		book stores.

			SUMMARY OF DOSNIX COMMANDS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



	NAME:

		APP	Append standard input to file.


	SYNTAX:

		app  file1 [file2..file5]		Appends standard input
							to up to five files.



	DESCRIPTION:

		APP is a non-UNIX command meant to replace the DOS '>>'
		operator.  Using '>>' to append files will not remove the
		'End of File' marker from the first file.  APP can be
		used with the dos '|' operator and any command which
		writes to standard output.  For example:

		cat file1 file2 | app file3

		Appends output of CAT to file3.  See CAT.

		app < file1 file2

		appends file1 to file2. WARNING:  Do not use
		 'app < file1 > file2'.  This will erase file2.

		APP is meant for use with text files only and use with
		binary files is not recommended.





	NAME:

		CAT	Copy text file(s) to standard output.


	SYNTAX:


		cat				Copies standard input to
						standard output.

		cat file1			Copies file1 to standard
						output. Usually the screen.

		cat file1 file2 > file3 	Concatenates file1 and file2
						and stores in file3.




	DESCRIPTION:

		CAT reads one or more files and copies them to the standard
		output.  If no input file is given, CAT will read the standard
		input until a '^Z' is found.  For example:

			cat *.c > source

		will concatenate all files with an extension of '.c' and store
		them in 'source'.

			cat file1 file2 | app file3

		concatenates file1 and file2 and appends the result to file3.

			cat > temp

		stores whatever is typed on the keyboard in 'temp' and is
		similar to the DOS command 'copy con temp'.  'ctl z' can be
		used to terminate this operation.

		CAT is meant for use with text files only and use with binary
		files is not recommended.






	NAME:

		CHMOD	Change attribute(s) of file.


	SYNTAX:

		chmod [+x] file1		Adds attribute x to file1

		chmod [-x] file1		Removes attribute x from file1



	ATTRIBUTES:

		+a				Set archive bit.
		-a				Clear archive bit.
		+h				Add hidden attribute.
		-h				Remove hidden attribute.
		+r				Add read only attribute.
		-r				Remove read only attribute.
		+s				Add system attribute.
		-s				Remove system attribute.



	DESCRIPTION:

		CHMOD is used to modify the attributes of a file.
		Attributes can be grouped together in any sequence
		but each attribute must be preceeded by a '+' or a
		'-'.  For example:

			chmod -a *.*

		removes the archive bit from all files in the current
		directory,

			chmod -a+r list.txt

		removes the archive bit and makes 'list.txt' read only,

			chmod +h+s widget.com

		makes 'widget.com' a hidden, system file.







	NAME:

		CP	Copy file to new file or directory.



	SYNTAX:

		cp [-abcfinopst] file1 file2	Copies file1 to file2


		cp [-abcfinopst] file1 [file2..filen] dir

						Copies any number of files
						to directory.

		cp [-abcfinopst] dir1 dir2	Copies files in dir1 to dir2.

		cp -m[abcfinospt] source dest1 [dest2..destn]

						Makes multiple copies of source
						dest  may  be  either file or
						directory.


	OPTIONS:

		a		Copy hidden and system files.  Prompt
				before overwriting protected files.
		b		Copy only files with archive bit set.
		c		Clear archive bits after copying.
		f		Copy hidden and system files.  Overwrite
				protected files without prompting.
		i		Interactive mode. Prompts before copying.
		m		Make multiple copies of single file.
		n		No delete. Do not overwrite existing files.
		o		Overwrite existing files without prompting.
				Does not overwrite protected files.
		p		Preserve file attributes when copying.
		s		Copy files without echoing to screen.
		t		Update file time and date when copying.



	DESCRIPTION:

		CP copies one or more files to a new file or directory.
		If more than one source file is specified or wildcards
		are used, the last  argument  must  specify  an existing
		directory or an error  will  occur.  If a  directory  is
		is used as a source, all files in the directory will be
		copied but subdirectories will not be copied.

		Each file is echoed to the screen as it is copied and exist-
		ing  files  are not overwritten  without prompting.  If an
		existing file is   protected the user will be notified and
		prompted a second time before the file is overwritten. Options
		are provided to override these features when desired.

		The '-i' option will prompt the user for a yes or no answer
		before copying each file.  Used with wildcards or directory
		names this option provides an interactive method of copying
		files.

		Hidden and system files can be copied using the '-a' option
		or the '-f' option.  If the '-f' option is used all existing
		files, even protected files, will be overwritten without
		prompting the user.

		The '-o' option can be used overwrite existing files but
		will not overwrite protected files.  If the '-n' option
		is used, no files will be overwritten and the user will not
		be prompted.  The '-n' option overrides all other options
		in this respect.

		If the '-s' option is used, files will not be echoed to the
		screen when copying.  This option can be used with the '-o',
		'-f' or '-n' options when no screen output is desired.

		Unlike the MV command, file attributes are not carried over
		and the archive bit of the new file is set. The '-p' option
		can be used to preserve the attributes of the old file.

		In normal use CP will carry over the time and date of the old
		file.  If the '-t' option is used, the new file will be stamped
		with the current DOS time and date.

		CP can be used for backups with the '-b' option.  When this
		option is used, only  archive files are copied.  The '-c'
		option will clear the archive bit on both files after the
		copy is made.

		Sometimes it is  necessary to  copy a  file to	several
		different drives or directories.  CP can be used with the
		'-m' option to make as many copies of a file as needed.






	NAME:

		FFIND	Find all copies of file in specified path.


	SYNTAX:

		ffind [-adilmr?] [path] filename  Finds all files in path
						with same name.


	OPTIONS:

		a		Include hidden and system files in search.
		d		Include directories in search.
		i		Remove files interactively.
		l		Display in long format, showing
				attributes, size, time and date.
		m		Display totals for each directory.
		r		Remove files when found.
		?		Display help screen.



	DESCRIPTION:

		FFIND will search the specified path for all copies of a given
		file.  'path' should be a valid directory name.  If 'path' is
		omitted the search will begin from the root directory of the
		current drive. Wild cards can be used in file names and all
		subdirectories will be searched. For example:

			ffind temp
		or
			ffind \ temp

		will search the entire current drive for all files named temp,

			ffind d:\ temp

		will search all of drive d for all files named temp, and

			ffind \games poker.exe

		will search the directory '\games' and all subdirectories for
		all files named 'poker.exe'.

		The '-r' option will delete files when found.  For example:

			ffind -r c:\ *.bak

		will search drive c for all files with an extension of '.bak'
		and remove them.  The '-i' option is similar to the '-r'
		option except that the user is prompted before each file is
		removed.

		FFIND will locate hidden and system files with the '-a'
		option	but the '-r' option cannot be used to remove protected
		files.	Use the '-i' option to remove these files.

		The '-l' option can be used to display complete information
		on each file located.

		The '-m' option wiil display the total number of matching
		files in each directory along with the total number of bytes
		used.  For example:

			ffind -alm c:\ *.* > disk.map

		will create a complete usage map of the user's hard disk and
		store it in 'disk.map'.






	NAME:

		LS	List contents of directory.


	SYNTAX:

		ls [-ablpu?] [path1]..[pathn]	Displays contents of dir.



	OPTIONS:

		1		Display one entry per line.
		a		Display hidden and system files.
		b		Do not pause when screen is full.
		f		Display files only. Omit directories.
		l		Display files in long format, showing
				name, attributes, size, time and date.
		p		Put a backslash after each subdirectory.
		u		Do not sort files.
		?		Display help screen.


	DESCRIPTION:

		  LS displays the contents of a directory sorted across
		the screen in five columns.  The arguments can be either
		files or directories. If wildcards are used, all matching
		files will be listed.  If no argument is used, the current
		directory is displayed.  If no options are used a backslash
		will be appended to each subdirectory name and the total
		number of files displayed at the bottom of the listing.

		The '-x' option is the same as the default mode execpt that
		no backslash is appended to subdirectories and no file totals
		are displayed.

		The '-c' option will display the directory sorted down each
		column rather than across each row.

		The '-f' option will display files only and omit any sub-
		directories.

		If the '-l' option is used, one entry per line is displayed,
		showing name, attributes, size of file in bytes, and time and
		date of last modification.  A modified DOS format is used
		which is more readable than the standard UNIX format.
		Attributes displayed in this format are:

			<DIR>		Subdirectory.
			A		Archive bit is set.
			R		File is read only.
			H		File is hidden.
			S		File is system.

		At the	end of each display the size of the directory in bytes
		is shown. The size of any subdirectories is not included in
		this figure.  Also shown is the remaining space left.

		If the	'-1' (one) option is used, one entry per line is dis-
		played showing	only the name.

		In the previous two formats LS will pause after displaying one
		page of information. Typing 'q' at this point will terminate
		the program. Typing any other key will	continue the display.
		The '-b' option will suppress this feature  and  provide  a
		continuous output which can be	redirected.


		If the '-a' option is used, any hidden or system files
		contained in the directory are also displayed. If the '-l'
		option is not used, the '-p' option will append a backslash
		to the end of each subdirectory name, allowing the user to
		distinguish between files and  subdirectories.	The '-u'
		option will provide unsorted output if so desired.

		This version of LS will not recursively list subdirectories
		but the FFIND command can be used to achieve the same result.
		
		




	NAME:

		MV	Move file(s) to new file or directory.


	SYNTAX:

		mv [-afnost?] file1 file2	Moves (renames) file1 to file2.

		mv [-afnost?] file1 [file2..filen] dir
						Moves any number of files
						to new directory.

		mv dir1 dir2			Renames dir1 to dir2. dir1
						and dir2 must be in same
						parent directory.


	OPTIONS:

		a		Move read only, hidden and system files.
				Prompt before overwriting protected files.
		f		Move and overwrite all files without prompting.
		i		Interactive mode. Prompt before moving.
		n		No delete. Do not overwrite existing files.
		o		Overwrite existing files without prompting.
		s		Move files without echoing to screen.
		t		Update file time and date when moving.
		?		Display help screen.


	DESCRIPTION:

		MV moves one or more files to a new file or directory.
		If more than one source file is specified or wildcards
		are used, the last  argument  must  specify  an existing
		directory or an error  will  occur.  If a  directory  is
		is used as a source, all files in the directory will be
		moved but subdirectories will not be moved.

		Each file is echoed to the screen as it is moved and exist-
		ing  files  are not overwritten  without prompting.  If an
		existing file is   protected the user will be notified and
		prompted a second time before the file is overwritten. Options
		are provided to override these features when desired.

		The '-i' option will prompt the user for a yes or no answer
		before moving each file.  Used with wildcards or directory
		names this option provides an interactive method of moving
		files.

		In normal use MV, ignores hidden and system files and prompts
		the user before moving read only files. Hidden and system
		files can be moved using the '-a' option or the '-f' option.
		The '-a' option will move read only, hidden and system files
		without prompting but will still prompt the user before over-
		writing protected files. If the '-f' option is used all
		existing files, even protected files, will be overwritten
		without prompting the user.

		The '-o' option can be used overwrite existing files but
		will not overwrite protected files.  If the '-n' option
		is used, no files will be overwritten and the user will not
		be prompted.  The '-n' option overrides all other options
		in this respect.

		If the '-s' option is used, filenames will not be echoed to
		the screen when moving.  This option can be used with the '-o',
		'-f' or '-n' options when no screen output is desired.

		In normal use MV will carry over the time and date of the old
		file.  If the '-t' option is used, the new file will be stamped
		with the current DOS time and date. Unlike the CP command, MV
		will also carry over the attributes of the old file.







	NAME:

		MVDIR	Move directory and all subdirectories to new location.


	SYNTAX:

		mv dir1 dir2			Moves dir1 to dir2



	OPTIONS:

		s		Move files without echoing to screen.
		?		Display help screen.



	DESCRIPTION:

		MVDIR will move a directory and all its subdirectories
		to the specified target. If the target directory does
		not exist a new directory will be created. If the target
		directory does exist a directory will be created within
		the target directory having the same name as the old
		directory.

		MVDIR has three modes of operation totally independent
		of user input.	If both old and new directories are in
		the same parent directory, MVDIR will rename the old
		directory. If old and new directories are not in the same
		parent directory but reside on the same drive, MVDIR will
		create the new directory structure, rename the files and
		then remove the old directory. If old and new directories
		reside on different drives MVDIR will create the new
		directory structure, copy the files over and then remove
		the old files and directory.  If an error occurs in this
		last mode, such as a disk full error, MVDIR will abort and
		leave the old directory intact.








	NAME:

		PG	Display text in page format.


	SYNTAX:

		pg				Displays standard input
						one page at a time.

		pg file1 file2 .. filen 	Displays contents of files
						one page at a time.


	DESCRIPTION:

		PG can be used to display text files or standard input.
		PG will display one page of text and then pause.  Pressing
		the space bar will display the next page of text.  Typing
		'^D' will display the next half page of text.  Hitting 'Enter'
		will display the next line of text.  Typing the digit d
		will display d lines of text.  Typing 'q' will term-
		nate the program and return to DOS.

		Output from other programs can be piped to pg using the '|'
		operator.  For example:

			ffind c:\ *.* | pg

		will allow the user to page through the output of FFIND
		which in this case is a complete list of files on drive C.







	NAME:

		RM	Remove file(s).


	SYNTAX:

		rm [-fis] file1 		Removes file1.

		rm -r[fis] dir1 		Completely removes dir1.



	OPTIONS:

		f		Remove protected files without prompting.
		i		Remove files interactively.
		r		Recursively remove subdirectories.
		s		Remove files without echoing to screen.




	DESCRIPTION:

		RM is the UNIX equivalent of the dos 'del' command.  If a
		protected file is specified, RM will prompt the user before
		removing unless the '-f' option is used.  Ordinarily each
		file is echoed to the screen as it is removed.	The '-s'
		option is used to override this feature.  The '-i' option
		can be used with wildcards to allow the user to pick and
		choose which files will be removed.

		The '-r' option is used to remove directories.	A directory
		cannot be removed unless this option is used.  The directory
		along with all files and subdirectories will be completely
		removed.

		WARNING:

			rm -r \

		will completely erase the current drive.  Use the '-r'
		option with care.






	NAME:

		TEE	Copy standard input to standard output and file(s).


	SYNTAX:

		tee [-a] file1 [file2]..[file5]
						Copies standard input to
						standard output and files.


	OPTIONS:

		a			Append output to specified file[s]
		s			Suppress standard output.


	DESCRIPTION:

		TEE can be used with the DOS '|' operator and any command
		which writes to standard output.  For example:

			cat file1 file2 | tee file3

		concatenates file1 and file2 while displaying them on the
		screen and stores them in file3.

			ls -lc dir1 | tee file1

		displays dir1 in long format and stores the output in file1.

		The '-a' option can be used to append the output to existing
		files.	If the '-a' option is not used, existing files will
		be overwritten.  For exeample:

			tee -a file2 <file1

		displays file1 and appends it to the end of file2

			tee file2 <file1

		displays file1 and overwrites file2.

		The '-s' option can be used to suppress standard output
		and write to specified files only.  For example:

			cat source1 | tee -s file1 file2 file3

		will make multiple copies of source1 without displaying
		it on the screen.

		TEE is meant for use with text files only and use with
		binary files is not recommended.





	NAME:

		TOLOWER 	Convert to lower case.



	SYNTAX:

		tolower 			Converts standard input to
						lower case and writes to
						standard output.



	DESCRIPTION:

		TOLOWER is a filter which will convert all upper case
		characters to lower case.  All other characters are left
		unchanged.  For exeample:

			tolower < file1 > file2

		converts file1 to lower case and stores the result in file2.







	NAME:

		TOUCH	Modify file date and time.



	SYNTAX:

		touch [-t] [mm/dd/yy;hh:mm:ss] file1
						Changes date and time of file1



	OPTIONS:

		t			User selected time and date.



	DESCRIPTION:

		TOUCH will change the date and time of the specified file
		to the current DOS date and time.  If the '-t' option is
		used the user can supply the date and time as the next
		argument in the format mm/dd/yy;hh:mm:ss.  If the date and
		time argument is omitted the user is prompted to enter the
		date and time of his choice.  Wildcards can be used in file
		names.






	NAME:

		TOUPPER 	Convert to upper case.



	SYNTAX:

		toupper 			Converts standard input to
						upper case and writes to
						standard output.



	DESCRIPTION:

		TOUPPER is a filter which will convert all lower case
		characters to upper case.  All other characters are left
		unchanged.  For exeample:

			toupper < file1 > file2

		converts file1 to upper case and stores the result in file2.








	  DOSNIX ver. 0.92 is completly uncrippled and registration is
	requested but not required.  Copies can be made and distributed
