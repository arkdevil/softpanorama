This is inacurate and I will correct that. The Japanese genious Okumara
(I really admire that man) invented LZHUF and AR002, from these two
LHarc and LHA were derived. Okumara has never been a speeed freak
(Yoshi takes care of that part) but he certainly has had some smart
idea's. The technology in AR002 (which is quite readable BTW) is also
used in ARJ, ZOO, PKZIP 1.93a and ZIP 1.9 and probably also in Squeeze
etc. All those programs (except ZOO) have improved LZSS engines and
faster code but the concept hasn't really changed. 

One could interpret my writing as if the SOURCES were derived from AR002
and this for ARJ only partially and for ZIP completely not the case.
