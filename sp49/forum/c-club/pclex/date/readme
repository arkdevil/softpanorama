
ABRAXAS SOFTWARE, DATE program example.

This is a more advanced example and we assume the most important one.

please see the makefile for how to build this program.


If you run PCLEX make sure the include and skeleton files are in the working
directory.


This program shows how PCYACC and PCLEX are connected, of special
concern is the communication via yylval(YYSTYPE), yytext, yyleng, and
yylex(). Please examine this example thoroughly if you are new to
this concept.



What this program does (MDATE),

after you type "MDATE", you can type, "Nov 7, 1988" or "11/7/1988" or
 "7 Nov 1988", and the program will return the day of week, for any date.


example, "Nov 7, 1988" ( without quotes )

returns, "Monday"


This is a simple example but it gets the point across, good luck.
