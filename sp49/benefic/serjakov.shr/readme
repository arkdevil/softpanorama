3.  NOTES AND RESTRICTIONS
--------------------------
o Version 1.0 of Turbo Vision Source Code Generator has been designed to 
  support the Turbo Pascal's Turbo Vision version 6.0. Earlier versions of 
  Turbo Pascal, are not supported.
o You need to set the files directive in your CONFIG.SYS file to
  at least FILES = 10, preferably FILES = 20. If you have trouble
  doing the File|DOS Shell command make sure the FILES directive 
  is in your CONFIG.SYS.
o In the Edit window you can load file not longer then 65519 bytes.
o If you recieved messages 'Out of memory' or 'Not enough memory to
  complete operation' you have to unload any TSR programs because you 
  haven't enough memory.TVGEN needs enough memory for normal work.
o StatusLine objects don't be visible in the Resource|Get\View command.
  To look it in the action you have to generate source code and execute
  program.
o Don't forget that all yours symbol determinations must be defined into 
  source code and you are responsible for right compilation of the 
  generated source.
o In this version you won't save everything you create because this
  is SHAREWARE product and lack of several functions may be discovered.
o But you can save generated source by File|Write block command.This is
  only way you can work with program and anything build.But you can't
  keep built objects and update it and this is sufficient reason to
  register and obtain full version of TVGEN. 
o Since this is a SHAREWARE program, contribution in 150 rubles or any
  equivalents in the currency would be appreciated.The flopy disk with
  full version of TVGEN will be sent to you at shortest term.
  New version of TVGEN will be given registered users with good discount.
  For more information about registration see file REGISTER.ME.
  Also this users will be given for such services:
    - help in learning Turbo Pascal 6.0 and Turbo Vision
    - help in learning object-oriented programming
    - help in learning event-driven programming (that have been used in
        programming Turbo Pascal 6.0,Turbo C++,Borland C++,Windows 3.0 and
        etc.) ant that is used in Turbo Vision.
o Because printed manual haven't been created you can get additional 
  information by pressing F1|Help command in the TVGEN IDE.
  If you are experienced in Turbo Vision this information will be sufficient
  for you.
o If you find any bugs in the TVGEN we would be appreciate 
  if you  apply to us with exact indication of this error.
