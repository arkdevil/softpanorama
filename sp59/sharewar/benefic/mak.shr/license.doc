Disclaimer of Warranty

This software and the accompanying files are sold "as is" and without
warranties as to performance of merchantability or any other warranties
whether expressed or implied.  In particular, there is no warranty for
the optional virus scanning feature (WinZip does not scan for viruses,
it simply runs external programs that claim to perform this function).
Because of the various hardware and software environments into which
WinZip may be put, no warranty of fitness for a particular purpose is
offered.

Good data processing procedure dictates that any program be thoroughly
tested with non-critical data before relying on it.  The user must
assume the entire risk of using the program.  Any liability of the
seller will be limited exclusively to product replacement or refund of
