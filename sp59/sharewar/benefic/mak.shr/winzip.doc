* Overview

WinZip brings the convenience of Windows to the use of ZIP, LZH, and ARC
files.  It features an intuitive point and click SAA/CUA compliant
interface for viewing, running, extracting, adding, deleting, and
testing files in archives.  Optional virus scanning support is included.

Here's what the magazine reviews say about WinZip:

  "Repeatedly charms you when you have to ZIP and unZIP ...
     an excellent Shareware utility" Windows Magazine, 12/92
  "Our copy gets quite a daily workout" Windows User 11/92
  "The most comprehensive Windows front-end to PKZIP" Ziffnet Threads, 11/92
  "Does all your compression chores with ease" Computer Shopper, 10/92
  "Greatly facilitates archive Management" Windows Magazine, 9/92
  "Must-Have Shareware Treasure" Compute, 10/92
  "The perfect Windows interface for LHA, PKZIP, ARC, and your
      favorite DOS virus scanner" PC World, 10/92
  "Powerful yet Intuitive" PC World, 8/92
  "Hot Product" Inside Microsoft Windows, 8/92
  "WinApp of the Month" PC Computing, 3/92

WinZip is extremely easy to use!  To open an archive simply double click
on an archive listed in the File Manager, drag and drop an archive onto
WinZip, or use the standard Open dialog.  The main WinZip window
features a list box with the names, sizes, and date/time stamps of all
files in the open archive.  This list can be scrolled and sorted on any
field.  A tool bar provides fast access to commonly used actions.  All
options (including window size and position) can be saved and restored.
Extensive context sensitive help is always available.

Double clicking on a file in the main window has the same effect as
double clicking in the File Manager.  First the file is extracted from
the archive.  If the file is executable, it is run.  Otherwise, the file
is opened by the appropriate application (for example, Windows Write for
*.WRI files) based on standard Windows associations.

The Windows 3.1 Drag and Drop Interface is fully supported.  You can
drag and drop files from WinZip to other applications.  WinZip will
extract the files before dropping them on the target application.  The
target application will treat the files as if they had been dropped by
the File Manager.  You can also drop archives on WinZip to open them, or
drop files on WinZip to add them to the open archive.

WinZip's unique CheckOut Facility makes it easy to quickly examine files
in archive.  Click on the CheckOut button to extract all files in an
archive to a temporary directory and create a Program Manager group for
all files in the archive.  This group will contain one icon for each
file.  Double click on an icon to view the corresponding file with the
appropriate application.  When WinZip is closed, it will optionally
delete the temporary files and group.

WinZip 4.0 adds support for PKZIP 2.0, the ARJ file format, 3-D dialog
boxes, and the color toolbar.  New features introduced in WinZip 3.2
include Built-in ZIP Extraction and font selection for the list of files
in the open archive.  If you modify a file after double clicking on it,
WinZip will now offer to update the archive with the modified file.  See
the section titled Version History for a complete list of enhancements.

WinZip requires Windows 3.0 or 3.1 in Enhanced or Standard mode and the
Shareware PKZIP and PKUNZIP product from PKWARE, Inc. or LHA.EXE from
Haruyasu Yoshizaki.  WinZip interfaces to several programs to access ARC
files and optionally runs most virus scanning utilities.  For details
see the section titled System Requirements.  WinZip runs these programs
in the background in Windows Enhanced (80386) mode, or as full-screen
applications in Standard mode.  For more information on this aspect of
the program, see the section titled Enhanced and Standard modes.

WinZip is distributed as Shareware.  This means that users are
encouraged, subject to restrictions described in the License Agreement,
to share copies of this program with friends, associates and bulletin
boards.  Please remember that if you use this software you are required
to pay the registration fee of $29 as described in the section titled
Copyright/License Agreement/Warranty.

This program is produced by a member of the Association of Shareware
Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure that the shareware
principle works for you.  If you are unable to resolve a
shareware-related problem with an ASP member by contacting the member
directly, ASP may be able to help.  The ASP Ombudsman can help you
resolve a dispute or problem with an ASP member, but does not provide
technical support for members' products.  Please write to the ASP

* About ZIP, LZH, and ARC files

Archives are files that contain other files.  Typically the files in an
archive are compressed.  Archives usually have file names ending with ZIP,
LZH, ARJ, or ARC, depending on how they were created.  Archives make it
easy to group files and make transporting and copying these files faster.

ZIP files are the most common archive format.  ZIP files are manipulated by
the PKZIP and PKUNZIP programs from PKWARE, Inc.  ZIP files were the only
archive format supported in the first version of WinZip.

LZH files are manipulated by the LHA program from Haruyasu Yoshizaki.  LHA
won the October 1991 PC Magazine Editor's Choice award as the best data
compression utility.  WinZip version 3.0 added support for the LZH file
format, including self-extracting LZH files.

ARJ files are another popular archive format.  ARJ files are manipulated by
the ARJ program from Robert Jung, 2606 Village Road West, Norwood,
Massachusetts 02062.  WinZip version 4.0 added support for the ARJ file
format, including self-extracting ARJ files.

The ARC format, developed by System Enhancement Associates, was the first
popular PC file format to support multiple compressed files.  The ARC
program was originally distributed as a Shareware program, and the ARC
format was the standard file format on most bulletin boards and other
online systems.  However, after PKZIP and PKUNZIP were released, the ZIP
format became the new standard for many of these systems.  Note:  the
latest release of ARC (version 7) is only sold as a commercial
(non-Shareware) program.

Since there are still many old ARC files on bulletin boards, WinZip version
2.0 added support for this format.  Since most new files seem to be created
in ZIP or LZH format, and there is no single widely available program to
manipulate ARC files, WinZip does not provide facilities to update ARC
files (all other WinZip functions are supported).

The latest Shareware version of ARC (version 6) provides limited support
for subdirectories.  However, because individual files cannot be extracted
from ARC files containing subdirectories and the "extract to" directory
cannot be specified, WinZip will not open ARC files containing
subdirectories.  I expect this limitation will have negligible effect,
since I have yet to encounter an ARC file containing subdirectories on any
BBS.  Let me know if this causes a problem for you.

WinZip supports several programs to extract files from ARC files:  the
original ARC, ARCE (also known as ARC-E), PKXARC, and PKUNPAK.  See the
section titled Installation for more information on these programs.

* Brief Tutorial

This section provides a brief tutorial on basic WinZip operations.  It
assumes the following:

- Your system meets the requirements described in the section titled System
  Requirements and you have installed WinZip as described in the section
  titled Installation.
- You know how to use standard Windows features, such as dialog boxes,
  menus, and the drag and drop interface.  If you are not are familiar with
  these features, please consult your Windows documentation.
- You are familiar with the concept of archives.  For a description of
  archives, see the section titled About ZIP, LZH, ARJ, and ARC files.

Remember that context sensitive help is always available.  Press the F1 key
at any time to access the full documentation.

Working with Existing Archives:

The first step is to open an archive.  There are several ways to open
archives:

a) Double click on the archive in the File Manager.
b) Drag the archive from the File Manager and drop it on the WinZip window.
c) Select Open from the WinZip File pull-down menu, or push the Open button
   on the toolbar, and select an archive from the standard Open dialog box.

Once an archive is open, you can select from the operations in the Actions
pull-menu.  For example, to extract files, select Extract from the Actions
pull-down menu or push the Extract button on the toolbar.  This activates
the Extract dialog box.  For complete documentation on these actions, click
on the appropriate entry in the Commands and Procedures section in the
Table of Contents.

The CheckOut action is particularly useful when working with an archive
you've downloaded from a bulletin board.  Click on the CheckOut button to
extract all files in an archive to a temporary directory and create a
Program Manager group for all files in the archive.  This group will
contain one icon for each file.  Double click on an icon to view the
corresponding file with the appropriate application.  When WinZip is
closed, it will optionally delete the temporary files and group.

Creating Archives:

To create a new archive, select New from the WinZip File pull-down menu or
push the New button on the toolbar.  This activates the New dialog box.
Enter the name of the archive you want to create.  You can use the Drives
and Directories list boxes to choose the drive and directory where the
archive will be created.  The names of any existing archives on the
selected drive and directory will be listed to help you choose a name that
is not already in use.  Press the OK button to complete your selection.

Normally the Add dialog box will be activated automatically.  Simply type
the name(s) of the files you want to add to the new archive and press the
Add button.  Alternately, you can add files to an archive by dragging the
files from the File Manager and dropping them on the WinZip window.

This concludes the brief tutorial.  For complete documentation, please see
other portions of this help file.  If you have questions, feel free to
contact the author at the address listed in the About dialog box.

* Support and questions

Technical support is available at no charge by sending electronic mail
to 70056,241 on CompuServe, to Nico_Mak on BIX, or by sending US Mail to

priority but I will try to answer all questions.

When reporting problems with WinZip, please include the following
information:

1) Is the problem recreatable?  If so, how?

2) Did the problem occur when running Windows in Enhanced, Standard, or
Real mode?  You can determine which mode is active by choosing About in
the Program Manager's Help pull-down menu.

3) If a dialog box with an error message was displayed, please include
the text of the message.

Thank you!

Note:  You can press F1 at any time while WinZip is active for context
sensitive help.

* Installation and System Requirements

System Requirements:

- Windows 3.0 or Windows 3.1.  WinZip will not run under the initial
release of OS/2 2.0 due to incompatibilities in OS/2's emulation of
Windows.

- One or more of the following three sets of programs:

1) PKZIP(TM) and PKUNZIP(TM) from PKWARE, Inc.  You can download the
Shareware version of these programs from most bulletin boards.  The latest
version is distributed in the self-extracting ZIP file PKZ110.EXE.
Alternately, you can order them directly from PKWARE (phone 414-345-8699).
WinZip has been tested with PKZIP/PKUNZIP 1.1 and 2.0 will not work with
earlier versions.

2) LHA.EXE, from Haruyasu Yoshizaki.  You can download LHA.EXE from most
bulletin boards.  The latest version is distributed in the self-extracting
LZH file LHA213.EXE.  WinZip has been tested with LHA 2.13 and will not
work with earlier versions (in particular, it will not function with LHARC,
the predecessor to LHA).

3) ARJ, from Robert Jung.  You can download the Shareware version of ARJ
from most bulletin boards.  The latest version is distributed in the
self-extracting ARJ file ARJ230.EXE.  WinZip has been tested with ARJ 2.3
and will not work with earlier versions.

To (optionally) access ARC files one of the following programs is required:

- ARCE.COM and ARC-E.COM version 4.0e - Vern Berg's ARC extraction utility,
available on CompuServe and other bulletin boards.  WinZip was not tested
with earlier versions.

- PKXARC.COM version 3.5 from PKWARE, Inc.  WinZip was not tested with
earlier versions.  This program is still available on some bulletin boards.

- PKXARC.EXE version 3.6 from PKWARE, Inc.  This program is still available
on some bulletin boards.

- PKUNPAK.EXE version 3.61 from PKWARE, Inc.  This program is still available
on some bulletin boards.

= ARC.EXE version 5.20 or 6.0 from System Enhancement Associates, Inc.  This
is the last version of ARC available as Shareware, and is still available
on some bulletin boards.  WinZip was not tested with earlier versions.
SEA's address is 925 Clifton Ave., Clifton, NJ 07013.

You can run most virus scanning utilities from WinZip.  For important
details, see the section titled Virus Scanner Configuration.  Direct
support is provided for the McAfee Associates SCAN.EXE virus scanner.  SCAN
is available from CompuServe, BIX, and other bulletin boards.  McAfee
Associates address is 4423 Cheeney Street, Santa Clara, CA 95054.

Note:  Like WinZip, the PKZIP, PKUNZIP, ZIP2EXE, ARJ, ARC, PKXARC, and SCAN
programs are not free software.  As with all Shareware, if you use these
programs you should register them with the appropriate vendor.

Installation:

Installation with the SETUP program:

If you received WinZip on a disk with the file SETUP.EXE, you can install
WinZip in one of two ways:

1) Exit Windows, insert the WinZip distribution disk in your floppy drive,
type win a:\setup at the DOS prompt, and press Enter.

2) From the Windows Program Manager, choose Run from the File menu, type
a:\setup, and press Enter.

Installation without the SETUP program:

WinZip is distributed on BBS systems without a SETUP program for faster
downloads.  If you received WinZip without the file SETUP.EXE, or wish to
perform a manual installation, follow this easy one time installation
procedure:

1) If you already have installed a previous version of WinZip, backup and
delete all files in your WinZip directory.  Otherwise create a directory to
hold the WinZip related files.  For example, "C:\WINZIP".

2) Copy all WinZip-related files to this directory.  At a minimum you need
the following files:  WINZIP.EXE, WZ.DLL, WZ.COM, WZ.PIF, and WINZIP.HLP.

3) Run WINZIP.EXE.  If Windows is not loaded, issue the WIN command, and
specify the full path name to WINZIP.EXE.  For example, if you copied the
WinZip related files into a directory named C:\WINZIP, issue the following
command from the DOS prompt:

        WIN C:\WINZIP\WINZIP.EXE

Alternately, if you are already running Windows, simply double click on the
WINZIP.EXE entry in the File Manager.  If you are not familiar with the
File Manager, you can instead follow these four steps to run WinZip for the
first time:

a) Activate the Program Manager.

b) Choose Run... from the File menu.  The Run dialog box appears.

c) Type the full filename of WINZIP.EXE in the Command Line text box.  For
example, C:\WINZIP\WINZIP.EXE

d) Choose OK.

That's all there is installing WinZip.  When WinZip is activated for the
first time, the Welcome and Configuration dialog boxes are automatically
displayed, and you are ready to go.  Remember that while WinZip is active,
online help is always available by pressing F1.

Notes:

1) The first time WinZip is run, it will offer to add a WinZip icon to your
Program Manager Accessories Group.  Choose Yes in response to this question
unless you want to add the icon yourself (the Accessories Group is merely a
default location for the icon - you can drag it to any other group like any
other Program Manager icon).  Once this is done, you can start WinZip by
double clicking on the WinZip icon in Program Manager.  Alternately, you
can open an existing archive from the File Manager by double clicking on
the file.

2) WIN.INI associations for files with an extension of "ZIP", "LZH", "ARJ",
and "ARC" are set up by the automatic installation procedure so that you
can start WinZip by double clicking on the icons for these files while
running the File Manager.  To make it possible to view .HLP files by double
clicking on them, an association for these files is set up if none exists.
For more information on associations, see the section titled Windows
Associations.
