* RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY MAP
	Welcome to Random  access memory map!  This environment	 gives you the
direct access to any portion of  the 1-Mb address space of your  computer. You
can search memory for ASCII or hex strings, edit memory in ASCII or hex  mode,
paste portions  of memory  into Multi-Edit  windows or  write them  to disk in
binary mode. You can also get information on various DOS memory structures, as
memory control blocks, TSRs, device drivers, DOS drive parameter blocks.
	The first time you invoke RAM map row 2 of the screen looks  typically
like this:

^B░0000:0000░░░░Chain░to░░38E7:00CE░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░Absolute░00000░░░░^b

	The segment:offset indicator to the left is the address where the  RAM
display starts. The "Chain to" indicator  gives the value of DWORD pointer  at
segment:offset; you can actually  go to the location  it points to if  you hit
<F8>  --  Chain  key.  Currently  it  points  to  the INT 0 -- divide error --
handler.  This  interrupt  is  intercepted  by  Multi-Edit,  so  you will find
yourself somewhere inside the Multi-Edit  code. Press <CtrlHome> to return  to
0000:0000.
	You  cannot  fail  to  notice  that  two bytes at locations 0:0440 and
0:046C are rapidly changing their values.  The former is time until motor  off
and the latter is  the least significant byte  of counter of 55ms  ticks since
CPU reset; it actually occupies four bytes (0:046C - 0:0470).

			       ^BNavigation Keys^b

	^B<UP>,<DN>,<PGUP>,<PGDN>^b -- Browse through the memory within  currently
set segment.
	^B<HOME>^b -- Go to segment:0000.
	^B0-9A-F^b -- Set hex address to start memory display. The arrow (^B^b) on
row 1 shows where you are; use ^B<LF>^b and ^B<RT>^b to move the arrow.
	^B<GREY+>, <GREY->^b -- Increase/decrease the starting offset.
	^B<Ctrl> or  <Ms>^b --  Move the  current character  indicator
around the screen. The hex value  of that character is displayed on  the lower
status bar.
	^B<Alt>,  <AltHOME>,  <AltEND>^b  --  Move  the  lower status bar. The
display is squeezed between the upper bar,  which is always on row 2, and  the
lower bar, which  you can move  up or down,  changing the number  of displayed
rows.

				 ^BOther keys^b

        ^B<CtrlG>^ -- @AUGMENTA.HLP^*%Change_Font[ Change screen font. ]
	^B<F5>^b -- Mark current position in RAM. Use @DISP_RAM.HLP^GOTOMK[<ShftF5>] to retrieve any
of the previously marked positions.
	^B<F10> or <ESC>^b -- Quit RAM map, return to editing.
PASTE PASTE CURRENT SCREEN INTO MULTI-EDIT WINDOW
	The portion of RAM that is currently displayed is either inserted into
current window at cursor  position or you can  choose to insert it  into a new
window.
HEXINS HEX INSERT
	Type hex values  of characters you  wish to insert  at segment:offset.
Press ^B<CR>^b to confirm or ^B<ESC>^b to abort operation.
EDIT ASCII EDITING OF A STRING
	You are currently editing in  text mode the string of  memory starting
at current character and ending at the right border of the display window. See
@ME.HLP^PROMPTS[prompts].
GOTOMK GO TO MARKED POSITION IN RAM
	This @ME.HLP^VARMENU[variable length menu] allows you to go to any of the previously
marked positions in RAM. Use ^B<F5>^b to mark positions.
SEARCH ASCII SEARCH
	Input  the  search  string  and  press  ^B<CR>^b. Use ^B<CtrlF6>^b to continue
searching. Please  note that  while you  are in  the "active  zone" of memory,
where the execution is currently under way, the found string may get instantly
overwritten by  some other  stuff --  you will  probably not  have the time to
notice it.
HEXSRC HEX SEARCH
	Type hex  values of  characters you  wish to  look for.  Press ^B<CR>^b to
confirm or ^B<ESC>^b to abort operation.
INTVEC LOCATE INTERRUPT VECTOR
	The interrupt vector for interrupt  n occupies four bytes starting  at
address  4*n.  This  service  performs  this  multuplication for you. Type the
interrupt  number  (in  hex)  and  press  ^B<CR>^b.  You will find yourself at the
desired  location,  the  "Chain  to"  indicator  giving you the address of the
handler.
BINWRI WRITING A PORTION OF MEMORY TO A DISK FILE
	You can save  the specified number  of bytes from  your RAM to  a disk
file. Supply the  filename, the bytes  count in hex  or dec (you  must specify
which value is to be used), and select ^B[Write]^b to perform the operation.
LOAD LOAD FILE INTO MEMORY
	Specify the file to be loaded in free memory above Multi-Edit. To make
use of this function, Multi-Edit must have been started with /An option with n
large enough to receive the file. See @ME.HLP^CMDLINE[Command-line options].
