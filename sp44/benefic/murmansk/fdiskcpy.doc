Fdiskcpy Version 4.00

This program works by the same way that Diskcopy but
using hard disk and free memory for working space .

Differences:

1. It copies Serial Number from SOURCE diskette.
2. It terminates if Write disk Error occure.

For Help type FDISKCPY on command line.

If diskette have non-standart format (e.g. 720KB in 1.2MB drive)
you should run program 800 before Fdiskcopy.
