1.  Changes since the last issue.

    Added "COBOL 85 For Programmers" to booklist

    Liant no longer lists a Mac A/UX product.

    Added details of the Micro Focus WWW server.


2.  Where can I get this FAQ ?

    This document should be archived at many sites on the Internet,
    including rtfm.mit.edu -- the archive site for all FAQs.  It is also
    available via e-mail from the author (jfid@mfltd.co.uk).

    An HTML version of the latest FAQ is also available from the Micro
    Focus WWW server.  The URL is http://www.mfltd.co.uk/FAQ/cobol-faq.html


3.  Where can I get a COBOL compiler ?

    3.1 for DOS, Windows or OS/2 ?

        Acucobol, CA, Liant, mbp and Micro Focus all produce compilers
        for one or more of these environments.  Microsoft used to
        re-badge the Micro Focus compiler, but not any more.

    3.2 for Windows/NT ?

        Micro Focus has a COBOL 32-bit SDK available for Windows/NT.
        ACUCOBOL-85 is also available and mbp also have a product
        for this platform.

    3.3 for UNIX ?

        Acucobol, Liant, mbp and Micro Focus have products available
        across a large number of UNIX platforms.  Some OEMs re-badge
        and/or re-engineer these products for their own systems, too.

        Wang also produce a development and production environment
        for the RS/6000 running AIX and HP 9000 s800 and s700 running
        HP/UX.

    3.4 for Linux ?

        There is no COBOL system available specifically for Linux.
        However, the iBCS2 code for Linux should mean that it is
        possible to get some of the i486 COBOL packages for operating
        systems such as SCO to work.

        Ralf Draeger (draegerr@informatik.tu-muenchen.de) reports that
        it is possible to get programs compiled using Micro Focus COBOL
        on SCO UNIX to run on Linux.

    3.5 for the Macintosh ?

        Micro Focus and Acucobol produce a COBOL development
        system for the Mac running A/UX.

        Micro Focus has also announced that it will be releasing
        a product on MacOS.  There are currently no dates for release.


    3.6 for other environments ?

        Most major vendors have their own COBOL implementation, or
        have someone else's ported to their platform(s).  There are
        quite a few available for CP/M and MP/M, and one is even
        rumoured to have been available for the PERQ workstation.


4.  Is there a free COBOL compiler ?

    Just for the record, no COBOL tools are listed in the Catalog
    of compilers, interpreters, and other language tools posted to
    comp.compilers and comp.lang.misc.  This probably means that
    there are no freely available COBOL compiler sources.

    However, several books in the booklist come with a COBOL compiler.
    See section 10 for details.


    4.1 for DOS, Windows or OS/2.

        There is a freely available COBOL compiler for DOS. It can be
        found on many archive sites, named COBOL650.ZIP. You also need
        DPATH30.ZIP Have a read through Section 8 before you start.

        It is widely rumoured that the sources for this compiler are
        available from a BBS.  This no longer appears to be the case.
        Numerous attempts have completely failed to track down the
        sources.

        There is a COBOL701.ARJ archive which contains a version of
        COBOL 6.50 with a limited number of compiles. It was an attempt
        at a full integrated development environment, including an
        editor. Unfortunately, no documentation is included.

        Also, it may be possible to run the freely available CP/M
        compiler (see 4.5) under a freely available CP/M emulator.

    4.2 for Windows/NT ?

        The CP/M compiler/emulator combination should work here, too.

    4.3 for UNIX ?

        There are no well-documented examples of a freely available COBOL
        compiler for UNIX.

        COBOL 6.50 might run under a UNIX emulation of a DOS system,
        however.  (For example, VP/ix, SoftPC or dosemu under Linux.)

        The CP/M compiler (see 4.5) should run under a CP/M emulator
        for UNIX in a similar fashion.

    4.4 for the Macintosh ?

        Not that I know of.

    4.5 for other environments ?

        There is a freely available CP/M COBOL compiler/interpreter
        (NPS Micro COBOL).  This is available via anonymous FTP
        from oak.oakland.edu in /pub/cpm/cobol.  However, Stefano Priola
        (s70829@galileo.polito.it) comments :

        "I've used the CPM COBOL ... I think that this compiler is much
         too old to use or for a student to learn COBOL."


5.  What happened to ...

    5.1 Ryan McFarland ?

        Ryan McFarland have been bought by Liant Software Corp.

    5.2 Realia ?

        Realia have been bought by Computer Associates (CA).  Their
        compiler is now called CA-Realia COBOL.

7.  COBOL standards.

    7.1 What standards exist ?

        The current COBOL standard is the ISO/ANSI '85 standard.  This
        replaced the ANSI '74 standard.

        There are two amendments to the COBOL '85 standard --
        intrinsic functions and corrections.

        ISO should be producing a new standard in 1997.  Don Nelson is
        the editor and has offered to answer any questions about it.

    7.2 Can I get the standards via FTP.

        The standards do not appear to be available via FTP.  This is
        probably because they are very large and are copyrighted by
        ANSI and/or ISO.

        The 1997 standard will be copyright of ISO.


8.  COBOL 6.50

    8.1 How do I compile my programs ?

        It is assumed you have installed cobol650.zip in the directory
        C:\COBOL650.  In install.doc you will find some information on
        running the compiler.

        1) Add C:\COBOL650 to the PATH

        2) Run APPEND on C:\COBOL650 :

           APPEND C:\COBOL650

        The install.doc contained in cobol650.zip refers to a program
        DPATH.COM to be run instead of APPEND. The DOS program APPEND
        seems to work too.

        3) Now you can compile your .cob files as explained in
           install.doc.

        When trying to compile sources in a directory other than that
        where the compiler is installed, the compiler terminates without
        an error.  This restriction is not documented in install.doc,
        which is probably a result of using APPEND instead of DPATH.

        The compiler accesses drive A:.  You should have a disk in this
        drive.

        Peter Mikalajunas adds :

        To avoid the need to use drive A:, you should do the following :

            subst a: c:\cobol650

        When you type A: you will drop into the C:\COBOL650 subdirectory.
        The compiler will behave normally at this point, not constantly
        searching drive A:.

        When you are done with a session do the following :

            C:
            subst a: /D


    8.2 How do I link my objects ?

        There is no linker with the COBOL 6.50 compiler.  To link
        objects you need to use the linker from MS-DOS v3.3 or earlier.

        Ralf Laemmel adds :

        You can use newer linkers, especially from newer Microsoft
        compiler products, too.

        And Peter Mikalajunas has found that :

        Tlink compiled with obj files without complaint, but the exe's
        were useless. What did work was Link version 5.31.009 which
        comes with Visual Basic for DOS. It compiled all obj files I
        tried and the exe's ran perfectly.


9.  What about OO COBOL ?

    The following is largely taken from a posting by Michael Jesse Chonoles
    (chonoles@acc.vf.ge.com) :

    "The X3J4.1 Object-Oriented COBOL Task Group has approved a technical
    report with recommendations that it be included in the next full COBOL
    Language Standard by the X3J4 committee."

    Micro Focus has an OO COBOL product. It does not conform exactly
    to the OO COBOL proposal currently being discussed, however
    -- the syntax is a subset of the current proposal with a few
    variations. For example, "object-storage section" is used instead
    of "working-storage section" for object data. Multiple inheritance,
    conformance and garbage collection are not implemented. Also,
    vocabularies are implemented though these are not currently part of
    the proposed standard.

11. Is there a COBOL to C converter ?

    Asking this question anywhere appears to generate much general
    flamage and general language wars and very little useful
    information.

    No such beast is listed in the free compilers FAQ, but an ad
    has appears in the US publication "Programmer's Shop Catalog"
    for COBOL to C (and PL/I to C) translators.  Contact :

        Micro-Processor Services,
        92 Stone Hurst Lane,
        Dix Hills,
        NY 11746

        Tel: (516) 499 4461


    A toolset for conversion from COBOL to several other languages
    is available. A tool first produces structured diagrams
    (Nassi-Shneiderman) from existing source files. Structural
    errors are identified and you can edit to correct them. Another tool
    takes those same diagrams and produces source code in one of several
    languages (COBOL, C, Ada, Basic, Clipper, dBaseIV, Fortran, Modula
    2, Natural, PL/1, etc.)

    The toolset is called XperCase by Siemens, and is available
    in the US from:

        Some years ago I was Project Leader on a software project termed
        COBTOC (COBol TO C translation). The company is by now out of
        business, but the rihts on this product were purchased by NSI
        (Network Solutions Inc., Herndon, VA, USA - Emitt McHenry was
        Chairman).

        COBTOC is actually a translator generator. It can produce a
        specialized translator for any reasonable COBOL dialect, given
        a dialect description very close to the usual syntax notation
        one can find into any COBOL Reference Manual. "semantics"
        peculiarities are also described in this way.

        Once a translator has been produced in this way, a source
        management module allows automated translation of the COBOL
        source modules. A run-time library is also automatically
        produced as a by-product of the translator.

        The COBTOC user gets a set of C files, each being the
        translation of a corresponding COBOL file. You can get K&R C,
        ANSI C, or common variants like Turbo C. The overall structure
        of the COBOL program is preserved upon translation. Identifiers
        are straightforward transformations of COBOL names. Paragraph
        structure and flow control are also preserved, like all name
        space properties attached to I/O and file management.

        The C files are compiled and linked withthe run-time library,
        which supports data handling, edition, arithmetic, direct I/O,
        file I/O and transaction management (e.g. CICS).

        Excutables are intnded to run on any platform supporting POSIX C
        compiling and standard library linkage.

        COBTOC was left by my co-workers and me in an alpha release
        state, mid 1993.

        I don't know the end of the story, but NSI should provide more
        up-to-date information about it.


    Some people consider that it is possibly cheaper to hire someone
    to do the conversion job than to have a program produce C code
    which could be quite difficult to read and maintain.

13. Information required for the FAQ.

    Corrections and additions to existing material are always welcome.

    I'd like to add a section of reviews of different COBOL books.  If
    I am sent any reviews I will collate them and add these to the FAQ.

    More information on the COBOL standards and later updates would
    be useful.

    A section covering COBOL programming could be worthwhile.
