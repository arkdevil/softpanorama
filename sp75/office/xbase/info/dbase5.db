The reason WHY I said Paradox, dBase and Approach over Access and VFP (and I've 
used them all) is that Paradox was the second easiest databse for me to learn 
and use (oddly enough dBase III+ was first), then Approach, then VFP, then 
Access.  Plus I can leverage all my existing dBase experience (not to mention 
all my exising dBase databases) with dBase for Windows.  dBase is also 
extensible with either Visual Basic custom controls, container classes from 
Borland's Object Windows Libraries, or even the Microsoft Foundation Classes.  
Use what you need to do the job: for any database needs I may have, Paradox and 
dBase (especially dBase for Windows)  best suit me.  Those are MY opinions; if 
Access better suits you, fine.  I have no problem with that.

No flames, please.
