Hi, 

Here is a VB status bar control! It's easy to use and it even works.

To use it, simply click on File - Add File and load status.dll. You 
will then see my best attempt at a button that is supposed to look
like a status bar in the toolbox.

You can now use the status bar control as if it came with Visual Basic.

The current version will (at run time) automatically force all instances of 
status bars to the bottom of the screen and will force the first instance 
to be the width of your form and the all others to be flush right. 

If the form is resized, the bar will remain "glued" to the bottom. The
first section will resize itself to the width of the form and the others
will remain glued to the bottom right.

You can change captions, colors and so forth as you would any other control.
I also added a special property (which can be accessed from the 
properties list box) that allows you to change the status bar from
displaying as down, flat or up.  

I have found that the best way to use it is to make several status bars--
one for each section you might want. They fit seemlessly next to each other.
What I usually do is put the first one down then a couple
of short ones  right on top of the long on (for line #'s and column #'s etc.) 
followed by a blank flat one to fill the bar all the way to the right.

Any questions comments or suggestions would be welcome.

If you like it, send me $10 and I'll send you the source.
