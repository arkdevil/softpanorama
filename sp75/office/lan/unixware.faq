Questions

General

Subject: G1) What is UnixWare?

UnixWare is Novell's Unix offering, combining Unix System V Release
4.2 for 80x86 processors with NetWare client connectivity, DOS Merge,
Motif, support and documentation.  It provides a graphical user
interface based on the X11R5 windowing system, and is capable of
running Unix, DOS, and/or Windows programs.

UnixWare, first released in November 1992, was the product of a
jointly-owned venture, named Univel, between Novell and Unix Systems
Laboratories (USL, then a part of AT&T).  In the spring of 1993,
Novell completed its acquisition of USL and, by extension, Univel.
USL and Univel have since been folded into the newly-formed Novell
Unix Systems Group (USG, the namesake of an earlier group by the same
name at AT&T).  One still sees the Univel name frequently, but it is
being gradually phased out over time.  In this FAQ, I will use the
phrase "Novell USG" to refer to the Unix Systems Group where once
"Univel" would have been used.

The "UNIX" trademark, previously owned by AT&T and then deeded to USL,
passed to Novell with the acquisition of USL.  After a brief period of
negotiations with rival Unix vendors Sun Microsystems, Santa Cruz
Operation, International Business Machines, and Hewlett-Packard,
Novell granted exclusive licensing rights to the UNIX trademark to
X/Open Co. Ltd., an Open Systems industry standards branding agent
based in the United Kingdom.  Henceforth, the granting of licenses for
the trademark UNIX will be handled exclusively by X/Open; eventually,
licenses will be granted only for products which exhibit conformance
with the so-called Spec1170, a set of 1,000-odd applications
programming interfaces (APIs) drawn from the following standards:

  IEEE Portable Operating System's Interface (POSIX) 1003.1
  AT&T's System V Interface Definition SVIDIII
  X/Open's XPG-4 interface specification
  "Use-based" APIs drawn from an assortment of third-party vendors

Strict conformance to Spec1170 has not yet been demanded by X/Open
(to my knowledge, no current commercial UNIX offering is fully
conformant with Spec1170) to allow grandfathering in of existing UNIX
flavors.  Strict conformance will likely be implemented in the near
future.

Subject: G2) Where can I purchase UnixWare?

You can contact Novell USG for reseller information at 1-800-638-9273
between the hours:

  Monday through Friday 5AM-6PM Pacific Time
  Saturday 8AM-2PM Pacific Time

International customers should dial 801-429-5588.

Another vendor offering UnixWare, including mixes of options not
available from Univel, is the Information Foundation.  They can be
reached at by phone at (303) 572-6486 or 1-800-GET-UNIX, or via email
at "sales@if.com".

Every mail-order software house I've contacted so far has carried
UnixWare.  This includes the following:

  Computer Discount Warehouse     Programmer's Paradise
  1-800-891-4CDW                  1-800-445-7899

  ASAP Software Express           Inmac
  1-800-248-ASAP                  1-800-323-6905

  UniPress Software               Unidirect
  1-800-222-0550                  1-800-755-8649

When dealing with mail-order houses, be sure to specify exactly what it
is that you want.  The salesperson may not _know_ that UnixWare v1.1 has
already been released, and send you a copy of 1.0 (or similar mishaps).

Subject: G3) How much does UnixWare cost?

The list price for UnixWare 1.1 (Personal Edition) is still being
quoted at $249 (for the CD-ROM version) in adverts, but you shouldn't
pay more than $200 for it.  Information Foundation used to advertise a
$166 price, but has replaced this with a "Please Call" listing.  Inmac
presently advertises a $199 PE, and other mail-order houses are right
in this range as well.

UnixWare 2.0 Personal Edition will carry a price tag (list) of $445,
while the Application Server will list at $1,695.

The current (v1.1) pricing of UnixWare makes it very cost-competitive
with Microsoft's Windows NT workstation product (whose version 3.5
typically fetches in excess of $300 in retail outlets).  This
advantage, unfortunately, may not be preserved across the transition
from version 1.1 to 2.0.  Thankfully, the software development kit
will remain aggressively priced; listing at $145.

Subject: G4) What are UnixWare's hardware requirements?  Does it run on a PC?

Yes, UnixWare runs on PCs.  The necessary hardware configuration for
installing and running UnixWare is:

* A personal computer running an Intel 80386 or higher processor
  with a minimum speed of 25MHz.
  The ISA, EISA, and MCA bus architectures are supported.
* A minimum of 8MB RAM for the Personal Edition.
* A minimum of 12 MB RAM for the Application Server.
* A minimum 80MB hard disk for the Personal Edition.
* A minimum 120 MB hard disk for the Application Server.
* A minimum 40MB if you have a second hard disk (optional).
* A 3.5-inch or 5.25-inch diskette drive for booting UnixWare.
* A serial, bus, or PS/2-compatible mouse is recommended, but not required.

Evan Leibovitch (evan@telly.on.ca) notes that, while UnixWare does not
absolutely require a 3.5" diskette drive, it is a practical necessity
in real world usage.  Many useful/necessary packages only come on 3.5"
media.  He adds that the 1.1 release supports the new 2.88MB format
3.5" floppies for those machines which support it.

Eric Raymond used to post in the Usenet group comp.unix.pc-clone.32bit
a guide to hardware compatibility for Unix versions that run on
Intel-based hardware.  While not specifically devoted to UnixWare, it
was handy for discussions of the difficulties that may be encountered
in installing Unix on PC hardware.  Unfortunately, nothing has been
heard from Raymond in recent times and, while you can probably find a
copy of the last version of the pc-clone hardware guide in the
rtfm.mit.edu archives, the information therein is getting more dated
by the minute.

Subject: G5) What is the current release/version of UnixWare?

The current version of UnixWare is release 1.1.2.  Version 2.0 of
UnixWare will be officially released to the markets on March 21, 1995.
An update to version 1.1.3 will also be available shortly, for
customers not yet wishing to upgrade fully to UnixWare 2.0.

Subject: G6) Can I upgrade from any version of UnixWare 1.1 to version 2.0?

Yes.  UnixWare 2.0 will overlay any version of UnixWare 1.1.

Subject: G7) Which system vendors will sell you a machine with UnixWare installed?

I do not currently have an official list of vendors offering bundled
UnixWare.  Can anyone supply one?  (This question has been on the FAQ
since its inception ... is anyone listening??? :-)

From the FAQ maintainer's (possibly somewhat jaded) point of view,
Novell is not terribly interested any more in getting the Personal
Edition preinstalled on desktop client machines.  Instead, they are
more concerned with having the Application Server available on
server-class systems.  Buyers of such systems probably don't need the
FAQ to help them find the box they need, so this list will attempt to
focus instead on the neglected (and always optimistic) individuals who
really do want to use UnixWare as a desktop.

Mobius Computer of Pleasanton CA will sell you an Intel box with
UnixWare preinstalled, among other Unix offerings:

  Mobius Computer

same importance to it that Usenet readers would.  They don't list a
general sales or info address; you might try sales@mobius.com or

Subject: G8) What is the UnixWare "Personal Edition"?

The UnixWare "Personal Edition" is the desktop version of UnixWare.
The following laundry list is lifted from Information Foundation's
bounce-back email information server:

UnixWare Personal Edition
        UNIX System V Release 4.2 Base System
        Printer Support
        Network Support Utilities
        Graphics Utilities
        Enhanced Application Compatibility
        Adobe Type Manager
        TypeScaler Fonts
        Networked Graphics
        X11 Windowing System
        Graphical Desktop Manager
        Windowing Korn Shell
        CD-ROM File System Support
        Ethernet Hardware Support
        Token Ring Hardware Support
        European Language Supplement
        DOS Merge for DOS/Windows Support
        Novell Network Services

The UnixWare 2.0 Personal Edition will, for the first time, also
bundle NFS in the base package.

Subject: G9) What is the UnixWare "Application Server"?

As the name implies, the Application Server is the server version of
UnixWare.  Originally, at least, the idea was that an enterprise
network would be built up of DOS, Windows, and UnixWare clients, with
a NetWare box providing file services and a UnixWare AS running
applications which would display on the PE clients.  I don't know if
this is still the plan or not.

The laundry list (again lifted from the IF literature) is:

UnixWare Application Server
        Personal Edition (Unlimited User License)
        Personal Utilities
        TCP/IP & NFS

where UnixWare Personal Utilities consists of

        Advanced UNIX Utilities
        BSD Compatibility
        Advanced Administration Utilities

(Note that the Personal Utilities, a standalone product in v1.0, is now
bundled into the software development kit [SDK]).

Subject: G10) Are there any books I can read/purchase about UnixWare?

The manuals you get with UnixWare are pretty slim indeed, and you'll
probably find yourself needing one or more of the UNIX Press books on
Unix SVR4.2 to supplement the bundled documentation.  The following is
a complete list of the Unix SVR4.2 series:

Samuel Ko (kko@sfu.ca or sko@wimsey.bc.ca) maintains the "Concise
Guide to UNIX Books", which is posted regularly to the Usenet
newsgroups misc.books.technical, alt.books.technical,

This list contains many titles of interest to UNIX users both new and
old, and is well worth the trouble to acquire.

Subject: G11) How about review articles on UnixWare?

Open Systems Today, in its February 15 1993 issue, reviewed the
initial release of UnixWare 1.0.

The June 15, 1993 PC Magazine reviewed UnixWare favorably, rating it
the Editor's Choice for "Intel Unix" above Consensys V4.2, Dell Unix
(RIP), Interactive, SCO Open Desktop, NeXTStep on Intel and Solaris
x86.  (Note that the last two were reviewed prior to release.)  The
review concluded `This just may be the Unix for the masses.'

UnixWorld magazine profiled UnixWare over a two-part series in the
July and August 1993 issues.  UnixWorld looked at UnixWare from the
traditional Unix user's point of view, predicting that `power Unix
users will dismiss UnixWare out of hand, ' but also noting the
advantages of the tight integration with NetWare.  The UnixWorld
reviews are probably much more useful to a system administrator than
an ordinary user.

Byte Magazine, after a September 1992 "Is Unix dead?" cover story that
looks rather silly now in retrospect, gave UnixWare (then still in
beta) a friendly reception in its January 1993 issue.  `On features
alone, UnixWare is one hot number: networked file, mail, printer, and
application sharing; NetWare client connectivity; DOS compatibility;
high-performance multitasking and virtual memory; a network-capable
windowing system with scalable Adobe Type Manager fonts; two levels of
hypertext help -- and these are just the highest of the high points'
opined the Byte reviewer (Tom Yager [tyager@bytepb.byte.com], Byte's
Multimedia Lab).

Subject: G12) Are there anonymous ftp / mail server sites with UnixWare archives?

Novell has an anonymous ftp service at ftp.novell.com (137.65.4.1).
UnixWare files can be found under ~ftp/pub/unixware.  UnixWare
binaries of handy things like the GNU development tools, perl, Seyon
and GhostScript are starting to show up there.

The helpful bunch at Novell Germany have set up UnixWare archives at

  ftp.novell.de://pub/unixware/usle

The ftp.novell.de site is mirrored at

  ftp.demon.co.uk://pub/mirrors/novell/usle

The US4BINR archive contains binaries for UNIX System V Release 4 for
386/486 PCs, including UnixWare.  From the US4BINR mail server:

  US4BINR is now available on wuarchive.wustl.edu in the
  /systems/svr4-pc directory. wuarchive.wustl.edu supports both
  anonymous FTP and NFS mount. wuarchive is the primary
  site for this project.

  The mail server is still available. For help, send mail to
  request@us4binr.login.qc.ca with the simple message (no special
  subject).

Subject: G13) Where can I get online information on UnixWare?

*** PHONE ***

Quoting from UnixWare documentation:

  You can speak with a Univel representative regarding Univel product
  information and services Monday through Friday between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00
  p.m. Mountain Standard Time.

  Univel's main telephone numbers are:

  * U.S. and Canada: 1-800-772-UNIX (1-800-772-8649)
  * International: 801-568-8548
  * Germany (European Support Center): +49-211-5277-744 (support for Europe,
    Middle East, and Africa)
  * Australia: +61-2-925-3000
  * Hong Kong: +852-827-2223
  * Japan: +81-3-5481-1141


*** FAX ***

You can call the 1-800-772-UNIX number outside of their normal business
hours and reach the USG FAX hot line (option 4), which enables you to
have UnixWare information FAXed back to you.

There are now two separate FaxBack services.  Choosing "information" in
response to the voice prompt leads one to the pre-sales information
FaxBack server, while choosing "technical support" provides access to
technical documents.  The hardware compatibility guide, however, is not
currently available via FaxBack.

Comments and/or suggestions regarding UnixWare can be FAXed back to
USG at 408-473-8774.

*** COMPUSERVE ***

Novell maintains a UnixWare forum on CompuServe.  If you have a
CompuServe ID and wish to access this form, type:

  GO UNIXWARE

at any CompuServe prompt.  There are message sections for General
Information, Product Information, Developers, DOS Merge, Installation,
X Windows, Networking, Device Drivers, Printing, Communications,
Applications, Bug Watchers, and Updates.

If you do not have a CompuServe ID, contact CompuServe Customer
Service at 800-848-8990 or 614-457-8650 for information on setting up
an account.

*** USENET ***

If you have access to Usenet, look into the newsgroup

news:comp.unix.unixware.

This forum entertains discussions of all issues
related to UnixWare.  Other newsgroups possibly of interest to
UnixWare users are

news:comp.unix.sys5.r4

(for discussions relating to the
System V Release 4 version of Unix, which includes Novell's UnixWare)
and

news:comp.unix.misc

(for miscellaneous discussions of Unix).

If you do not have access to Usenet, you have a variety of options.
If you have access to a Unix system, chances are good that it may
already provide Usenet access - particularly if it is at an academic
or research site.  If you do not have access to a Unix system, your
best bet is to get an account with one of the increasing number of
public-access Unix systems being set up by entrepreneurial Unix
sysadmins.  You can find the contact phone numbers for such systems in
any one of the many books on the Internet now beginning to flood the
popular press.

*** MAILING LIST ***

The news:comp.unix.unixware newsgroup is gatewayed into a
mailing list for the benefit of those users with email, but not
Usenet, access.  I quote from Evan Leibovitch's instructions for that
list:

  TO SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE/GET HELP/ETC:
  Send an appropriate message to any *one* of the following addresses,
  each of which is addressed to the list server mechanism at this site
  (listed in order of my preference):

  listproc@telly.on.ca
  univel-request@telly.on.ca
  listserv@telly.on.ca

  The body of your message should contain one of the following lines
  *AS ITS ONLY CONTENT*:

  subscribe univel Your_Full_Name      (Not your e-mail address, the system
                                        will pick that up from the headers.)
  unsubscribe univel
  recipients univel                    (gets a list of subscribers)
  help


*** EMAIL ***

Novell USG has set up a email box for support queries:

  unixware@novell.com

Email sent to this address will be automatically directed to the
appropriate staff members at USG, so long as the message body of the
letter is constructed from a form template currently being set up.
Pointers to the form template will be posted in this FAQ as soon as it
is available.  In the meantime, Novell USG asks:

  we ask that you be specific in your questions and that you
  include all pertinent information (i.e. updates installed, controllers,
  peripherals, RAM, Video, SoftWare used, versions, detailed problem
  descriptions, etc. etc.).

Similarly, queries regarding product information can be sent to:

  prodinfo@novell.com

Before Novell USG announced its email address for UnixWare support, a
helpful group of three members of European Univel Support set up an
email address to which users could send questions about UnixWare.
This email alias was:

  univel@novell.de

and will still probably generate responses.

Some other well known EMAIL addresses for UnixWare customers
(courtesy Darren Davis):

  UnixWare Developer Support (programming, compiling, linking, libs)
  devunix@novell.com

  UnixWare enhancement requests (if UnixWare could only run my toaster)
  enhance-unixware@novell.com

  Linux support questions (Gee can linux take over the world)
  /dev/null    :^)  (Sorry, I guess I am a corporate stooge)


*** FTP ***

Novell maintains an official UnixWare FTP site at ftp.novell.com.  To
access this server, you will of course need Internet access.  Type

  ftp ftp.novell.com

At the login prompt, type

  anonymous

When it asks for a password, enter your full email address.

*** WORLD WIDE WEB (WWW) ***

Novell maintains a World Wide Web (WWW) server at:

  http://WWW.Novell.COM/

European sites may prefer to visit

  http://www.novell.de/

Via the WWW server at www.novell.com, you can submit product inquiries
and technical support queries without having to use the email form
templates.  Plus, there's quite a bit of documentation there to be
perused.

For a UnixWare xmosaic binary to access the WWW server:

  ftp to ftp.novell.de
  and look in ~ftp/pub/unixware/usle/BINARIES/mosaic-2.4.mrun
  for mosaic-2.4.mrun.tar.Z.  This can be untarred into /tmp and pkgadded
  to install the Mosaic binary.  It requires Motif 1.2 runtime support;
  standard in UnixWare 1.1.

  Mosaic sources are available from ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in ~ftp/Web.

Andrew Josey (andrew@uel.co.uk) advises of another location for
xmosaic binaries:

  We have also added a pkgadd format package for mosaic including
  a class database and icon to allow graphical point and click startup.
  This is on our mail-server (mail-server@uel.co.uk).  To receive it,
  send an email to that address with the following contents:

    begin
    mail <reply-address>
    send BINARIES/mosaic-2.4.mrun/mosaic-2.4.mrun.tar.Z
    end

(There is also a mosaic-2.4.README that is obtained in the same fashion.)

Send comments on the WWW services to webmaster@novell.com

Subject: G15) Where can I find a driver for [accelerated graphics card]?

Try ftp'ing to ftp.novell.de, and look in the /pub/unixware/X
directory.  Check the README file there for a listing of currently
available drivers.  These drivers are updated on a regular basis,
and may be newer than those (and/or unavailable) on the latest OS
distribution.

Subject: G16) I have release 1.0; how do I get my release 1.1 upgrade?

Novell initially provided a free upgrade to release 1.1 to all owners
of the release 1.0 product.  This offer expired at the end of June 1994,
however.

To upgrade, UnixWare customers need to call one of the following phone
numbers and be prepared to provide their rev. 1.0 product serial numbers
or proof of purchase.

Subject: G17) What has been upgraded in release 1.1?

From the December 1993 Novell International Bulletin, the following
features and benefits of release 1.1:

* Improved quality and performance across the entire family of UnixWare
  products;

* Additional support for European languages. Along with existing
   support for English and Japanese, UnixWare 1.1 will be available in
   native versions of French, Italian, German and Spanish by the second
   quarter of fiscal year 1994.

* Additional support for popular low-cost PC hardware.

* Aggressively priced and feature-rich Software Development Kit (SDK).
   This new SDK will be very popular with ISVs and corporate developers.
   The new SDK offers the complete set of UnixWare development tools for
   a suggested retail price of US $99.

   The Software Development Kit now includes the following packages
   which used to be separate options:

    * Motif Development Tools
    * Driver Development Tools
    * Personal Utilities

* Bundled TCP/IP in Personal Edition

* Motif 1.2 and Motif wksh for greater COSE compilance

* NetWare 4.X support for file and print services

* Support for third-party compilers

Subject: G18) Is there a UnixWare user's group?

Evan Leibovitch (evan@telly.on.ca) responds:

  Yes! UUX, the UnixWare User Exchange, was founded at UniForum 1994.
  It is still in the formative stages, and is looking for any assistance
  possible from people in the UnixWare user/developer/reseller community.

  The next meeting of the UUX will take place Wednesday, October 5 1994,
  at the Jacob Javits Convention Center in New York City, held
  concurrently with the Unix Expo trade show.

  For more information contact Evan Leibovitch, evan@telly.on.ca or
  (905) 452-0504.

Subject: G19) Does UnixWare support multiprocessing?

Not currently.  Multiprocessing will be included in release 2.0, 
available March 21, 1995.

Subject: G20) Does UnixWare function as a NetWare server?

No, not at present.  UnixWare is strictly a NetWare client.  It can,
however, function as an NFS server.

Subject: U1) Are there any books I can read/purchase about UnixWare?

A good starting place is the UNIX Press UNIX SVR4.2 documentation set:

  - User's Series -
  Title                                  ISBN #
  Guide to the Unix Desktop              1-56205-114-8
  User's Guide                           0-13-017708-3

Novell has recently released:

  Novell's Guide to UnixWare 1.1
  Chris Negus and Larry Schumer
  Novell Press 1994
  ISBN: 0-7821-1292-7

Two books on Unix System V that have received good reviews are

  The Waite Group's UNIX System V Primer

  Novell Press, 1993
  ISBN: 0-7821-1376-1

There are twelve-step programs for those who have bought this book, to
help them get over their embarrassment.

And, of course, for the true neophyte or general Uniphobe, there's:

Subject: U2) Can I run DOS/Windows programs under UnixWare?

Yes.  UnixWare comes with the capability to run DOS programs via Locus
Merge and a limited version of Novell's DR-DOS 6.0 (provided).  DOS
version 5.0 may also be installed in place of DR-DOS 6.0, although
users must provide their own copy.  DOS version 6.x is currently not
compatible with Merge; the next release of Merge is projected to
support DOS 6.x.  Purchasers of the 1.0 Personal Edition are entitled
to the Windows Merge software, but may need to request their copy from:

  By Phone:              By FAX:          By Mail:
  US: 800-892-4650       303-294-0939     Univel Fulfillment Center
  Int'l: 303-297-8372    (US & Int'l)     P.O. Box 5205
                                          Denver, CO 80217-9259

Microsoft Windows is _not_ included in any UnixWare Edition; you must
supply your own.  You may also replace the bundled Novell DOS with MS-DOS,
although currently no releases newer than 5.0 are supported.

The current version of Merge emulates a 286 processor, and cannot run
Windows programs specifically requiring an 80386, 80486 or Pentium 
processor, nor can it run Windows in 386 enhanced mode.  Known 
applications that require such capabilities include:

* Borland Quattro Pro
* Microsoft Access
* WordPerfect for Windows 6.0

The Merge in UnixWare 2.0 is rumoured to be capable of emulating a 386
(although not of running Windows in enhanced mode).  This Merge may
also be available in one of the PTFs for UnixWare 1.1.x.
  
Subject: U3) Can DOS NetWare users log in to a UnixWare box via IPX?

Yes.  Dave W. of Novell explains the NetWare Virtual Terminal:

  [NVT] is a method for a DOS user to communicate via IPX to a
  UnixWare machine.  You load a TSR on the dos box that redirects
  int14 or int6b (serial communications) over an NVT protocol to the
  UnixWare machine who establishes a login session.  With the TSR
  loaded, you run a terminal emulator that uses the standard bios
  interrupts (rather than going straight to the hardware) and you've
  got a connection.  There are some terminal packages that support
  NVT directly (without the TSR)
  For example: Rational Data Systems - PopTerm.

MS-Kermit and ProComm Plus for Windows support INT14.  TERM and TinyTERM
from Century Software, and MultiView from JSB, also purportedly can work
with the NVT service.

Only the UnixWare application server supports remote logins via NVT;
the UnixWare Personal Edition does not provide this capability.

Subject: U4) Are there CD-ROMs of freeware binaries precompiled for UnixWare?

Yes.  The Prime Time Freeware software development kit for UnixWare
includes not only gcc and g++, but some oft-used non-development
utilities such as XFree86, Emacs, TeX, GhostScript, Tcl/Tk, perl
and Taylor UUCP as well.

Subject: U5) Why can't I type in an "at sign" (@) at a command prompt?

This is because, incredible though it may seem, UnixWare ships with
the same terminal configuration tailored twenty-odd years ago for 
ASR-33 teletypes.  '@' is thus the line-kill character.  

To take care of serial/dialup/telnet/rlogin logins, users should put
the following line into their shell initialization file (.profile for
Bourne and ksh users, .cshrc for C-shell users):

  stty erase '^H' kill '^U' intr '^C'

(Type these in just as you see them; there's no need to try and
 enter the actual control characters, and many reasons not to anyway.)

The stty command will take care of C-shell users for all time, since the
.cshrc file is read in by every instance of the shell (unless the -f flag
is used, but that's typically for noninteractive shells).  Users of other
shells should put the following lines into their .Xdefaults file to
ensure that shells started within xterms are properly set up:

  *Terminal*ttyModes:     erase ^h intr ^c kill ^u
  *xterm*ttyModes:        erase ^h intr ^c kill ^u

If you remotely log in to your UnixWare box from another system that
places a "Delete" key at the upper right corner of the main keypad, you
will have to execute the command

  stty erase '^?'

to inform the shell that your current keyboard is slightly different.
Otherwise, you may end up seeing things like "la^Hs: Command not found".
The .Xdefaults file on the remote system should also be configured 
accordingly.

UnixWare 2.0 has reportedly fixed at least the '@' problem.

Subject: U6) How can I access the standard UNIX man pages from the command line?

Include the following in your shell startup files:

.profile (/usr/bin/sh or /usr/bin/ksh):

  MANPATH=/usr/flib/books/man
  export MANPATH
  PATH=$PATH:/usr/ucb

.cshrc (/usr/bin/csh):

  setenv MANPATH /usr/flib/books/man
  set path=($path /usr/ucb)

Alternately, talk to your SysAdmin about setting up the symbolic links
for the man pages described in the next section.

Subject: U7) Why can't I run /usr/bin/dos inside an xterm?

Your xterm must be exactly 25 lines in height.  The width does not
have to be 80 characters, interestingly, although you probably should
set it to such rather than tempt fate.

Subject: U8) How do I get (MS)-Windows to run within an X Window?

You need to tell Windows to use the Merge X Windows display and mouse
drivers, rather than the VGA driver provided with Windows.  This is
easiest to do while logged in and running Windows full-screen on the
console.

To effect this change, bring your DOS window to full-screen so that
Windows can access the display.  Start up the "Windows Setup" program
from the Program Manager's "Main" group.  Don't be daunted if you
can't use the mouse to double-click on the program; simply use Alt-F
to bring up the Program Manager's "File" menu, and then use the right
arrow key to select the "Windows" menu.  You can then use the up or
down arrows to select the "Main" item, and press <return> to select
the "Main" group.  Now it's a simple matter of using the arrow keys to
select "Windows Setup", and pressing <return> to start it.

Once there, use Alt-O to bring up the "Options" menu, and select
"Change System Settings".  Use the <tab> key to select the different
fields in the dialog box that comes up, and the arrow keys to choose
an item from within the list of choices for that field.

What you want is for "Display" to be set to "DOS Merge Windows/X",
"Keyboard" to be set to "Enhanced 101 or 102 key US and Non US
keyboards" and for "Mouse" to be set to "DOS Merge Mouse".  Scroll
through the list of selections for the display and mouse drivers until
you find the entry "Other (Requires disk from OEM)" and select that
entry.  When prompted for the pathname of the OEM disk, replace the
"A:" in the box with "C:\USR\LIB\MERGE\WINDOWS".  Select the
appropriate entry from the dialog box that comes up.  The keyboard
entry you can select from the standard Windows entries.

You can change the Windows system settings by running the setup
program from within a DOS windows as follows:

  setup

This might be more convenient (and less worrisome) than bringing up
Windows full-screen.  All the necessary keys (function keys, etc) seem
to work OK in the DOS window, so long as you're logged in from the
console.

It is possible to start up "setup" in an xterm running /usr/bin/dos
(or on a serial terminal or dialup, for that matter), but may be a bit
more tricky if you can't use or don't have the standard function keys.
<Esc>-1 (the escape key, followed by the 1 key) through <Esc>-0 give
you F1-F10 (<Esc>-; and <Esc>-: are F11 and F12, respectively) while
<Esc>-f, <Esc>-g, <Esc>-t and <Esc>-v are the left-, right-, up- and
down-arrow keys, respectively.

Subject: U9) The colors are screwed up when I run Windows.  How to fix this?

Put the following into your .Xdefaults file:

  dos*InstallColorMap:    True

Alternately, you could feed this to the X resource database:

  echo "dos*InstallColorMap:    True" | xrdb -merge

This may cause color "flashing" as you move your mouse in and out of
the Windows window, but will ensure that you get the proper colors in
Windows.

Subject: U10) How can I set the size of the X window that Windows runs in?

You can set the Windows X window to an arbitrary size by adding lines
similar to the following to your .Xdefaults file (or, alternatively,
feeding them to xrdb):

  dos*windowsHeight:      988
  dos*windowsWidth:       1260

These almost exactly fill the display on my 1280x1024 monitor when
running Windows; the actual values you use will depend upon the size
of your monitor, of course.

Subject: U11) How can I change the fonts on the icon labels in the UnixWare desktop?

Ummm...

...you can't.  The font is (at present) hard-coded.

Subject: U12) Why does Word 6.0 say that share isn't loaded, when it is?

To get Microsoft Word 6.0 to run atop Merge, place the following line in 
your autoexec.bat file immediately before the line loading share.exe:

  merge set drive local

Word 6.0a is rumoured to have fixed some other problems that arise
when running atop Merge.

Subject: U13) Can I mount the DOS partition on my disk as a UNIX filesystem?

Stock UnixWare does not allow the mounting of DOS partitions as UNIX
filesystems.  You will need an add-on filesystem, such as the freely-
available pcfs package, to be able to mount a DOS partition as a
UNIX filesystem.  This package can be found at:

  ftp.novell.de://pub/unix/unixware/unixware/08

in the file pcfs.tar.

You can, however, access the DOS partition from within Merge.  When you
run DOS (or Windows) atop Merge, the DOS partition on your hard disk
will show up as drive E:.

Subject: U14) Why can't I search for patterns in manual page output?

The traditional UNIX manual pages are not shipped in their troff source
form, but instead are shipped in preprocessed (catman) format.  (You 
won't find any man[0-9] directories in /usr/flib/books/man, only
cat[0-9].)  These preprocessed man pages contain copius backspaces,
intended for creating emphasis (underlining, &c) when printed out on
a screen (using appropriate output filters) or on paper.

Unfortunately, all those backspaces confound attempts to search through
the output of man piped directly into more (the standard method).
The way to get around this is to pipe man output as follows:

  man topic | col -b | more


Subject: U15) How can I print to a UnixWare printer from within DOS/Windows?

First, ask your system administrator to set up a printer for use
within DOS/Windows, as detailed in the SysAdmin section of this FAQ.

From within DOS, the printer set up by your system administrator will
be accessible as LPT1:.

Within Windows, go to Control_Panel->Printers.  Add a new printer,
connected to LPT1.DOS (note that this is NOT identical to LPT1;
it is a separate entry under the "Connect" dialog box).  Set the
other parameters of the printer just as you would under "ordinary"
Windows.  Note that this is the place, rather than the UnixWare
doslp printer setup, where the printer is actually identified (by
selecting it from the list of available printers, or loading a
vendor's driver disk).

If the printer you are printing to is a PostScript printer, you
may need to perform one final tweak.  By default, the Windows
PostScript printer driver will prepend a <control-D> ('\004'
character) to the PostScript code being sent to the printer.  This
is a hack, intended by the Windows driver to reset the printer
prior to starting the job.  However, some software in the UNIX world 
(notably, Adobe's Transcript filters) look for the magic number
"%!" at the beginning of a file as a flag that the file represents
PostScript code.  Lacking this magic number, which would be the case
for a file beginning with a <control-D> character, the data is taken
to be plain text, which is run through a text-to-PostScript converter.

What this boils down to is that your Windows PostScript output may
be printed out as text (very confusing to naive users), with the
little inscription "\004" leading the parade.  Not good.

(Microsoft falses accuses UNIX of being to blame, opining that 
 <control-D> is the UNIX "end-of-file" character and asserting that
 UNIX rejects any data after the "EOF" character.  Well, such are
 the privileges of a present-day monopoly.)

Enough history.  How to fix?  Well, just for your edification, take
a look at the printers.wri file in the windows directory (probably
D:\WINDOWS on your system), and look for the word "unix".  This is
where Microsoft tries to lay the blame on UNIX, and spells out the
solution.  Basically, you must open up the WIN.INI file within 
Windows Notepad, and look for the line like the following:

  [PrinterName, LPT1.DOS]

that corresponds to your UNIX printer.  Add the following entry to
the parameters settings that following this heading:

  CtrlD=0

(That is a zero to the right of the equals sign.)  Exit and restart
Windows and things should now work.

Note that this solution does NOT work if you have selected
"PostScript Printer" as the printer name/type in the Windows printer
driver selection list.  It also does not seem to work for the Apple
LaserWriter printer (in fact, I believe that _is_ the "PostScript
Printer" driver).  Apparently, you must choose an actual PostScript
printer model from the list; a reasonably educated guess is probably
sufficient, as PostScript is relatively device-independent.

Subject: U16) How can I repeat the last command by using ^N etc?

If your shell is /bin/sh or /bin/csh, you can't.  Try getting tcsh,
say off the Prime Time SDK.

If your shell is the Korn shell (/bin/ksh), do 

  set -o emacs

If you prefer vi style, try

  set -o vi


Subject: U17) What is the data format of the /stand/image (red link screen) file?

It is a straight VGA memory dump.

Subject: U18) Tar archives created on UnixWare don't untar properly on SunOS/BSD?

Martin Sohnius (msohnius@novell.co.uk) explains:

Traditionally, tar never stored any info about directories (or specials).
On extraction, directories were created as and when needed to recreate the
files in them.  Owner, group and permissions of a directory simply
defaulted to whoever did the un-tar and his/her umask setting.  On SunOs
and SCO Unix, tar still works this way.  Hence you have all these "fixperms"
type scripts.

SVR4 and POSIX extended the spec, and the "new" tar now stores i-node
information for directories as well.  This is how UW tar works, and
unfortunately (and wrongly, IMHO) there is no "compatibility option"
to write an old-style tar archive without directories.

Because what now happens, is that UW's tar stores a directory like a
zero-length file, but with the extra info that it's a directory.
"Old-style" tar ignores this extra info and, on extraction, creates a
zero-length file.  When it then tries to populate the directory, it
can't create it because an ordinary file by that name already exists.

One solution:

On recent SunOS versions, there is a directory /usr/5bin which
contains System V compatible programs.  In there is the utility ustar,
which is the POSIX (and UW) tar and which *can* extract an archive written
on UnixWare.  (BTW, /usr/5bin also has cpio in there!)

Subject: U19) Is there a UNIX utility to extract Macintosh BinHex (.hqx) files?

Check out the "mcvert" package.  It can be found at the URL

ftp://sumex-aim.stanford.edu/info-mac/cmp/mcvert-215.shar

There are a variety of other UNIX/Macintosh compatibility utilities at
this same location.

Subject: U20) How can I make the CD-ROM appear as a drive under DOS/Windows?

Here are two solutions from Martin Sohnius:

1 Use the DOS command SUBST to assign a drive letter
to C:\cdrom1.

But:  the DR-DOS 6.0 supplied with UW does not support
the SUBST command under UW.  Draw your own conclusions :-)

2 If you only need to do this once, mount the CD-ROM and
start DOS from the console (i.e. after <Alt-PrScn> h) with
the command

  HOME=/cdrom1 dos

The CD-ROM will be Drive D.  But note that you must now 
address your actual home directory as C:\home\yourname from
DOS.

Subject: U21) How can I run Windows straight from the command line?

The plain "win" command is supposed to work, although it doesn't for
me.  Instead, I use the following:

  dos +x +m4 /path/to/Windows/win

where I substitute the actual (full) pathname of win.com into the
above command line.  For example, on my personal system, this is
/home/vlcek/windows/win.

If your Windows setup involves connections to NetWare servers (for
example, via drive connections to NetWare servers in the file
manager), you may wish to put an login command into your autoexec.bat
file to avoid authentication problems.

Subject: U22) Can I run a Windows program "standalone"?

Something of a Wabi-like effect can be achieved by running a Windows
program in the following fashion:

  dos +x +m4 /path/to/Windows/win /full/path/win_prog

In fact, this is precisely the fashion in which the same effect is
achieved in DOS.  The program is not truly running "standalone"; if
you iconify it, you will see the ubiquitous Windows background and an
iconified Program Manager.  But it does bring up the desired program
full-screen, and the technique may help avoid confusing naive users.

Subject: U23) How can I log in to a NetWare server without using the graphical login?

Use the following command from your text-mode login:

  nwlogin servername/username

substituting the NetWare server's name for servername and your login
name on that server for username.  Be sure to include the
forward slash in the nwlogin command.

If this command succeeds, you will see the NetWare server's files
appear in a directory beneath the UnixWare directory /.NetWare.
A symbolic link to this directory, named netware, may also be
present in your home directory.

Subject: U24) Setting the system default printer from the desktop doesn't work?!

The desktop utilities allow a user only to set up the default printer
for his/her own individual use.  They does NOT set the system default
printer, even if run by the system owner.

Subject: U25) How do I delete a file whose name begins with a dash (-)?

Not really a UnixWare-specific FAQ, but without a doubt the most
FA'd Q for UNIX in general.

There's only two correct ways to do this (ignore all other methods),
which differ only depending upon your current directory.  If the file
you wish to delete (let's say it's named "-x") is in your current
directory, then execute the following command:

  rm ./-x

If it is in a different directory, precede the file name with the
complete path:

  rm /path/to/directory/-x

Again: ignore all other methods that may be suggested to you.  That is
an order.

SYSADMIN

Subject: S1) What books on UnixWare system administration might I read/purchase?

Well, let's start with the UNIX Press books:

  - Administration Series -
  Title                                  ISBN #
  Basic System Administration            0-13-042573-7
  Advanced System Administration         0-13-042565-6
  Network Administration                 0-13-017633-8
  PC-Interface Administration            0-13-066820-6
  Audit Trail Administration             0-13-066887-7

Mick Galvin (mick@ddiq.com) adds:

  As I think one of the points of Unixware is the integration of Netware
  with Unix I would highly recommend "Novell's Guide to Integrating UNIX and
  NetWare Networks" by James E. Gaskin, published by Novell PRESS. This is
  a *very* current book (1993) and amongst other things offers thoughts on
  topics like why netware for unix is not available on UnixWare (even though
  the Univel fax back server suggests it is!) It is sprinkled with humour.

  Novell's Guide to Integrating UNIX and NetWare Networks
  James E. Gaskin, Novell Press, 1993
  ISBN: 0-7821-1129-7

A must for Unix sysadmins is:

  UNIX Power Tools
  Jerry Peek, Tim O'Reilly, and Mike Loukides
  O'Reilly and Associates/Random House 1993
  ISBN 0-679-79073-X

This book combines 1000+ pages of text-mode Unix advice with a CD-ROM
of precompiled binaries for various popular UNIX platforms (including
SCO, which should run on UnixWare) of a large variety of useful
text-mode applications.

Subject: S2) How can I change my system's name?

From the command line, you can use the setuname utility:

  setuname -n <newname>

You can also use sysadm (either invoking it as such from the command
line, or from the UnixWare desktop as System_Setup->Extra_Admin).
Select

  system_setup->nodename->set->Network node name

and change the name found there.

You will also need to change the hostname entries in the following
files if you have networking installed:

  /etc/net/ticlts/hosts
  /etc/net/ticots/hosts
  /etc/net/ticotsord/hosts

These files deal with the loopback transport mechanism; each typically
consists of a single line of the form "<hostname><tab><hostname>".
You should change both instances of the host name.  And don't forget:

  /etc/hosts
  /etc/uucp/Systems.tcp

DON'T listen to those who recommend you use "uname -S <newname>", by
the way.  This sets not only the node name (which is what you want to
change) but the "system" name (which is initialized to UNIX_SV and
should remain that way) as well.  The latter is almost certainly not
necessary.

Subject: S3) What traditional Unix utilities have been left out of the UnixWare PE?

A common complaint among long-time Unix users is the omission of
numerous standard Unix utilities from the Personal Edition.  While
ordinary users might not typically use these commands, shell scripts
do, and thus Univel may have - if inadvertently - introduced yet
another Unix version incompatibility into the already-too-large mix.

Among the items lacking in the Personal edition are: the C and Korn
shells (the Windowing Korn Shell [wksh] _is_ included, however),
banner, calendar, head, join and dc.  These commands _are_ available,
however, in the Advanced Utilities module (an add-on optional
package).

Most, if not all, of these, utilities are included in the UnixWare SDK,
which bundled the "Personal Utilities" of v1.0.  GNU replacements for
many, if not all, of these can also be found on the Prime Time or 
Unix Power Tools CD-ROMs.

Oh, and of course TCP/IP was left out of the release 1.0 Personal
Edition, too, but is bundled with 1.1.  (NFS, however, is NOT
included.)

Subject: S4) Does UnixWare come with TCP/IP and/or NFS?

The Release 1.0 Personal Edition does not include TCP/IP or NFS in the
basic system.  A TCP/IP+NFS package is available from Univel; a
similar offer, plus a TCP/IP-only option, is available from
Information Foundation.

Release 1.1 does include TCP/IP in the Personal Edition, but not NFS.
NFS remains an extra-cost option.  This will also be the case for
UnixWare 2.0.

TCP/IP and NFS are bundled with the UnixWare Application Server in
both release 1.0 and 1.1.

Subject: S5) I've installed release 1.1.  Where's my TCP/IP?

Shame on you.  Page 1 of the UnixWare 1.1 Release Notes states:

  TCP/IP is a separate package on the CD-ROM or tape medium and must
  be installed in a separate step [...] after the base installation 
  and UnixWare 1.1 Post Install.

The package set that you must install is named tcpset.

Note that tcpset does not include NFS.  NFS is a separate package set,
named nfsset.

Subject: S6) I've installed TCP/IP.  Where's NFS?

NFS is not included in the tcpset package set in UnixWare 1.1.  It is
loaded as a separate package set, named nfsset.  This will be in the
Application Server distribution media; it is on separate media in the
Personal Edition.

Subject: S7) Can I replace the stock UnixWare X server with something faster?

Yes.  Several vendors sell X servers which can be used to speed up X
on your UnixWare system.  Typically, these vendors will also sell you
drivers for specific cards as well.  A partial list of such vendors
follows:

There is also XFree86.  From David Wexelblat's 
announcement of the release of XFree86 2.1:

  XFree86 is a port of X11R5 that supports several versions of Intel-based
  Unix and Unix-like operating systems.  The XFree86 servers are derived
  from X386 1.2, which was the X server distributed with X11R5.  This
  release consists of many new features and performance improvements as well
  as many bug fixes.  The release is available as source patches against the
  MIT X11R5 code, as well as binary distributions for many architectures.

  Source patches are available to upgrade 2.1 to 2.1.1.  These and source
  patches for 2.1 based on X11R5 PL26, from MIT, and as an upgrade from
  XFree86 2.0 are available via anonymous FTP from:

       ftp.x.org (under /R5contrib/XFree86)
		(note that this is not in place at the time of the posting)
       ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)
       ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)
       ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de (under /pub/pc/src/XFree86)

  Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information on
  which files you need to get to build your distribution (which will depend
  on whether this is a new installation or an upgrade from an earlier
  version of XFree86).

Subject: S8) Why can't I access the CD-ROM drive after I've just installed from it?

Bill Rosenblatt writes:

  This is a known bug that is supposed to be corrected for release 1.1.
  There's a relatively simple workaround:

   1. Shut down your machine.
   2. Open the machine and remove the SCSI adapter card.
   3. Leave the cover off and reboot.  The system will print an error
      message, but it will come up.
   4. Shut down again.
   5. Replace the SCSI card and put the cover back on the machine.
   6. Reboot again.  The system will rebuild the kernel, which will
      take a few minutes.  Then it will tell you to reboot.  Do so.
   7. When the system comes up again, the CD-ROM should be accessible.

Another method I received from UnixWare tech support proceeds as follows:

  When the CD-ROM driver seemingly drops out of sight in UnixWare, one
  cannot read from a CD, nor can one mount a cdfs file system.

  To correct this, first determine the proper name of your CD-ROM device
  driver. Change directory to /dev/cdrom and do an ls. There will be a
  driver file there in the form "cxtxlx" where the x's are SCSI controller
  number, tag numberm and logical unit number respectively. (e.g. the driver
  will be something like "c0t4l0" or c0t3l1") Write this name down!

  Next, it is necessary to create a "raw device." Change directory to /dev
  and "mkdir rcdrom" to create a directory called /dev/rcdrom. Then change
  to this new directory and make nodes for a CD based on the name found in
  /dev/cdrom.

                 mknod c0t4l0 c 0 0
                 mknod cdrom1 c 0 0

  These commands in succession are "make node <device driver> see-zero-zero"
  and "make node cdrom1 see-zero-zero." Note that the next-to-last character
  in the device driver name is an "ell" not a "one."

  While still in the /dev/rcdrom directory, make the whole directory 
  readable, writable, and executable to everyone.

                 chmod 0777 .
                 chmod 0777 *

  and everything should be fine. You can check by clicking on the
  "Disks Etc." icon to see if the CD-ROM icon is there.


Subject: S9) Why does my data comm package lose characters constantly at high speeds?

Bill Rosenblatt again:

   The odds are good that the problem is with the UART on your
   serial interface card.  If you have a relatively low-end PC,
   you probably have an old-style UART that interrupts the CPU after
   it receives every character.  Unix usually handles serial interrupts
   at a low level (lower than DOS does, for example), so it can't keep
   up if the speed is too high, usually above 9600bps.

   To fix this, you need to get a new UART, a 16550 UART that has
   a 16-byte buffer.  The 16540 UART, with a 2-byte buffer, may also
   be enough of an improvement.  If your UART isn't in a socket,
   then you will have to replace the entire card.  Luckily, these
   are not very expensive--about $40 for a single-port card or
   $70 for a standard PC multi-port card.

   Additionally, you need a device driver
   that knows how to take advantage of the UART's buffering.  
   UnixWare has such a device driver (asyhp), but the current version is
   known to be flaky.  Novell should have a fix for this available on
   ftp.novell.com before 1.1 comes out.  In any case, here's
   what you need to do to enable the driver, courtesy of Joao Costa
   (jcosta@quimic.pt):
   
   Just go to /etc/conf/sdevice.d, edit asyhp and turn N to Y for
   the ports you want, then edit asyc and turn Y to N on those ports.
   Rebuild the kernel and, when the new kernel boots, you'll have a status
   message about your 16550 ports.

Subject: S10) How can I make or get an emergency boot floppy?

Release 1.1 comes with the ability to create an EBF by one's self.
Insert a blank floppy in the drive, and execute as root:

  /usr/sbin/emergency_disk diskette1

Release 1.0 users must ftp the EBF from ftp.novell.com:

  ...you can now generate your own Emergency Boot
  Floppy (ebf) for UnixWare 1.0.  There is an ebf update available
  on ftp.novell.com (and on CompuServe).  The file is ebf.tar and is
  located in /pub/unixware/Updates.  This package DOES NOT create an ebf, but
  installs a utility to do so.

  Get ebf.tar, and as usual untar it.  chmod the .run file to be
  executable and then execute it to install the package.

  Once the package is installed, execute the command
  /usr/sbin/emergency_disk diskette1 (or diskette2).  This ought to
  do it.

Martin Sohnius (msohnius@novell.co.uk) warns:

`BEWARE!  There is a major security risk with the EBF.  This is pretty
  obvious to any knowledgable user, so there is no point not to warn you
  against it here:  the only thing preventing anyone who has access to the
  hardware, and has an EBF from any UW machine, from becoming root on your
  system is not knowing the system's serial number.  This, however, is
  printed on the third boot floppy, and, moreover, is displayed by one of the
  desktop utilities.  Since any EBF will boot any system (provided you give
  it the correct serial number), you better lock up your floppy drives!'

Note that the EBF can only boot a UnixWare 1.x system with an intact
root file system.  The EBF alone is not sufficient to boot UnixWare
1.x.  This may restrict the utility of the EBF somewhat.

Subject: S11) How do I set a dialup password on UnixWare for a specific port?

Andrew Josey of Unix Systems Labs Europe (a.josey@uel.co.uk) provides
the following guide:

  Two files must be created in the /etc directory, and for ease of
  use you can add a user (say called dialup).

  (1) /etc/d_passwd
  ------------------

  This is the dialup password file.

  # ls -l /etc/d_passwd
  -rw-------   1 root     root          70 May 13 07:44 /etc/d_passwd
  #

  This contains entries for login shells (uucico, ksh and sh).
  Usually there is no additional password for uucico.
  Interactive logins (ksh, and sh) have passwords.

  The encrypted password must be put in the file, note spaces and position
  of the colon delimiters are critical.

  # cat /etc/d_passwd
  /usr/lib/uucp/uucico::
  /usr/bin/ksh:66NOJGfJw4I.A:
  /usr/bin/sh:66NOJGfJw4I.A:
  #

  (2) /etc/dialups
  -----------------
  The second file /etc/dialups dictates which devices are
  to have the dialup password prompt

  # cat /etc/dialups
  /dev/tty00
  /dev/tty01h


  (3) Setting the password
  ------------------------
  To set the password, I have a login entry for a user dialup (this 
  just executes date as the login shell).

  Thus on the day to change the password

    i)

    # passwd dialup
    New password:
    Re-enter new password:
    #

    ii)

    # grep dialup /etc/shadow|cut -f2 -d":" >>/etc/d_passwd

    This appends the new dialup onto the end of the d_passwd file.

    iii)

    Edit the file with vi to place the new encrypted password
    in the appropriate fields marked XXXX below:

    /usr/lib/uucp/uucico::
    /usr/bin/ksh:XXXX:
    /usr/bin/sh:XXXX:

Subject: S12) How do I configure electronic mail on UnixWare?

From another machine that is already properly connected for email,
send a message to Andrew Josey's mail server at USL Europe to receive
some hints:

  mail-server@novell.co.uk

The message body should be:

  begin
  reply <your-email-address>
  send HINTS/MAIL/README
  end

where, of course, you have substituted your actual email address for
"<your-email-address>".

Subject: S13) How many updates are there, what are they, and where do I get them?

Update 5, the first for v1.1 and known as update 1.1.1, involves the 
Pentium-optimizing compiler which was inadvertently left out of the
1.1 SDK and other minor fixes.  It is available on 3.5" floppies or
CD-ROM directly from Novell, as well as via ftp:

  ftp.novell.com://pub/unixware/UNXWRE11/COREOS/upd111.tar

Update 1.1.1 for UnixWare 1.1 is itself at revision 1.1.  (Finally, some
unity in the Unix world, eh? :-)  Only a few individuals who downloaded
update 1.1 from the Internet shortly after it was released are likely to
have revision 1.0 of Update 1.1.1; to verify which revision you have on
your system, perform a "pkginfo -l update111".  If revision 1.0 has been
installed, patch ptf155.tar can be downloaded from the Internet to
update the broken X server (which caused problems with SCO X binaries)
in the 1.0 package.

UnixWare 1.1 and the UnixWare 1.1 SDK should _both_ be installed prior
to installing update 1.1.1.

Update 1.1.2 for UnixWare 1.1 can be found at:

  ftp.novell.com://pub/unixware/UNXWRE11/COREOS/upd112.tar

An update 1.1.3 for UnixWare 1.1 is expected early in 1995.

There are/were eight (8) updates to release 1.0, not all of which will
you typically need.  These updates are to be applied to version 1.0
only; all changes have been merged into version 1.1.

The v1.0 updates are (listed by their file names on the UnixWare ftp
archive server):

  updte1.tar - First UnixWare update
  updte2.tar - Update 1.0.2
  updte3.tar - Update 1.0.3
  upbnu4.tar - Basic Networking Utilities (uucp, serial comm, ttymon) Update 4 
  mipx.tar - Newer, faster Merge IPX; must have Advanced Merge installed
  mhs.tar - Fixes to MHS mail services; replaces earlier mhs.tar versions
  atmtp.tar - NFS automounter update 1.0.4
  nsupdt.tar - NetWare API Library update 1.0.4, fixes NetWare automounter

The first four of these are those of greatest interest to Usenet
readers.  Note that all of updte1/updte2/updte3 need not be installed;
Update 1.0.3 includes effectively replaces, and adds to, Update 1.0.3.
Thus UnixWare sysadmins can simply install Update 1.0.3 after the
first update is installed, and leave out Update 1.0.2 altogether.

All of these are available from the UnixWare ftp archive server:

  ftp.novell.com:~ftp/pub/unixware/Updates

They are also available on ftp.novell.de.  Andrew Josey
(andrew@uel.co.uk) adds:

  and also from our automated mail server which carries binaries/sources etc
  for UnixWare and also mirrors the ftp sites.

  To get a list of Updates from our mail server:

	mail mail-server@uel.co.uk

  with a msg containing:

	begin
	reply   <your-email-address-here!>
	index Updates
	end

  Use send with a filename to request a file. Note that the requests are
  case sensitive, for example to get the latest BNU fix:

	send MIRRORS/ftp.novell.com/pub/unixware/Updates/updbnu4.tar

Subject: S14) How do I know which updates I've already got installed?

Updates will show up as installed packages; from the UnixWare desktop,
double click:

  System_Setup->Application_Setup

Be patient while the installed applications are cataloged.  When you get the  
browser showing installed packages, you will be able to see the installed  
updates.

If you are the impatient sort, Andrew Josey (andrew@uel.co.uk) suggests:

  I cancel the cataloging, and then hit

	View
	  Installed Appl'ns
	    All

  Which is usually quicker... and ok when you know you've not reinstalled
  anything new recently.

Subject: S15) How can I make the man pages accessible from the command line?

The following symbolic links will enable users to access the standard
UNIX man pages without further action on their part:

  ln -s /usr/flib/books/man /usr/share/man
  ln -s /usr/flib/bin/fman /usr/bin/man

Subject: S16) Are there disk compression utilties for UnixWare?

Programmed Logic sells such a drop-in replacement compressed file
system that, among other things, can be installed as the root
partition and can be NFS-exported.  Programmed Logic claims that it
can double a file system's capacity.  For information on the Desktop
File System (DTFS), contact:

Subject: S17) How do I install a package downloaded from one of the ftp servers?

Rick Richardson (rick@digibd.com) explains:

  You can untar the stuff anywhere convenient, say,
  under /tmp, and then:

    pkgadd -d /tmp

  The pkgname is optional.  Note that the -d flag assumes that if the
  argument begins with a '/', then its a package in filesystem format.
  Otherwise, its a magic cookie (e.g. diskette1) to pick a storage device.
  I.E., this won't work:

    cd /tmp; pkgadd -d .

Subject: S18) How can I speed up the loading of Windows programs from floppies?

If you find yourself loading a Windows program more than once, for
whatever reason, you might appreciate Rick Richardson's "Handy trick
#1427":

  Use the file manager to copy each
  installation floppy to d:\diskN where N is the disk number.
  Then, you can try to install a program as many times as you
  want without waiting for floppies.  Just run D:\DISK1\SETUP
  from the file manager.  At least with Word, setup seems
  to understand that the files aren't coming from floppies
  and will just proceed to install everything it needs
  from d:\disk1, d:\disk2, etc. without further prompting.

  Discovered purely by accident - I had the disks in
  d:\w1, d:\w2, etc. and after setup finished with w1,
  it said it couldn't find d:\disk2\somefile.  Aha I say!

(FAQ maintainer's observation: I believe this is how some Windows
software is organized on CD-ROMs for installation - that might be why
the Windows setup program understands it.)

Subject: S19) Why has fingertip librarian suddenly stopped working?

An authorization code file for the flib shipped with release 1.0
inexplicably carried an expiration date of 12/31/93.  There is a
trivial fix for this: 

  $ mv /usr/flib/authorization /usr/flib/authorization.old

flib should now work again.  This problem has been fixed in v1.1.

Subject: S20) How can I get my 3COM 3C503 board to work?

Try disabling shared memory on the card.

Subject: S21) How can I set up my network adapter for 10base-T (twisted pair) wiring?

Specify "BNC" as the transceiver type.  This enables the internal
transceiver on the card, which is used by both BNC and 10base-T
connections.

Subject: S22) How can I change [kernel tunable parameter]?

The following is quoted verbatim from a UnixWare TechFlash from June 1993:

  To increase file limit size (equivelent to
  ulimit):

    SFSZLIM - Soft file size limit.
    HFSZLIM - Hard file size limit.

  To increase user data (process heap and
  brk(2)) area:
  
    SDATLIM - Soft data limit.
    HDATLIM - Hard data limit.
  
  To increase user stack (stack segment) area:
  
    SSTKLIM - Soft stack limit.
    HSTKLIM - Hard stack limit.
  
  To increase address space (brk(2) area) for
  process:
  
    SVMMLIM - Soft Virtual Memory limit.
    HVMMLIM - Hard Virtual Memory limit.

The procedure to change these tunable parameters is documented
in the UnixWare System Administration - System Performance
Administration manual, Chapter 3.  To change these parameters,
login or su to root and:

	# cd /etc/conf/bin

	# ./idtune SFSZLIM 0x7FFFFFFF

Change all the parameters that affect you.  The idtune command
changes SFSZLIM to the unlimited setting.  You also may specify
a lower value than this if you do not want it set to unlimited.  
You can also see each tunable parameter's current setting by
doing the following (using SFSZLIM for example):

  # ./idtune -g SFSZLIM
  0x1000000       0x1000000       0x2000  0x7FFFFFFF

The first value is the current setting, the second is the
default setting, the third is the minimum value, and the last is
the maximum value.

After all tunable paramters have been changed, you need to
rebuild the kernel and shutdown the system:

  # ./idbuild -B

  # cd / ; shutdown -g0 -y

Subject: S23) Why does my system hang after displaying the Red Logo Screen?

Martin Sohnius (msohnius@novell.co.uk) explains:

After a little techie conference here in the "YES, Tested and Approved"
lab, we came to the following conclusion:

  At boot time, the original boot code performs the BIOS call to set
  up graphics mode.  The "Loading UnixWare" logo screen is displayed
  while the Unix kernel is loaded.  When the Unix kernel takes over,
  it switches the processor to 'protected mode' and among its first
  responsibilities is to switch the display back to VGA text.  It
  doesn't properly do this on all Pentium/PCI machines at this stage,
  presumably because it's now accessing hardware directly rather than
  through BIOS calls. 

  The good news is, that a work-around which we found for the
  installation can therefore be relied upon to work:

  When the red logo screen comes up during UnixWare installation (both
  on Boot Floppy 1 of 3 and later when it reboots after the final
  kernel has been built), IMMEDIATELY use the space bar to interrupt
  the boot process.  The logo screen will disappear, and you will be
  prompted 

	Enter the name of a kernel to boot:

  Simply hit <Enter> (meaning unix), and things will proceed.
  Switching out of graphics mode BEFORE unix is loaded, means that the
  the switch is performed via the BIOS call, and thus works.

  Once you have installed the system successfully, rename or remove
  the file /stand/image.


Subject: S24) Why do I get error messages saying "Arg list or environment too large"?

By default, UnixWare limits the total size of a command's argument list
to 5120 bytes - far too small a value.  I regularly ran up against this
limit trying to grep things in /usr/include/sys/*.h, myself.

You need to increase the ARG_MAX tunable kernel parameter to get around
this - see the FAQ on changing tunable parameters, and set ARG_MAX to 
something like 10240, or larger.

Subject: S25) How can I add more pseudo terminals under UnixWare?

Martin Sohnius (msohnius@novell.co.uk) is to be thanked for this FAQ
(in which I quote both the question and the answer verbatim - makes my
job easy! :-)

  To add more pseudo terminal devices (say, 32), perform the following
  steps as 'root':
 
  1)   Edit /etc/conf/mtune.d/io and increase the first value on the
        NSTREAM row by 32, but don't exceed 512.
 
  2)   Edit /etc/conf/sdevice.d/ptm and change the first numeric value
       from 16 to 32:
 
            ptm Y   16  0   0   0   0   0   0   0   -1

       to:
 
            ptm Y   32  0   0   0   0   0   0   0   -1
 
  3)   Similarly, edit the two files /etc/conf/sdevice.d/ptem and
       /etc/conf/sdevice.d/consem and change the first
       numeric value from 16 to 32.
 
  4)   Next you need to tell the system to create the proper device nodes
       when the kernel is rebooted.  To do this, create the following shell
       script /tmp/node.sh:
 
       for i in 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
       do
            echo "pts pts/$i    c    $i" >> /etc/conf/node.d/pts
       done
 
       Make sure that node.sh is executable (chmod 755 node.sh) then run
       it.  Also note the spacing between the strings within the quotes:
       between the strings 'pts' and 'pts' there is a space, between '$i'
       and 'c' there is a tab, and between c' and '$i' is also a tab.

       Look at the /etc/conf/node.d/pts file to see whether this succeeded.
 
       After you have run the scripts,
	   
  5)   Run /etc/conf/bin/idbuild -B to rebuild your kernel, then reboot.


Subject: S26) What command will correctly tell me the amount of memory in my UnixWare box?

Use the memsize command (/sbin/memsize or /etc/memsize), which
displays the kernel's concept of how much memory it has available.

/usr/sbin/prtconf, which gets memory information from the system BIOS,
is inaccurate above 16MB of installed memory.

Subject: S27) Why can't I do tape backups > 512MB after loading UnixWare 1.1?

This is a bug in the UnixWare 1.1 tape driver.  Martin Sohnius offers
the fix:

  Download the file /netwire/nsd/ptf126.tar from the server
  ftp.novell.com (note: you cannot scan the directory /netwire/nsd).
  Unpack the tar archive, run the ptf126.run script to create a diskette,
  and from it load the package ptf126 onto your machine.  This should
  fix the problem.


Subject: S28) How can I determine the serial number of my UnixWare installation?

The following will print out your UnixWare installation's serial
number:

  cat /etc/.snum


Subject: S29) How can I send print jobs to an HP printer with a JetDirect card?

The HP JetDirect cards include software that is installed on host
systems that are to send jobs to the printer.  Currently, UnixWare is
not among the supported platforms.

Newer versions of the JetDirect card support the lpd protocol,
however, allowing connection to UnixWare machines.  Simply set up the
printer as an ordinary remote, BSD-style printer.

For older versions, a connection of sorts can be made by opening a TCP
socket to port 9100 and dumping the data directly to the printer.

Subject: S30) How do I fix mail messages being flagged as From: smtp?

Paraphrased from an Andrew Josey (andrew@novell.co.uk) posting:

Add the following line to /etc/mail/mailcnfg:

  ADD_FROM=1

The ADD_FROM entry tells the smtp daemon to add a From: line to an
incoming mail message that does not already include one.  This ensures
a valid reply address to an incoming mail message.

To provide valid return addresses on outgoing mail, edit the smtp
entry in /etc/inetd.conf to read as follows:

  smtp stream tcp nowait smtp  /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/in.smtpd in.smtpd -r

The -r flag tells the smtp daemon not to rewrite the mail headers.
After making this change, send a hangup signal to inetd, or execute
the following commands:

  sacadm -k -p inetd
  sacadm -s -p inetd


Subject: S31) Why do I get errors when trying to pkgadd PCFS?

Someone hacked the pkginfo file, apparently unaware that pkgadd
checksums everything before installing it.  To fix this, after
extracting the tar archive, edit the file pcfs/pkgmap and replace the
line which says

  1 i pkginfo 216 18169 748905337

with

  1 i pkginfo 183 14284 748905337


Thanks to Martin Sohnius (msohnius@novell.co.uk) for this fix.

Subject: S32) Root can telnet/rlogin/etc, but ordinary users can't?
Subject: S33) What does the message "socket: Permission denied" mean?

UnixWare has, in addition to the standard file mode bits, a set of 
"file privileges" associated with executable files.  These privileges 
need to be properly set for executables, such as networking utilities,
to be able to access and use the resources necessary to accomplish
their task.

For some reason, the TCP/IP networking utilities are often installed
without their file privileges properly set.  To fix this, bring the
system down to single-user mode by logging in as root on the console
and executing the command

  shutdown -y -g0 -iS

Then enable the TCP/IP utilities' file privileges by executing
the command:

  /etc/inet/inet.priv -e

Then reboot the system

  shutdown -y -g0 -i6

and the TCP/IP utilties should work properly.

Subject: S34) How can I set up a printer for DOS/Windows users?

From System_Setup->Printer_Setup, add a printer called "doslp".

Type it as a "DOS Printer", no matter what it is, but set up the
  rest of the parameters just like normal.  This means that you'll
  probably not want to use this from within UNIX (although, more on
  that later), but strictly from DOS/Windows.  Well, that's why
  it's called "doslp".

From within DOS, this printer will be accessible as LPT1:

From within Windows, this printer will be accessible as LPT1.DOS.

One note about the doslp printer:  it essentially passes data through
unfiltered.  This means that if, like me, you've expected to be able
to send PostScript files off to a PostScript printer typed as PostScript
when set up within the UnixWare print system - and, like me, been quite
annoyed when the file is converted into mountains of plain text output
because you didn't specify a -T option (and is the correct -T option
"postscript", "Postscript", "PostScript", or just plain "PS"?) - you
might then find the doslp printer convenient.  Indeed, I have tested
it, and the following:

  lp -d doslp file.ps

does precisely what you'd expect.

Subject: S35) UnixWare install tells me there aren't 120MB free, but there's much more!

Probably it didn't recognize your host bus adapter (HBA), and hence
doesn't see a SCSI disk out there to install onto.  In that case,
you'll need an HBA diskette from your SCSI adapter vendor to supply to
the installation process when it asks for one.

Subject: S36) How can boot UnixWare/NT/OS2/etc all from the same hard drive?

Scott G. Hall (sgh@cbvox1.cb.att.com) has one possibility:

  There is a commercial product available to switch between operating
  systems that I suspect loads as the primary bootmanager for the
  harddisk.  The product is called "System Commander" from

  V Communications
  San Jose, CA
  800-648-8266
  (408-296-4224)

Check out their ad in Dr. Dobb's Journal, August '94, p.58, and an
apparent review in PC Magazine, May 31 '94 (per their ad).

Subject: S37) Can I use UnixWare with IDE drives larger than 528MB?

Terry Lambert (terry@cs.weber.edu) delivers the bad news:

The current IDE standard doesn't support > 528M -- period.

There *is* a new standard (ATA) that will.

There are also three other methods of pushing out the size; the first
is by stealing 2 unused bits to use a 12 bit (instead of 10 bit) cylinder
address.  This gives you 4096 cylinders instead of 1024.  The second
method is doing what UNIX does, and using sector offset addressing --
that is, use an absolute sector offset instead of a C/H/S address
(this is the one WD is pushing, but it means throwing away BIOS).  The
third and final method is by taking your two drive slots and *logically*
pretending that a 1G drive is two 528M drives (menaing you are now
limited to one drive).

Now the good news: with the exception of logically splitting the drive
into two drives, all these approaches mean new controller hardware, at
the least, or a new bus interface (meaning news controllers, cables,
and drives) at most.

So at least you get new hardware out of it.  8-(.

The probable reason UnixWare isn't supporting the 1G drive is that
it uses the logical drive splitting, and the idiots who manufactured
the controller were only interested in the DOS market, so they did the
tricks in BIOS using weird (non-ST506/WD interfaced) hardware, so it
would take a hardware driver to support the interface card.

Subject: S38) What are "PTF"s and where do I find them?

A PTF is a "Program Temporary Fix", aka, a patch.  The central
location for PTFs is:

ftp://ftp.novell.com/pub/netwire/nsd

Subject: S39) There's nothing in the PTF directory?!

The files are there, you just can't get a listing of them if you are
outside the Novell domain.  Darren Davis of Novell's Developer Support
organization explains:

We try to limit distribution of PTFs for a reason.  When a user calls
us about a bug in the system and this bug definately needs to be
fixed quickly, our CPR team (the team that generates PTFs) goes to work
and tries to implement a fix.  This fix has a short term development
cycle with a short term test cycle.  *NO* integration testing is
performed on PTFs, that is reserved for updates.  This means that
two PTF fixes could be hazardous if applied together.  It takes a lot
of integration testing to verify the interaction of the fixes involved.
So we try to remain involved in the configuration management of a
users machine to limit this potential problem with PTFs.  It is our
intention that PTFs are incorporated into updates which have had
full integration testing and then are generally distributed.

Users that do not observe our warning and get a hold of these PTFs,
or more specifically other files stored in /pub/netwire/nsd that
where meant to have a limited distribution are taking their machines
configuration and well being into their own hands, *BE WARNED*.

Maybe this analogy will help you understand the ramifications;

The directory /pub/netwire/nsd is like a pharmacy with the prescription
medications stored behind the counter.  Other medications are
provided over the counter (/pub/unixware directories).  The UnixWare
Support Engineers are like doctors who can prescribe a medication that
they understand to their patients (giving them file names).  Now we
believe that the doctors and pharmicists should fully understand the
implications of using a medication or its interaction with other
medications.  Using some medications or using them incorrectly
*CAN CAUSE DEATH*.  Mixing two medications that should not be mixed
also *CAN CAUSE DEATH*.  That is why we recommend patients to not
sneak behind the counter and take medications without advice from
their doctors.  When the FDA (The CPR and update team) approves a
drug for distribution it becomes an over the counter drug (updates).

Subject: S40) How do I install a package (like PTFs) that I've pulled off the net?

Someone (probably Martin Sohnius) posted the following advice:

Usual method:

For *most* ptf's, once you have un-tarred the stuff, you'll have a file
whose name ends in .txt, and possibly a read.me file.  Read those.  Then,
usually, there will be a file ending in *.run, and one or more other
files.  When you run the *.run script like this (as root):

  sh *.run

you'll be presented with a menu which includes "install now" (or similar)
as an option.

Exceptional method:

ptf130, and also some others like ptf619 (Kumar's video drivers), are
exceptions to this rule.  After un-tarring, there is no *.run file, only a
(big) file called ptf130.  This file is in "package stream format".  You
can verify this by the command

# hd ptf130 | head -2
0000	23 20 50 61 43 6b 41 67  45 20 44 61 54 61 53 74   # PaCkAgE DaTaSt
0010	52 65 41 6d 0a 70 74 66  31 33 30 20 31 20 39 35   ReAm.ptf130 1 95

Normally, you would copy this file to a diskette,

  cat ptf130 > /dev/rdsk/f0t

and you can then use 

  pkgadd -d diskette1

To load directly from the hard disk, do:

  pkgadd -d `pwd`/ptf130


Subject: S41) Why can't files larger than 8MB be created?

UnixWare by default sets a file size limit of 8MB, both via the kernel
tunable parameters SFSZLIM & the HFSZLIM (soft and hard file size limit,
respectively) and via the "ULIMIT=" line in /etc/default/login (the
default login profile file) or in a user's .profile (or .cshrc &c) file.

See the FAQ section on changing kernel tunables for information on how
to increase SFSZLIM and HFSZLIM; you can edit /etc/default/login or
~/.profile by hand.

Martin adds:

It's best to remember that the symbolic value "unlimited" will
always work.  Thus

  ULIMIT=unlimited

in /etc/default/login, and

  ulimit unlimited

from the command line. (BTW, that sets it to 7FFFFFFF, the biggest
signed long.)

Subject: S42) DOS won't run; says it's "Improperly installed".  Help?

If you're getting errors such as the following:

     % dos +x
     IMPROPER_INSTL: dos: ERROR: Improperly installed.
     Permission mode incorrect and/or ownership is wrong.

try the following advice from Martin Sohnius (msohnius@novell.co.uk):

/usr/bin/dos is a so-called "privileged file", and
*any* modification of its inode modification time such as by chmod or chgrp
or of its contents (such as adding a virus) will scupper the privileges.
As root, you *should* get:

  # filepriv /usr/bin/dos
  fixed     macupgrade,loadmod


If you don't get any privileges listed, do this:

  # grep /usr/bin/dos /etc/security/tcb/privs
  307512:39868:764947112:%fixed,loadmod,macupgrade:/usr/bin/dos
  # ls -l /usr/bin/dos
  -r-xr-xr-x   2 bin      sys       307512 Apr 28  1993 /usr/bin/dos
  # sum -r /usr/bin/dos
  39868   601 /usr/bin/dos

Then check that the first two fields of the entry in the privs file match the
size and checksum of your /usr/bin/dos -- we wouldn't want to catch a virus,
would we?  Then do:

  # filepriv -f macupgrade,loadmod /usr/bin/dos

Happily, there is a shell script (/usr/lib/merge/instdx.sh) that
automates the procedure of fixing the permissions on /usr/bin/dos.
Simply run this script as root to accomplish this task.  This shell
script only fixes /usr/bin/dos, however; it will not deal
with any other executables (DOS or otherwise) whose file privileges
have been munged somehow.

Subject: S43) What non-SCSI CD-ROMs are supported by UnixWare?

The following non-SCSI CD-ROM drives are supported by UnixWare 1.1 out
of the box:


* Sony CD 31A
* Sony CD 535
* Philips LMS CM205
* Philips LMS CM255


There are drivers on the ftp servers for the following devices:


* Mitsumi CRMC-LU005S [but not the FX]


jpltech@aol.com adds:

I recently used a Sony CDU-33A (follow-on to the 31)
with a SMS31083 controller to install UW PE 1.1.
The only problem was that the controller IO address had to be changed
from the factory defaults to what Unixware 1.1 wanted.

Subject: S44) How can I set/change the system owner?

See the man page for make-owner, which adds, deletes or transfers
ownership privileges for various usernames.  The executable is
/usr/X/adm/make-owner.

Thanks to Terry Lambert (terry@cs.weber.edu).

Subject: S45) Can I use my Mouse Systems mouse in 3-button mode?

No.  At least, not with the stock USL server.  You must use Mouse
Systems rodents in 2-button mode (flip the little switch on its
underbelly).

Some other (non-Novell) X servers might support the Mouse Systems
mouse in 3-button mode (one that I know of is the old Snitily server;
I don't know if the XInside servers carry forward this practice or
not).

I replaced the Mouse Systems device I got with my Mobius system (which
used to have the Snitily server on board) with a Logitech "First
Mouse".  This latter device does work in three-button mode, and is
very comfortable (IMO) to work with.  Your mileage may vary, of
course.

Subject: S46) Some files copied from UNIX to NetWare simply disappear.  What gives?

If you've copied files from the UNIX domain onto a NetWare server, and
some or all seem to have disappeared (as viewed from a DOS box), first
try listing the directory into which you've copied the files with the
NetWare "ndir" command.  You may find that the recently copied files
have the "System" and/or "Hidden" attribute set on the DOS side,
either of which causes the files to be invisible when viewed with an
unaided "dir" command.

The cause of this is the imperfect mapping of UNIX mode bits into
NetWare/DOS attributes.  Files with an "execute" mode bit set on the
UNIX side, for example, will have the "system" attribute set on the
DOS side.

To fix this, simply remove execute permissions on the UNIX side prior
to transferring the files.  Or, if the files have already been
transferred, use the DOS "attrib" command to remove the "System"
and/or "Hidden" attributes.

Subject: S47) What does /dev/dsk/c0t0d0s0 mean, anyway?

The two directories /dev/dsk and /dev/rdsk contain device
nodes for the block I/O drivers (suitable for mounting as filesystems)
and raw disk partitions, respectively.  The following chart, by Martin
Sohnius, explains the naming scheme of these device nodes:

  /dev/[r]dsk/c?t?d?s?
               ^ ^ ^ ^
               | | | |_____   slice number (0 - f)
               | | |
               | | |_______   logical unit number (almost always 0)
               | |
               | |_________   SCSI ID (for IDE drives: 0 or 1)	 
               |
               |___________   controller number (0 for primary -- boot)

In somewhat more detail:

* The controller number refers to the disk controller.  The
primary controller, off of which the system boots, is always zero.
Note that this numbering scheme encompasses both IDE and SCSI
controllers.
* The target number identifies the particular unit connected
to a disk controller.  For SCSI disks, the target number is the same
as the SCSI address of the disk.  For IDE drives, the target is 0 or
1, identifying the two possible drives on an IDE chain.
* The logical unit number distinguishes among multiple units
multiplexed onto a single SCSI or IDE target.  It is almost always 0,
specifying the first (and only) unit at that target.  (It may be used
to distinguish among multiple disks in a RAID configuration - can
anyone help the FAQ maintainer on this question?)
* The slice number identifies which of up to sixteen possible
disk slices is referred to.  In the case of the nodes in
/dev/dsk, these slices correspond to mountable filesystems.

Subject: S48) What does /dev/dsk/0s0 mean?

To simplify access to device nodes (which otherwise, by the
/dev/dsk/c?t?d?s? scheme, would require detailed knowledge of
disk layouts, the primary and secondary drives on a system are also
available via the nodes

  /dev/[r]dsk/[01]s[0-F]

Here the first number in the node name, always 0 or 1, identifies the
primary or secondary disk.  The second number identifies which slice
of up to fifteen is being referred to.  Hence, /dev/dsk/0s0
refers to the first slice on the primary disk, while /dev/dsk/1s0 
refers to the first slice on the secondary disk.

This naming scheme only covers the first two drives on the system,
subsequent disk drives must be accessed by the nodes
/dev/[r]dsk/c?t?d?s?.

Subject: S49) How can I restore file privileges after a cpio restore?

As many sysadmins have discovered, simply restoring files with their
original mode bits is not sufficient in UnixWare.  In addition to the
standard UNIX file access modes, UnixWare adds on certain file
"privileges" for enhanced security.  Unfortunately, these privileges
are not retained across a cpio backup and restore.

Greg Kable of Novell Sydney provides the following shell script, to be
run as root, to restore these privileges:

#!/bin/sh
sed 's/:/ /g' /etc/security/tcb/privs |
while read code1 code2 code3 privs file 
do 
filepriv echo "$privs" | sed -e s/%fixed,/ -f /' -e 's/%inher,/ -i /' $file 
done
_ttyoff

_faq(How can I get my Etherlink III (3C509) card to work?)

UnixWare 1.1s problems with the 3C509 card are legendary.  The root
cause seems to be the card's design, which use an I/O scheme that's
tight and fast and safe under DOS, but gives fits to multitasking
operating systems like UnixWare.  Not to put the entire blame on the
card, it also turns out that a slight deficiency in one part of the
UnixWare kernel's I/O system was outed by the 3C509.

At any rate, the following three-step program should get you back on
the right track with the Etherlink III:

* Bring your system up to version 1.1.2, by installing updates
1.1.2 and 1.1.1 as necessary.
* Apply patch ptf648.  This installs a new 3C509 driver.
* Apply patch ptf192.  This fixes the kernel I/O deficiency.


Subject: S50) Does UnixWare implement full NIS client capability?

Subject: D3) I installed the Prime Time SDK, and now I can't log in?!

Some permissions were not set properly by the SDK install for release 2-0.
The fix is to su to root and:

  chmod -R go+rx /usr/include
  chmod -R go+rx /usr/lib

There is a sticker on the CD-ROM envelope informing users of this
need, but it seems to have been accidentally left off of some early
shipments.  Steve Zwaska (stz@netcom.com) notes of these trials and
tribulations:

  There is a FTP site for the corrected Install scripts and make_links at 
  ftp.netcom.com  - pub/ptsdk/movers.uu

These problems have been fixed in release 2-1 of the PTSDK.

Subject: D4) Does UnixWare version 1.1 bundle Motif?

Yes.  Motif 1.2 runtime libraries and the Motif Window Manager are
included in UnixWare 1.1.

Subject: D5) How do I avoid problems programming with the UCB compatibility libraries?

There are two problems that are typically encountered when
compiling/linking code that uses Berklisms:

* Undefined symbols at link time
* Incompatibilities between the SysV header files and the UCB libraries

C code using Berklisms such as index/rindex will generate "undefined
symbol" messages for each of the BSD-specific functions.  To get
around this, you have one of two options:

* Option A: Straight UCB compile
   
   Compile with the "UCB" compiler (/usr/ucb/cc).  This is actually a shell
   script wrapper around the standard C compiler (/usr/ccs/bin/cc) that 
   sets up the necessary #include and library paths.  This is the path to
   take if you want a more "pure" BSD environment for your development.

* Option B: SysV compile with Berkeley extensions
   
   If you want a SysV environment, but need to link in some functions
   only available in the BSD library (eg, you'll replace gethostname() with
   uname() later), simply link in the UCB libraries _after_ the standard
   (SysV) libraries.  For example:

     cc -o foo foo.c -lc -L /usr/ucblib -lucb

   Note the order of the library specifications, and that "-lc" should
   precede the UCB library specification to resolve all possible synonyms
   against the SysV library, rather than the BSD library.

Be careful exercising option (b), however.  Merely linking against the
UCB library, without the preceding "-lc", will cause code to be
compiled against the SysV #include files (located in /usr/include) and
then linked against the UCB libraries:

    cc -o foo foo.c -L /usr/ucblib -lucb  # Don't do this

(Note that an implicit "-lc" is appended to the command line.)
Differences in such things as structure sizes between the SysV
#includes and the UCB libraries can wreak all kinds of havoc - as your
friendly FAQ maintainer discovered in just this fashion when trying to
use setjmp in a source module that also called some UCB functions.
One way to get around this is to insert a "-I /usr/ucbinclude"
directive into the command line, but this is essentially the effect of
using /usr/ucb/cc.

On this general topic, I'll include some notes from the net.

Gordon W. Ross <gwr@mc.com> observes:

  I just wanted to mention here that most people I have helped with
  porting problems related to the dirent or directory libraries have
  caused their own problems by incorrectly using the UCB library.
  The directory(3) routines in the UCB library only work with the
  header files in /usr/ucbinclude so if you fail to put that in
  your include path and just link with -lucb you end up with
  seriously broken programs.  The stuff in /usr/ucbinclude/ and
  /usr/ucblib/ was meant to be used by /usr/ucb/cc only, and
  when used that way it (mostly) works.  I have usually found it
  easiest to just stay away from the UCB library entirely.
  I would advise others to do the same.  (The UCB library has
  well known problems in signal and some dbm functions.)

Robert Withrow (witr@rwwa.com) adds:

  In addition, checking the following things will almost always yield a
  working port for any reasonably `well behaved program':

  1 Replace bcopy et.al with the apropriate memcpy functions...

  #define bcopy(b1,b2,len) memmove((b2), (b1), (size_t)(len))
  #define bzero(b,len) memset((b), 0, (size_t)(len))
  #define bcmp(b1,b2,len) memcmp((b1), (b2), (size_t)(len))

  2 Replace index and rindex approprately:

  #define index(a,b) strchr((a),(b))
  #define rindex(a,b) strrchr((a),(b))

  3 Don't use the SVR4 library's signal() routine,
  [use sigaction instead ...]

  /* Reliable signals */
  /* This was taken from Stevens... */

  #include <signal.h>

  typedef void Sigfunc(int);

  Sigfunc *signal(int signo, Sigfunc *func)
  {
    struct sigaction act, oact;

    act.sa_handler = func;
    sigemptyset(&act.sa_mask);
    act.sa_flags = 0;
    if (signo != SIGALRM) {
      act.sa_flags |= SA_ESTART;
    }
    if (sigaction(signo, &act, &oact) < 0)
      return(SIG_ERR);
    return(oact.sa_handler);
  }

  4 Replace random with lrand

  #define random() lrand48()
  #define srandom(seed) srand48((seed))

  5 Replace the bsd readdir code with the Posix code (requires changing an
  include file and a declaration usually, but also perhaps a symbol with a 
  strlen.)

  6 Replace wait3 and wait4 with posix wait code.  This is complicated
  because some code *writes* into the values that posix only provides read 
  access to.

Lest all this seem too dreadfully complicated, Rick Richardson
(rick@digibd.com) shrugs:

  Its much easier to port stuff than most people think.

  I've found that 99.99% of applications with BSDisms can be ported
  by simply compiling normally, but linking with -lc -lucb.  This
  resolves the SVR4 C library first, avoiding problems with dirent
  and the like, but also lets you pick up any BSD-isms like
  random(), index(), etc.

  Really, its painless.

Subject: D6) Where can I get Emacs?

An emacs 19.22 binary can be found at

  ftp.novell.de://pub/unixware/usle/BINARIES

A UnixWare 1.x binary is available as emacs-19.22.tar.gz, while a
version 2.0 binary is available as emacs-19.22.UW2.0.gz.  Note that
you will need the GNU program gunzip to uncompress these files.  This
is conveniently located in the same directory as gzip-1.2.4.tar.

The Prime Time SDK CD-ROM mentioned earlier also contains Emacs
(version 18.59.2).

Subject: D7) How can I compile X clients without a complete X11 source tree?

Pat Campbell of Novell USG writes:

  To compile most if not all X clients WITHOUT a complete X tree
  use: 
      imake -I/usr/X/lib/config -DUseInstalled
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      Not necessary if you have set IMAKEINCLUDE environment variable.

  The "-DUseInstalled" directs imake to use the installed include
  and library files. 

  Special note for motif applications:  

  You will need three more libraries, -lXm -lXIM -lgen, during 
  the link stage.  I prepend them to the following variables
  within the Imakefile like this.

               LOCAL_LIBRARIES = -lXm -lXIM [ whatever was already here ]
               SYS_LIBRARIES = -lgen [ whatever was already here ] 

  This is a working solution, not necessarily the correct/elegant solution :-)

Subject: D8) I've now got 1.1.  Where's my SDK?

The UnixWare software development kit (SDK) ships separately from the
base UnixWare operating system.

Subject: D9) I've now got the 1.1 SDK.  Where's xab?

xab (X Application Builder) has been removed from the SDK distribution
as of release 1.1.  It is still available from Integrated Computer
Solutions (1-800-800-4271), however.

xab _was_ contained in its own package, however, thus you might try
pkgadd'ing to to a 1.1 system.  Be forewarned, however, that this is
NOT SUPPORTED by Novell.  Also, the xab in the 1.0 release is a MoOLIT
version; one will have to go to ICS for the pure Motif version.

Subject: D10) What library do I need for XmbTextListToTextProperty [&c]?

Link with -lXIM if you are getting "Undefined symbol" errors on
XmbTextListToTextProperty or XmbTextPropertyToTextList.

Subject: D11) How about regcmp and regex?

Add -lgen to your link list.

Subject: D12) I get major errors compiling tin.  What gives?

This should by now be a classic problem in compiling tin under
UnixWare (1.0 at least, I don't know if 1.1 fixed this particular
bug).

If you're trying to compile tin, and the make chokes on the first
source file with messages like the following:

"/usr/include/sys/termios.h", line 503: (struct) tag redeclared: winsize
active.c, line 615: warning: argument is incompatible with prototype: arg #4
active.c, line 616: warning: argument is incompatible with prototype: arg #4
make: fatal error.

then you've been bitten by a known bug in one of the UnixWare system
header files.  You can do one of two things to compile tin under
UnixWare:

* Fix the header file.  Change all occurrences of

    _IO_PT_PTEM_H

   to

    _IO_PTEM_H

   in the file /usr/include/sys/ptem.h.

<or>

* Hack the tin header file tin.h, which is what I did.  At line 130 in 
   tin.h, you'll find two #include directives, <sys/ptem.h> and 
   <sys/tty.h>.  Place the following #define between these two #includes:

    #define _IO_PTEM_H

   This works around the problem with the system header files, if you're
   not excited about modifying them (or don't have su privileges).

Subject: D14) Why do I get "Undefined symbols" when compiling socket applications?

System V doesn't include the socket libraries in libc, as does Berklix.
Add the following two libraries to your libraries list in the link
command line:

  -lsocket -lnsl

Subject: D15) In what library is <undefined symbol> defined?

Beyond socket libraries, if you're getting undefined symbols at link
time and are stumped as to why, try the following shell script:

--- Cut here and save to "who_defines", then "chmod +x who_defines"---
#!/bin/sh
if [ $# -ne 1 ]
then
        echo "Usage: who_defines function_name" >&2
        exit 1
fi
 
# You may need to add library directories to this list.
 
LIBDIRS="
        /usr/lib
        /usr/ccs/lib
        /usr/X/lib
        /usr/ucblib"
 
for dir in $LIBDIRS
do
        for lib in $dir/*.a $dir/*.so
        do
                if [ -r "$lib" ]
                then 
                        nm -px $lib | sed -n '/T \<'$1'\>/p' 2>/dev/null |
                        while read ans
                        do
                                echo $lib:$ans
                        done
                fi
        done
done
--- End of "who_defines" ---


To determine where a symbol (eg, bind) is defined:

  % who_defines bind
  /usr/lib/libsocket.a:0x000000c0 T bind
  /usr/lib/libsocket.so:0x00008050 T bind

Note that, as above, you will often get multiple answers.  Here, we
see that bind itself is in the socket directory (the .a and .so are
the static and dynamic libraries, respectively).  The library name is
the path that precedes the colon; your ld command line should thus
include the entry:

  -lsocket

Subject: D16) Why does my linker die with memory errors when building <large executable>?

Linking large objects requires some resources beyond this configured into
the basic UnixWare kernel.  You need to increase the following tunables.

	SDATLIM
	HDATLIM
	SSTKLIM
	HSTKLIM
	SVMMLIM
	HVMMLIM

See the FAQ on changing kernel tunable parameters for further information.


Subject: D17) Why does the configure script hang when building Emacs 19.xx?

David Spencer (spencer@panix.com) explains:

  The UnixWare cc doesn't parse the emacs configure script correctly, 
  and passes the wrong dope to the preprocessor.  You have three
  options:

* Use gcc. gcc understands the configure file. gcc builds easily
  under UW.  Don"t use the gnu binutils, just gcc.

* Use the UnixWare preprocessor directly. Somebody know how to do
  this? It"s in some readme file somewhere, I think.

* Get the emacs binary as indicated in the FAQ.


Subject: D18) "man" denies knowing about many Standard C functions.  What gives?

Kevin Brannen (kbrannen@metronet.com) has become UnixWare's "Master of
Man Pages":

First, make sure you've gone thru the "Guide to Fixing Man".
(I've sent Martin a note asking him to talk to Andrew Josey about
putting my "Guide to Fixing Man" on the mail-server there at
novell.co.uk.)

Now do "apropos command" or "man -k command", you should see the
topic to do a man on.  For example, "man strchr" returns:

   No manual entry for strchr.

So do "apropos strchr", which returns:

   string: strcat, strncat, strcmp, strncmp, strcpy,  strncpy, strdup,
   strlen,  strchr, strrchr, strpbrk, strspn, strcspn, strtok,
   strstr (3C) -  string operations

which tells you that you should do "man 3c string".  Famous groupings
that hide a lot of functions but which have no corresponding function are:
string, memory, directory, trig,
and exec.

Subject: D19) Where can I get C++ for UnixWare?

The following was lifted directly from a Novell announcement:

The C++ Compilation System 2.0 for UnixWare 1.1 is available for the
suggested retail price of U.S. $99 in CD ROM and QIC-24 tape formats.
To order in the U.S. or Canada, call 1-800-457-1767 or fax (317)
364-8888.  Outside North America call, +31-55-384279 or fax
+31-55-434455.
