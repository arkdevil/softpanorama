converts a set of files into a single file. This single "file
<BR>
archive" is smaller than the sum of the original files, since data
<BR>
compression is used. LH/2 can later be used to extract the files in
<BR>
their original form.
<BR>

<BR>
Since the "file archive" created by LH/2 stores related files in a
<BR>
single package, it is particularly well suited for transferring files
<BR>
through a modem. This will ensure that all necessary files are
<BR>
included, and that none were forgotten. Since LH/2 keeps a "check
<BR>
sum", it will also verify that the files were received correctly. As
<BR>
an added bonus, since the files are compressed, it will take less
<BR>
time to send the file.
<BR>

<BR>
If the person on the receiving end does not have LH/2, the person
<BR>
sending may choose to turn the archive into a "self-extracting"
<BR>
executable program.
