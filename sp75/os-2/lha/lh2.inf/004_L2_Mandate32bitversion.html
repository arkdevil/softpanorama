 - Maintain the lh/2 tradition of an easy to use,  free,  public domain

<BR>
  file format based archiver for OS/2.  One of the reasons I wrote
<BR>
  LH-ANSIC in the first place was because ARC/PAK/ZIP/ZOO/LHA were too
<BR>
  complicated. I have resisted adding not-completely-necessary features

<BR>
  in order to keep the "syntax screen" very small.
<BR>

<BR>
  Despite the drastic internal changes to LH/2,  I am very pleased to
<BR>
  report that I only added one command line switch (/E).
<BR>

<BR>
 - All commercial restrictions have been lifted with the 2.20 release.
<BR>
  Although A:WARE Inc. still owns the source code, the executable will
<BR>
  be completely public domain.  Any person or company can use it for
<BR>
  internal use,  software installation or distribution, backup, etc.
<BR>

<BR>
  I may soon,  however,  sell a "compression kit" for those companies
<BR>
  that insist on having source code,  or that want to build compression

<BR>
  into their own OS/2 software installation/distribution programs.
