 - will not abort when it can't open a file,  such as SWAPPER.DAT, when

<BR>
  compressing.
<BR>

<BR>
 - When compressing, /A (store file attributes (system, hidden,
<BR>
  readably)) was unpredictable if the current dir was not the root dir.
<BR>
  Fixed.
<BR>

<BR>
 - LH/2 now supports the maximum OS/2 path length:  260 bytes.
<BR>

<BR>
  As was documented,  because of the design of the original *.LZH file
<BR>
  header, LH/2 v2.14 could only handle file names that were 74 bytes or

<BR>
  less. Unfortunately,  LH/2 did not enforce this.  If you saved a file

<BR>
  &gt; 74 bytes,  the header "overflowed" into the file's data, destroying

<BR>
  any chances of extracting the file.  This only burned one person, to
<BR>
  my knowledge (sorry Scott!).  That incident just happened a few weeks

<BR>
  ago, and is what got me working on LH/2 again!
<BR>

<BR>
  Long file names (&gt; 64 bytes) are now stored differently.  They are

<BR>
  stored in an "extended header";  a feature that was new to LHA 2.00
<BR>
  (LHA is the dos program that LH/2 grew from).
