This program is based on the LZH (Lempel-Ziv-Huffman) compression
<BR>
method developed by Haruhiko Okumura and Haruyasu Yoshizaki. The
<BR>
compression routines were derived from the uncopyrighted LZHUF.C,
<BR>
posted by Haruhiko Okumura.
<BR>

<BR>
The file format (*.lzh) is compatible with LHARC, the MSDOS archiver
<BR>
by Haruyasu Yoshizaki. The format of LHARC files was learned from
<BR>
the public domain LHX.H (LHX is a *.lzh file repair utility) by Mark
<BR>
Armbrust.
