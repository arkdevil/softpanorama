The following procedure has worked well during testing.  Use at your own

<BR>
risk.
<BR>

<BR>
 - To backup your OS/2 2.0 desktop,  use the following command,  from the

<BR>
  root directory of your boot drive (this is for HPFS!):
<BR>

<PRE>   lh a desktop.lzh \os2\os2.ini \os2\os2sys.ini "os!2 2.0 desktop\*" /se
</PRE>
  You CAN run this while OS/2 is running -- however,  try not to run
<BR>
  any other programs or move anything on the desktop while this is
<BR>
  running.  You're best to run it from a Full Screen command prompt.
<BR>

<BR>
  To restore your desktop,  you will have to boot from another disk and

<BR>
  run (from the ROOT dir):
<BR>
  
<PRE>lh x desktop.lzh /se</PRE>
