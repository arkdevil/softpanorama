<U><I>LH/2 V2.19 32 bit beta.  92/12/17</I></U>
<BR>

<BR>
Pre-Release 32 bit beta.  Program history for this release will be covered

<BR>
under 'New Features' etc.
<BR>

<BR>
<U><I>LH 2.14 Mon  03-30-1992</I></U>
<BR>

<BR>
Wow;  two releases in the same month.  Bending to popular demand (all
<BR>
two of you!),  Lh2 will now preserve case.  LH2 is still case
<BR>
insensitive when searching for files however.
<BR>

<BR>
In compatability mode (/c),  file names are stored in upper case.
<BR>

<BR>
<U><I>LH 2.13 Tue  03-10-1992</I></U>
<BR>

<BR>
So solve a few problems with it's interaction with Squish,  LH will
<BR>
now exit with a non-zero ERRORLEVEL if:
<BR>

<BR>
  1) No files are extracted.
<BR>
  2) An invalid LZH header is encountered.
<BR>

<BR>
Archives with -lh4- type files are now supported (for decompression) by

<BR>
using the -lh5- code,  which seems to work fine.
<BR>

<BR>
A new option: /m.  This will cause only files with their archive bits
<BR>
set to be stored (during an ADD or MOVE operation).  The archive bit is

<BR>
reset if all goes well.
<BR>

<BR>
<U><I>LH 2.12</I></U>
<BR>

<BR>
During compression,  LH 2.12 will recognize that there is no space left

<BR>
on a disk for '-lh5-' compression.  (It always worked correctly for
<BR>
-lh1-).
<BR>

<BR>
If a file with an unknown stowage is encountered,  LH 2.12 will no
<BR>
longer stop at a prompt if the /o option is specified.
<BR>

<BR>
<U><I>Wed  05-22-1991</I></U>
<BR>

<BR>
Version 2.11 is a very small bug fix.  When Adding/Moving files,
<BR>
LH.EXE will now correctly exit with an ERROREVEL of 0 if successful.

<BR>

<BR>
Welcome to version 2.00 of LH2.  The last version that most of you
<BR>
had access to was 0.80.  I've jumped all the way to 2.00 so that an
<BR>
association can be made with LHA 2.x,  the DOS program which LH2 is
<BR>
a clone of.  With 0.80,  I thought LH2 was "functionally stable";
<BR>
But then Haruhiko Okumura had to go and create a better compression
<BR>
algorithm!  This new version, 2.00,  supports that new compression
<BR>
method and has a few other small changes as well.
<BR>

<BR>
Notes:
<BR>

<BR>
 o This new version is (on many files) faster than the old version
<BR>
  while compressing.  It is always faster at decompression (2 to
<BR>
  3 times faster).  Files that contain many repeated bytes/strings
<BR>
  (such as text files) compress the fastest (almost as fast as Zip
<BR>
  imploding).  Files that are more<!-- entering slot 5 --> random compress
slower;  a very
<BR>
  large and very random file may compress slower than the old
<BR>
  version of LH.
<BR>

<BR>
 o It is coded all in C, and is therefore slower than Yoshi's DOS
<BR>
  version (LHA.EXE) which is coded in mostly assembly.  My tests
<BR>
  show LH2 to be a little more than 1/2 the speed while
<BR>
  compressing, and about 2/3 the speed at decompressing.  I can
<BR>
  live with it.
<BR>

<BR>
 o /c causes LH2 to use the old -lh1- compression method that prior
<BR>
  versions of LH2, and LHARC 1.x, used.
<BR>

<BR>
 o the new 'D' command erases files from an *.lzh archive.
<BR>

<BR>
 o When extracting files from an archive,  the disk space for the
<BR>
  destination file is allocated at the time the file is opened.
<BR>
  This ensures that as little fragmentation as possible will occur
<BR>
  on the file.
<BR>

<BR>
 o Specifying a drive with no directory (LH A FOO.LZH C:*.*) will
<BR>
  use the root directory,  rather than the current directory on
<BR>
  that drive.  Fixed.
<BR>

<BR>
 o The size of LH.EXE has grown quite a bit (from 38k to 48k) since
<BR>
  it now has to support both the old and new
<BR>
  compression/decompression code.
<BR>

<BR>
 o I've moved.  My new phone number is near the bottom of this
<BR>
  document.  I've also added a disclaimer there.
<BR>

<BR>
 o The new compression code (for -lh5- compression) was lifted from
<BR>
  AR02.LZH,  by Haruhiko Okumura.  Thanks once again Haruhiko!  I
<BR>
  can't make heads or tails of Yoshi's code.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
<U><I>LH2.DOC, Mon  03-11-1991</I></U>
<BR>
Version 1.00 fixes a small bug:  If you tried to L)ist the contents
<BR>
of an *.lzh file that did not exist,  no error message was printed.
<BR>

<BR>
<U><I>LH2.DOC, Tue  01-08-1991</I></U>
<BR>

<BR>
This version, 0.80,  is the first release that supports EAs
<BR>
(Extended Attributes) and (to some degree) 'long' file names.  If
<BR>
there are no problems with it,  it will be renamed 1.00 and
<BR>
forgotten about.
<BR>

<BR>
EAs are supported in the following manner.  During the file search
<BR>
stage (where LH creates a list of all matching files to be sorted),
<BR>
a pseudo-archive named EA.LZH is created,  if needed.  Using the
<BR>
same names as the original files,  EA.LZH contains the associated
<BR>
extended attributes.  EA.LZH is placed in the archive along with the
<BR>
other files.  Therefore,  anyone who does not have this version of
<BR>
LH2 can still apply the EAs to their respective files by using the
<BR>
OS/2 EAUTIL.EXE file.  A file named '!readme.ea' is imbedded in
<BR>
EA.LZH,  which supplies instructions to achieve this.
<BR>

<BR>
If you use this version of LH2 to extract archives (and do not use
<BR>
the /i switch),  EA.LZH will be<!-- entering slot 6 --> extracted automatically
and applied
<BR>
to the files,  then erased.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Notes:
<BR>

<BR>
  o This version,  and future versions,  require OS/2 1.20 or newer.
<BR>

<BR>
  o Wildcards should work just like 1.20 wildcards.  (Let me know
<BR>
   if you find an inconsistency).
<BR>

<BR>
  o t = test option is new.
<BR>

<BR>
  o /i.  This option causes EAs not to be stored for the Add and
<BR>
   Move commands.  When used with the eXtract command, /i causes
<BR>
   EA.LZH to be extracted,  but not applied or erased.
<BR>

<BR>
  o LH2 does not support directory EAs,  only file EAs.
<BR>

<BR>
  o do NOT update an lzh file that was already stored with EAs
<BR>
   (since ea.lzh will already be in the lzh file).
<BR>

<BR>
  o The EAs are applied after ALL of the files have been extracted.
<BR>
   A side effect: If you do not extract a file that has an EA,  by
<BR>
   answering 'n' to the "File '&lt;file&gt;' already exists. Overwrite?"
<BR>
   prompt,  the EA WILL STILL BE JOINED to the old file on your
<BR>
   disk.
<BR>

<BR>
  o Longnames are supported -- sort of.  The total length of a file
<BR>
   name (including path) must be less than or equal to 74 bytes.
<BR>
   Longnames are stored without modification in the lzh header,
<BR>
   therefore they will fail to extract on a FAT partition and/or
<BR>
   under DOS. Therefore, the onus is on the user to enforce normal
<BR>
   (8.3) file names,  so as not to inconvenience other users. It is
<BR>
   HIGHLY recommended that you don't use longnames in files you
<BR>
   upload to BBS's.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
<U><I>LH2.DOC, Tue  03-06-1990</I></U>
<BR>

<BR>
LH2 is an OS/2 clone of the MSDOS program LHARC.
<BR>

<BR>
It is based on the source code I released as "LH-ANSIC.LZH",  the
<BR>
ansi-c version of a simplified LHARC compatible compressor/decompressor.
<BR>
This program is the same as LH-ANSIC.LZH,  with the following exceptions:
<BR>

<BR>
 o The Move command has been added.  (ADD files, then erase them).
<BR>

<BR>
 o Wildcards are supported from the command line during an ADD/MOVE
<BR>
  function.
<BR>

<BR>
 o The /s command will cause LH2 to "walk" down directory trees.
<BR>

<BR>
For a complete list of functions, run LH.EXE without any arguments.
<BR>

<BR>
NOTE: OS/2 1.20's long file names and EAs are *NOT* supported in
<BR>
this release.  This would make the program incompatible with the
<BR>
original LHARC.  I may change this in the near future though.
<BR>

<BR>
Trying to "BIND" this program will cause unpredictable results when
<BR>
run in DOS mode.  (DosFindFirst()/Next() can not be supported in DOS
<BR>
mode if used recursively).
