PARTITION MAGIC FOR OS/2
<P>
PowerQuest, the File System Experts, began shipping PartitionMagic for OS/2
just last month, and already it is one of the best selling OS/2 applications
in the market!
<P>
PartitionMagic for OS/2, the one and only software utility that permits
users to visually shrink, expand, move and convert their hard disk partitions,
is now shipping.  OS/2 Warp users who used the easy install option were
forced to accept the FAT file system. PartitionMagic is the only product
available that allows these OS/2 users to automatically convert their FAT
partitions to OS/2's High Performance File System.
<P>
Just as modular partitions revolutionized the flexibility and efficiency
of modern office buildings, PartitionMagic will revolutionize the way people
use their hard disks, said Eric Ruff, PowerQuest's founder and president.
 Before PartitionMagic, modifying partitions on a hard drive was like knocking
down and rebuilding permanent walls in an office building or a factory said
Ruff.  First you had to back up everything on your hard disk.  Next you
had to delete the partition.  Then you had to create and format a new partition.
 If the partition had an operating system you had to reinstall it.  Finally,
you had to restore all of the data that you had backed up.  If you made
any mistakes or wanted another partition you had to repeat the entire process.
 Today, with PartitionMagic, computer users can visually move, shrink, expand
and convert their partitions in seconds.
<P>
Most computer users view their system partitions the way they view the walls
of their homes.  If a partition is too small or too big they simply live
with it.  For example, many OS/2 Warp users are using FAT partitions and
the Dual Boot option of OS/2 because it's the easiest way to install OS/2.
 Many of these users would prefer to use HPFS and/or OS/2's Boot Manager.
 PartitionMagic makes it very easy to create room for a Boot Manager partition
and automatically converts FAT partitions to HPFS.
<P>
OS/2 users are not the only ones who can benefit by using PartitionMagic.
 For example, a Microsoft technical note that describes how to create a
new partition to upgrade from DOS 6.0 to DOS 6.2 is eight pages long.  A
PartitionMagic customer can be finished modifying the partition in the time
it takes to read the first paragraph of the technical note.  PartitionMagic
also makes it easy to consolidate free space that is split between two or
more partitions into a single, more useable location. 
<P>
 "PowerQuest's early customers are advanced users that recognize the immediate
benefits of dynamic partition management."  said John Christensen, V.P.
of Marketing.  "This market includes software developers, system administrators,
technical support staff, VAR's and system integrators.  There is tremendous
pent up demand in this market for the functionality provided by PartitionMagic.
 Eventually PartitionMagic will be a mandatory utility for anyone who<!-- entering slot 128 --> wants
total control of their hard disk."
<P>
Founded in March 1993 by Eric Ruff, author of QDOS, Backit and Optune, PowerQuest
is a privately held corporation located in Orem, Utah.  PartitionMagic for
OS/2 retails for $129.95 (U.S.).

NEW OS/2 STRATEGY GAME - MATRIX 1.1 - FOR OS/2 2.x &amp; WARP
<P>
Matrix is a new OS/2 PM strategy shareware game released by CodeSmith Software.
 The game is easy to learn - like Tetris - but requires some brains - like
Go. Matrix uses a set of colored tiles, where each player attempts to score
by matching tile colors.  The game is played with two players, with the
opponent being either computer (different levels) or human.  To appeal to
as many players as possible, the game is fully configurable.  Board configuration
includes size of board and the background displayed - either a selected
color or any bitmap.  The shape and color of the playing tiles can also
be selected, making the game suitable for users with monochrome screens
or those that have trouble distinguishing shapes or colors.
<P>
Matrix is simple to install, and fully functional even if unregistered.
 Matrix is a non-destructive game - it will not make changes to CONFIG.SYS
or the system/user INI files, nor does it use of any hidden files.
<P>
Here's what PCA Dave (a sysop at America Online) has to say:
<P>
<I>"This puppy can be quite addicting.  I had a lot of fun playing around
with it last night!  I definitely like the customizing features, especially
being able to load alternate bitmaps for the background."</I>
<P>
System Requirements for Matrix are:  OS/2 2.0 or later, 210K of free disk
space.
<P>
Matrix registration cost is only $12 (U.S) and the game is available at
most OS/2 FTP and BBS<!-- entering slot 129 --> sites, as well as CompuServe
and America Online.  The file name is MATRIX11.ZIP, with latest versions
