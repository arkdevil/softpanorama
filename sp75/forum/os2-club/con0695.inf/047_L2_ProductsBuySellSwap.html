<BR>
The most comprehensive development environment in the world.
<BR>
<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="047_L2_ProductsBuySellSwap_9.gif" WIDTH=0 HEIGHT=0 ALIGN=center>
<P>
The "PRIDE" INFORMATION FACTORY goes beyond software engineering; beyond
client/server computing; beyond object oriented programming; and beyond
BPR.  The FACTORY provides an organized roadmap and tools for planning,
designing, developing and implementing enterprise-wide systems.
<P>
The centerpiece of the FACTORY software is a Repository used to share and
integrate information resources, including systems, data, and business components.
 It offers an open architecture providing the means to interface the FACTORY
with your favorite application development aids.  Ultimately, the FACTORY
improves productivity by bringing order out of a chaotic and disjointed
development environment.
<P>
The FACTORY includes methodologies and tools for:  Systems Modeling, Enterprise
Modeling, Data Base Modeling, Object Modeling, and Project Management.
<P>
The FACTORY is implemented using IBM's OS/2, offering a true 32-bit development
platform with multitasking, multithreading, and virtual memory.  Product
is CUA compliant and supports the DBCS.  For additional information, reference

<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Submit and execute batch jobs (OS/2 or DOS Command

</UL>
<P>
<LI>BATCH MANAGER" is ideal for any batch process; e.g., backing-up files,
downloading data from a mainframe, updating files, payroll, or producing
routine reports.  The product is executed at each workstation and the jobs
are controlled by the individual user.
<P>
The product is sold as a one-time license for use on a single OS/2 computer
workstation at $150 (U.S.) per workstation.  A 90 day warranty accompanies
the product.  Corporate licensing agreements are also available; contact
the vendor for details.  BATCH MANAGER requires IBM's OS/2, version 2.1
or higher.
<P>
<I>"I would recommend Batch Manager for anyone who has the need to initiate
jobs on a delayed basis.  Batch Manager provides the type of capability
that has existed for<!-- entering slot 145 --> two decades on the mainframe
and mini-computer platforms.  As such, it would also be a good tool for
those contemplating the right-sizing of mainframe and minicomputer applications
to the PC/LAN platform."</I> - Ron Beauchemin, OS/2 MONTHLY Call or write

THE AUTHORITATIVE GUIDE FOR INFORMATION RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (IRM)
<BR>
<!-- Unable to decode bitmap format --><IMG SRC="047_L2_ProductsBuySellSwap_12.gif" WIDTH=0 HEIGHT=0 ALIGN=center><B>THE
IRM REVOLUTION:  BLUEPRINT FOR THE 21ST CENTURY</B>

MBA Press

ISBN 0-9621189-0-7; 265 pages
<BR>

<P>
Information Resource Management (IRM) represents an imaginative new way
of thinking and conducting business in the information age.  It is not just
another way of using computers.  Rather, it is concerned with the development
and control of all the resources required to produce information.  To many,
IRM will represent a radical departure from the mainstream of thinking in
today's data processing world which is generally technology oriented.  The
purpose of this book is to convey to executives a practical approach for
the design and development of information resources consistent with their
business objectives.  Ultimately, the IRM approach demystifies the information
systems development process and puts control back in the hands of executive
management where it belongs.
