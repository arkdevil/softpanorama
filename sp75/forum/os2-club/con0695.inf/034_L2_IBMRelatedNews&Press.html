OS/2 WARP WINS SEVEN INDUSTRY AWARDS IN MARCH
<P>
<B>InfoWorld Product of the Year</B>
<P>
The readers of<I> InfoWorld</I> selected OS/2 Warp as their choice for Overall
1994 Product of the Year.  Capturing this award for the third consecutive
year, OS/2 continues to outshine the competition in the 32-bit desktop operating
system arena.  Earlier in March, OS/2 Warp received five awards at CeBIT
in Hannover, Germany, and received the Software Publishers Association's
"Codie" for Best Business Software.  In all, OS/2 has won 56 major industry
awards since version 2.0 shipped.
<P>
<B>Five Awards at CeBIT</B>
<P>
At CeBIT, the world's largest computer trade show,<I> PC Professional Magazine
</I>gave OS/2 Warp its Innovation of the Year award in recognition of creative
concepts and revolutionary technology. <I> CHIP Magazine</I> and DOS International
named OS/2 Warp the Operating System of the Year;<I> 1+1 Magazine</I> recognized
Warp with a Software Marketing Quality award; and a fifth award for Design
Excellence from the Industrie Forum honored Warp's user interface.
<P>
<B>SPA Best Business Software Award</B>
<P>
At the SPA's Excellence in Software awards ceremony, OS/2 Warp was named
product of the year out of over 700 nominees and six finalists in the business
software category.  The other finalists were Collabra Share, Lotus Approach,
Lotus SmartSuite for Windows, Microsoft Office Professional, QuickXpense,
and Laplink for Windows. In their tenth year, the Codie Awards are the software
industry's highest honor for outstanding product achievement.

LAN SERVER 4.0 NAMED 1995 DEPARTMENTAL NOS OF YEAR
<P>
IBM's OS/2 LAN Server 4.0 earned another major award at the industry's biggest
networking show, NetWorld+Interop, when<I> LAN Magazine</I> named it 1995
Departmental Network Operating System of the Year.
<P>
"With a well-placed one-two punch, LAN Server from IBM entered the fray,"
reported the magazine. "Available in two versions, Entry and Advanced, the
product has already turned more than a few heads."
<P>
<B>Second Major Honor</B>
<P>
The award, for the Entry version, is the second major honor for LAN Server
4.0 since its September debut at NetWorld+Interop in Atlanta, where it won
the Data Communications/LAN Times Best of Show trophy.
<P>
In announcing the Departmental NOS of the Year award,<I> LAN Magazine</I> said
easy graphical installation and centralized administration were among the
features that moved LAN Server ahead of the competition.
<P>
"The real muscle in this new release is its object-oriented, drag-and-drop
GUI.  Installation has been streamlined with a self-configuring setup option
for standard environments and a customized configuration option.  IBM also
added a single logon and centralized administration for easy management,"
<I>LAN Magazine</I> said.
<P>
Other features cited as particularly beneficial to<!-- entering slot 119 --> departmental
customers were LAN Server's integrated TCP/IP for multiprotocol support,
the ability of administrators to restrict the disk space available to specific
users, and the potential cost savings because the product does not require
a dedicated server.
<P>
"LAN Server 4.0-Entry is the ideal network operating system for small companies
and workgroups.  It is generally available for under 550 USD and offers
great performance and a broad range of powerful features," said Phil Powers,
director of LAN Systems Marketing, IBM Personal Software Products.
