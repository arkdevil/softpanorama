It's amazing the break-neck speed of developments in OS/2.  No sooner had
we put the May issue to bed and distributed it that we received our first
few changes.  I see this as a testament to the dynamic world of OS/2.
<P>
First,<I> OS/2 CONNECT</I> keeps expanding.  Since the maiden issue in April
we've received E-Mail correspondence from OS/2 users in Australia, Belgium,
Canada, Denmark, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United
Kingdom, and throughout the United States.  Your input is important to us
and we appreciate your correspondence.
<P>
Also, we've finally found places to upload the newsletter on the Internet.
 You can now find<I> OS/2 CONNECT</I> on the following Internet sites:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

THE COMDEX EXPERIENCE
<BR>
<I>"Have you ever been experienced?
<BR>
Well, I have."</I>

It's been three years since I was at Comdex.  The last time was in Chicago
where IBM was rolling out OS/2 version 2.0.  I was attending as an exhibitor
demonstrating our OS/2 based products.  Now, I was returning as a member
of the press corps, a new role for me, yet one I adapted to quickly.  As
a member of the press, I discovered all of the little perks that reporters
and editors enjoy, such as:  the press room, a media center where I could
obtain all of the latest press releases, a break-out room with refreshments
to relax and chat, and access to all of the presentations.  It's interesting
to see how attentive the exhibitors and presenters are when you're wearing
a red press badge.
<P>
I'm always amazed at the scope of the computer industry and to see how it
keeps growing and changing.  Three years ago I was in awe of the scope of
Comdex which filled up McCormick Place.  I didn't think the show could get
much bigger.  Boy was I wrong<!-- entering slot 16 --> !  This year's Comdex,
held at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta, dwarfed the Chicago
conference and took up nearly every inch of the available 950,000 square
feet.  It was the largest Microsoft flea market I had ever seen.
<P>
Microsoft came out with its marketing guns blazing and used this Comdex
to tout its Windows 95, the latest entry in the 32-bit operating systems
wars.  It was hard to miss a sign either saying "Building for Windows 95"
or "Where do you want to go tomorrow?"  Demonstrations of the beta version
of Windows 95 were everywhere and I was surprised to see the public's reaction
to it; somewhere between lukewarm and cold.
<P>
On the surface there have been many cosmetic changes made to Windows 95
to make it look like OS/2.  But the similarities end there.  I noticed the
demonstrators were trained to tactfully dodge running multiple apps at the
same time, in fear that multitasking might lock-up the computer.  There
were several other things that made me suspicious of the operating system;
for example:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Files can now have names up to 244 characters
long.  Yet, when you check on the "properties" of the file, you see the
archaic 8.3 naming convention still in place.  To illustrate, suppose you
name a file, "This is my file for this and that"; the operating system takes
the first few letters of the file name and adds a numeric to uniquely identify
it.  In reality, the file's name is "This_i01.txt".  This means the clunky
Windows FAT file management system is still used in Windows 95.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Windows 95 claims to be "object oriented" yet
you cannot make shadows of objects as you can under OS/2, nor search for
the parents or children of files.  Instead, files are found based on the
closest fit to the file name.  "Huh?  You mean if I go looking for my file
by its exact name, I might not find it?"  That's right.  The problem stems
from Microsoft's desperate attempts to make Windows 95 behave like an object
oriented operating system using the old underlying DOS 16-bit code.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->When you try to call for a DOS window, the window
refuses to open and you get a cryptic message saying "Incorrect DOS Version."
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
There are many other areas where people have pointed out deficiencies in
Win95.  The<!-- entering slot 17 --> point is, it is much too easy to pick
Windows 95 apart.  As this publication goes to press, Microsoft is perilously
close to the 60 day manufacturing period needed for its August delivery
commitment.  It is difficult to imagine that Microsoft will have all of
the kinks worked out of the operating system in time for August delivery.
 This could spell real trouble for Microsoft if they lose the marketing
momentum they've built up.
<P>
In a way, Windows 95 reminds me of the "new Coke" introduced in the mid-1980's
which nearly toppled giant Coca-Cola.  Like Coke, I believe Microsoft is
grossly underestimating the public's reaction to its product.  When the
operating system sputters and coughs up blood, Microsoft is going to lose
the allegiances of its loyal users.  This is when IBM must strike.
<P>
For the last couple of years IBM has been saying "here is gold," yet the
industry was content to settle for lead.  While OS/2 was winning technical
accolades, Microsoft was winning the hearts and minds of the public.  Essentially,
IBM has been trying unsuccessfully to slow down Microsoft's marketing machine.
 Now, it appears Microsoft is going to derail itself.  In fact, if IBM is
smart they could expedite the derailment by buying several copies of Windows
95 and simply display it next to OS/2.  Even the most naive DOS/Windows
user will quickly see the strengths of OS/2 and the flaws in Win95 in a
side-by-side comparison.
<P>
Some people see Win95 as a ploy by Microsoft to stem the movement to OS/2
and to buy the company sufficient time to develop Cairo for Windows NT.
 Whether this is true or not is irrelevant.  It's show time and Microsoft
has stalled long enough.  They simply have to deliver something, anything,
to stop OS/2.
<P>
While the hubbub of Comdex was concentrated on "Windows 95", IBM's John
Soyring quietly announced that OS/2 sales were accelerating and had surpassed
9 million copies sold.  Perhaps IBM's latest marketing phrase sums up the
state of OS/2.  Aimed at lampooning Microsoft's "Where do you want to go
tomorrow" phrase, IBM now touts OS/2 as "Where I want to go today" (see
our bitmap of the month). - Tim Bryce Editor,<I> OS/2 CONNECT</I>
