TEAM OS/2 is an international group of OS/2 enthusiasts who volunteer their
time and expertise in support of the operating system.  They are frequently
called upon for assistance at computer trade shows and exhibitions featuring
OS/2.  Unselfishly, they spend considerable time helping companies and individuals
by answering questions about OS/2. They also actively participate in OS/2
testing programs.
