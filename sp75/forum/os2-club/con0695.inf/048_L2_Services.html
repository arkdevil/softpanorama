The concept behind MBA's consulting services is actually quite simple:  Provide
clients with senior people who have extensive experience in I.S. and equipped
with proven methodologies and tools.
<P>
MBA consultants are not junior programmers nor recent college graduates.
They are seasoned professionals with an average of 20 years of experience
in I.S. management.  They are supported by MBA's "PRIDE" family of products,
an integrated product line providing tremendous leverage for analyzing businesses
and designing systems.  "PRIDE" is an effective means for managing projects,
producing quality deliverables at competitive prices, and assuring customer
satisfaction.  MBA's area of expertise includes:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
