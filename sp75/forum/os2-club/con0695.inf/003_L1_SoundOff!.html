"WHAT OS/2 NEEDS"
<P>
First, you have a great magazine with a great concept.  I would like to
add to an article from the May edition by R. Douglas Winnie titled "What
OS/2 Warp needs to succeed."
<P>
I agree totally with the first point about providing a slimmer OS/2 WPS.
 I find that it the WPS was more responsive it would add to the overall
feeling of the shell and therefore make it more pleasing to the user.
<P>
Also providing programs such as PM-Undelete and maybe a PM scan disk-clone
that can be used on HPFS is needed.
<P>
I have a few other points that I have compiled that I think IBM should take
into consideration, if it wants to become more competitive and appealing
to MS-Windows users:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Better common file dialog windows.  Give more
file information, and make more easy to use.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Better standard fonts, and update the Font Pallet.
 Make installing/removing fonts easier.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Revamp the interface slightly to better compete
with the futuristic looking Windows '95.  Although it is only skin deep,
it is still one of the advantages of using a GUI.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Have a grid method of arranging icons in folders,
like in Win '95, or even Workplace Shell for Windows.  Current methods look
messy sometimes.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Add an icon positioning util to the desktop folder
- x and y moving like in EXTDESK, and more align options.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Make MMOS/2 more integrated with the system,
with maybe a central configuration center where a nested tree could show
the installed parts - codecs, recorders, etc - with options to install and
remove components.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Have a dynamic mixer that can be added to changed
by<!-- entering slot 13 --> sound card manufactures.  For instance OS/2
might come standard with just a volume control, but when you install a Sound
Blaster 16 the mixer object can be updated to have Bass, Treble, Output
gain, CD, Line-in, etc. settings.  And possibly let you set the levels through
it and when they are set, make them be restored at every boot so that your
personal preferences of sound levels is always the same.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Have option of small/large fonts with hi-res
video drivers.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Option in the keyboard settings to set the status
of the NUMLOCK key on startup.  Or even have this option on the pages of
the program object settings.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
10.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>A more visual approach to system configuration,
e.g. nested trees, with install/removal options.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

a program object to create a icon on the desktop - not only shadows.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->

<B>Editor's Reply:</B>  Thank you for your comments.  I'de like to follow-up
on some of your points:<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<UL>
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->In terms of an "Undelete" function, see pages 127-129
of the<I> "User's Guide to OS/2 Warp"</I> accompanying the Warp package.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->For a "PM scan-disk" are you familiar with "Seek and
Scan FIle" (PMSEEK.EXE) in the "Productivity" folder?<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><LI><LI><LI> What more file information do you want?
 There are options to display just about anything.  Have you been using
the "Details" view of the "Drives" program?<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><LI><LI><LI> Since when does Windows 95 look "futuristic"?
 I've just seen the beta version of Win95 at Comdex and it strikes me as
a poor imitation of OS/2 (or as David Barnes puts it:  "Win95 looks like
Windows on steroids").<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->

<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><LI>11.  A calculator had been a part of the "Productivity"
folder for years (PMDCALC.EXE).  I'm surprised that it was overlooked in
the Warp release.  Until IBM corrects the problem you should be able to
pick one up off of one of the bulletin boards.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><LI>12.  What kind of features should be added to
the Icon Editor? I've been using it for five years now and have had little
problem with it.<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><LI>13.  This is the intent of the "Template" folder.
 If you want faster access, simply put it on the desktop or on the launchpad.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><LI>14.  Better cache????  Please be more specific.
<!-- lm: 0x2 3 -->
<P>
<LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 --><LI>15.  I understand your point but where do you
draw the line?  The documentation accompanying OS/2 Warp is geared to getting
the average user up and running with the operating system.  The average
user would find advanced documentation for programmers boring and a waste
of time.  I'm sure this is why IBM didn't include it.  If they did, it would
probably wipe out the cottage industry of companies writing the volumes
of books on OS/2 (see the Books section of the newsletter).<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->

<P>
Justin, this is not to suggest your points are not without merit.  There
is always room for improvement.  But as a vendor of software products for
the last 20 years, I have seen far too many people come up with "wish lists"
for product improvements without any business rationale.  I can tell you
from experience that you will have greater success selling your ideas to
vendors such as IBM if you take the time to explain your reasoning and potential
benefits. - Tim Bryce
