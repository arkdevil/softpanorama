<!-- entering slot 1 -->Purpose &amp; How Distributed
<BR>

<P>
The intent of<I> OS/2 CONNECT</I> is to become your desktop repository for
sources of OS/2 information.  Having been an OS/2 user since 1990 (version
1.2) we appreciate the need for developing and maintaining contacts in support
of the operating system.  What we are trying to do is become the authoritative
source for OS/2 contacts in the world.  We do not consider ourselves in
competition with any other publication.  In fact, we welcome the opportunity
to cooperate with other publications in promoting OS/2.  Being an independent
company, not related in any way to IBM, we believe we can be a fair and
impartial source of information for all vendors related to OS/2, not just
Big Blue.
<P>
Our staff constantly sifts through a wide range of books, magazines, mailing
lists, computer networks, bulletin boards, news/press releases, and other
industrial contacts to research the current names, numbers and addresses
of vendors and institutions supporting OS/2.  But we realize that we are
not perfect and people tend to change jobs and addresses frequently.  If
there is a name or number we have overlooked, or something requiring correction,
please let us know about it as soon as possible.  In this day and age of
electronic communications, there should be no reason why you cannot send
us correspondence or a press release.  In other words, please do not hesitate
to contact us regarding ideas for improving the newsletter or to send us
updates and corrections.
<P>
WHY THE INF FORMAT?
<P>
We deliberately chose the INF file format to distribute<I> OS/2 CONNECT
</I>not only because it is becoming increasingly popular with OS/2 users,
but it is also one of the most efficient file formats for electronically
distributing text and graphics. Experienced users will already be familiar
with the OS/2 "View" utility (VIEW.EXE) and will be able to quickly find
their way through<I> OS/2 CONNECT.</I>  If you are a new OS/2 user, please
take a moment to learn the facility.  Standard Help facilities are available
to guide you through "View."  In particular, review the following features:

<P>
Under the Services action-bar-choice:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
Search - to find every occurrence of a word or phrase in an on-line document.
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Print - to send to the printer one or more topics for the document you are
viewing; the index for the document; the Table of Contents for the document.
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Bookmark - to save your place in the document you are viewing, by marking
the topic displayed. <!-- entering slot 2 --> You can then return to that
topic later.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Copy to file - places the text you are viewing into an ASCII text file (text.tmp).
 Note:  This file is re-initialized each time you use the "Copy to file"
command.  In other words, you may lose your text if you are not careful.
<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Append to file - updates your text file (text.tmp) with additional text.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
Under the Options action-bar-choice:<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<UL>
<P>
Expanding - provides the means to display subordinate topics in the Table
of Contents.  The user can either expand one level, a selected branch, or
all.  Subordinate topics are indicated when the plus sign (+) is displayed
to the left of a subject.  Instead of using one of the expanding pull-down-choices,
the user can simply click on the (+) with the mouse.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Collapsing - provides the reverse function of expanding; it removes the
display of lower level topics in the Table of Contents.  The user can collapse
either a selected branch or all.  Instead of using one of the collapse pull-down-choices,
the user can simply click on the minus sign (-) to the left of the parent
topic.<!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->
<P>
Index - displays an alphabetic list of references to the topics in the document.
 The user can select one of the index entries to display the related topic.
<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
The "View" utility is accessed either by clicking on its standard icon (in
the shape of a book), or by typing the "VIEW" command, followed by the targeted
INF file, through an OS/2 Window or Full Screen.  For example:
<PRE>C:\VIEW CONNECT.INF</PRE>

<P>
For additional information about "View," consult the following:
<P>
Select/click on the Information icon on the OS/2 Desktop, and then:<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<UL>
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Select/click on the OS/2 Command Reference icon.
<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Select OS/2 Commands by Name.<!-- lm: 0x2 2 -->
<P>
 <LI><LI><!-- lm: 0x2 6 -->Select VIEW.<!-- lm: 0x2 1 -->
</UL>
<P>
You may also access the same information by going to the command line (an
OS/2 Window or Full Screen) and typing:  HELP VIEW
<P>
Printed documentation is available from IBM's OS/2 Technical Library:  Information
Presentation Facility Guide and Reference.
<P>
"View" and "IPF/INF file formats" are commonly found in OS/2 related text
books.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> <I> OS/2 CONNECT</I> is compiled using the Information Presentation
Facility (IPF) compiler using the standard National Language Support (NLS)
for the United States. If requested, the source code can be re-compiled
by the publisher to suit a different Country Code and Code Page (but not
translated).  Please send requests to the publisher.
