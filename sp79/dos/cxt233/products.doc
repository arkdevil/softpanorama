The SXT Software Exploration Tools
==================================

The SXT Software Exploration Tools are a collection of software analysis
tools providing a similar functionality for different programming languages.

* CXT - C Exploration Tools
  - CFT - C Function Tree Generator
    Tool to analyse and display the function call relationships within
    the source code of C/C++ programs.
  - CST - C Structure Tree Generator
    Tool to analyse and display the structure/class relationships within
    the source code of C/C++ programs.

* DXT - DBASE Exploration Tools
  - DFT - DBASE Function Tree Generator
    Tool to analyse and display the function call relationships within
    the source code of DBASE, CLIPPER '87 and other XBASE-like programs.

* FXT - FORTRAN Exploration Tools
  - FFT - FORTRAN Function Tree Generator
    Tool to analyse and display the function call relationships within
    the source code of FORTRAN programs.

* LXT - LISP Exploration Tools
  - LFT - LISP Function Tree Generator
    Tool to analyse and display the function call relationships within
    the source code of LISP and SCHEME programs.

Each of these packages consists of the analysis program ("Analyser") and
a recall program ("Navigator") for reuse of the analysis results, which
can be stored in a database. There are also macros to integrate these tools
into popular editors like BRIEF, QEDIT or MicroEMACS.

Each package is available for the following systems:

SXT command line versions:
* DOS real mode                 (shareware release)
* DOS protected mode            (registered users only)
* Windows NT text mode          (registered users only)
* OS/2 text mode                (registered users only)

SXTWIN Windows versions:
* Windows 3.1                   (shareware release)
* Windows 32 bit (Win32s)       (registered users only)

There are no plans to port the SXT programs to other platforms or operating
systems like Apple MacIntosh, UNIX (SCO, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, Linux, ...),
Atari or Amiga. The source code of the SXT programs is not available.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: Although the Windows NT and OS/2 versions were directly
derived from the DOS versions, there was no possibility to test their
functionality and behaviour with the same completeness compared to the DOS
versions. There is absolutely no guarantee that these versions will work
with the same reliability as the DOS versions.
