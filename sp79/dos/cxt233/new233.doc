CXT 2.20
Compatibility version with the new SXT packages DXT, FXT, LXT.

CXT 2.13
- additional work on the documentation
- minor changes in CST byte offset file generation (source information)
- error in CFT/CST database reading fixed (could only happen if line numbers
  were not in strictly ascending order inside functions or structures, this
  is possible if #line directives are used, e.g. with code generators like
  LEX/FLEX/YACC/BISON)
- internal database structure changed and extended
- CFT error with nested C++ constructs 'extern "C" { ... }' fixed (this was
  sometimes the reason for the error message 'unbalanced braces')
- detection and displaying of multiple inclusions of the same include file,
  size of scanned sources and number of lines are calculated for multiple
  inclusions
- preprocessor intermediate file extension changed to '.II' to avoid conflicts
  with compiler generated files having extension '.I'
- __TIMESTAMP__ macro in preprocessor supported
- Microsoft VC++ 1.0 for Windows NT preprocessing support
- Borland C++ 1.0 for OS/2 preprocessing support
- every section in the output file shows the related option for its generation
- option -Jcharset: add extended character set for identifier recognition, this
  allows the use of national character sets
- option -//: accept C++ comments in C source code (ensure compatibility with
  Microsoft and Borland C compilers)
- option -RATIONAL: generate a Rational Rose Petal file for callgraph
  visualisation (see documentation for detailed description!)
- option -time: print runtime information
- option -cmdline: write the command line at the beginning of the output file
- for option -I: -I* ignores missing include files during preprocessing
- BRIEF and MicroEMACS macro files changed
- CFTN and CSTN with new option -o[name]: print output to file 'name'
- return values for CFTN and CSTN changed to avoid conflicts with DOS errors
  (affects BRIEF macros)

CXT 2.12
- system requirements for real mode versions are now Intel 80286 or higher
  (8088, 8086 and 80186 are no longer supported)
- C++ class hierarchy graph listing
- better C++ operator handling
- preprocessor macro size increased
- new BRIEF macro help screen
- BRIEF macro key assignment changed
- new MicroEMACS macros added and existing ones redesigned
- CST byteoffset option extended and byteoffset file redesigned
  (fewer macros -> faster compilation + smaller executable)
- Borland C++ 3.1 preprocessing supported
- additional C++ preprocessor defines for Borland and GNU supported
- new transfer batch files for calling CFT and CST from inside the
  Borland IDE and displaying the results
- option -m: -m+ starts output with topmost function/structure of
  largest call graph
- option -y: file cross link list, show referencing/referenced files
- option -e: delimiter character can be user defined
- option -L: -L+ for both screen output and redirection to file
             -LL[+] appends to existing file
