INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

To install this software copy all files into one directory, for example into
your 'UTILITY'-directory or any other directory, for example 'C:\CXT' or
'C:\SXT', and add this directory to your system path. This is necessary so
that you can invoke the programs directly from other directories. Note that
especially for using the BRIEF macros this path must be set to access the
recall programs (CFTN, CSTN, ...).

You must copy the BRIEF macro files (extension .CM) to the BRIEF macro
directory so that you can use the autoload function for BRIEF macros and
must not specify the complete path when you want to load the macros. The
MicroEMACS macro file CXT_ME.CMD must be copied to the MicroEMACS
directory. The QEDIT macro file CXT_QEDT.DAT must be compiled into the
QEDIT binary macro format with QMAC. For detailed information see the
QEDIT documentation.


ADDITIONAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWS 3.1 VERSIONS

Copy the EXE-file(s) xxxWIN.EXE (xxx = CFT, CST, ...) to a common
directory. Then create a new program icon for each EXE-file via the
File New option of the Program Manager. The DLL-files (CFTNWIN.DLL,
CSTNWIN.DLL, ...) should be copied to the \windows\system directory.
The example application requires the Visual Basic run-time library
VBRUN300.DLL being installed in the \windows\system directory.

The file CTL3D.DLL (support for 3D dialogs) is also included. It must
be copied to the \windows\system directory (only if there isn't already
another copy installed)


ADDITIONAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWS 32 BIT VERSIONS

See INSTALL.W32 for detailed instructions.


ADDITIONAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR OS/2 VERSIONS

If you want to use the database access functions (CFTN4OS2.EXE, ...)
with BRIEF for OS/2 and the BRIEF macros (CXT.CM, ...), you have to rename
the database access functions to CFTN.EXE (resp. CSTN.EXE, ...) to ensure a
correct behaviour. Registered users can also change the macro source files
and recompile them.
