        Welcome to CXT - the C EXPLORATION TOOLS!

        The C Function Tree Generator (CFT)  and  the  C  Structure  Tree
        Generator (CST) are powerful program development, maintenance and
        documentation  tools.  They provide the programmer the ability to
        analyse the C or C++ source code of applications,  no matter  how
        big  or complex they are.  CFT and CST are very useful to explore
        new,   unknown  software  and  to  support  software  reuse   and
        maintenance.

        By preprocessing, scanning and analyzing the program source code,
        these  programs  build an internal representation of the function
        call hierarchy (CFT) and of the data structure  (CST)  relations.
        The analysis is done with the original source code, no additional
        editing  to  mark  functions  or data types in the source code is
        necessary.  Several  features  and  options  allow  the  user  to
        customize  the generated hierarchy tree chart output and to get a
        large set of useful information about the source code.

        An important feature is the database generation which allows  the
        recalling  of  information without reprocessing the source.  This
        database can again be read from CFT and CST to produce  different
        outputs or to add new files to the database.  The database format
        is dBASE compatible. Special recall programs called CFTN and CSTN
        allow fast searching for items in the  database.  These  programs
        can  be  used  within  any  environment,  for example from inside
        editors  like  BRIEF,   QEDIT  or  MicroEMACS  (DOS  and  WINDOWS
        version),  to  provide  a full software project management system
        with  access  to  all  functions  and  data  types  with  just  a
        keystroke.  This  feature  makes  a comfortable "hypertext source
        code browser and locator" system out of the editor.  The  windows
        version provides an additionally DLL for database access.

        The  generation of output files compatible with HTML viewers like
        NCSA Mosaic,  Netscape or WinWord Internet Assistant is possible.
        Also  RTF output files which can be compiled for Windows Help and
        output for the Rational Rose CASE tool is possible.

        Other features are the calculation of the critical function  call
        path  and deepest structure nesting level or the support for byte
        offset calculation for selected structures/unions by CST. For C++
        code a class inheritance graph can be generated.  It is  possible
        to  generate  formatted  ASCII  text  files  with  lists  of  the
        functions/data types and the scanned files which can be  used  as
        input  for  other  programs  like  wordprocessors  or spreadsheet
        calculators.

        This  software  package  is  provided  either  as  a   compressed
        self-extracting  archive  file  CXTnmm.EXE  (C  EXPLORATION TOOLS
        version n.mm) or as a ZIPped archive file CXTnmm.ZIP. The Windows
        versions are named CXTWnmm.EXE (C EXPLORATION TOOLS version  n.mm
        for Windows) or CXTWnmm.ZIP.
