        KNOWN PROBLEMS AND BUGS

        This document describes  known  problems  and  bugs  of  the  SXT
        programs. They have been found during testing or were reported by
        users.  I  provide  this  list for informational purposes so that
        every user can have a look at the problems he/she  may  run  into
        (but  hopefully  does  not).  This  list  may also influence your
        decision,  either positive or negative,  whether to  register  or
        not,  but  I  think everbody should know about before what he/she
        will get.

        For additional information and more general questions you  should
        also  look  at  the  chapters  'PROGRAM  LIMITATIONS',   'TROUBLE
        SHOOTING' and 'FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS' in SXT.DOC.

        If a real bug is reported I try to fix it if  this  can  be  done
        with reasonable effort but I cannot give a guarantee (Remember: I
        do  all these things in my free time,  this is not the job I earn
        my money!).  I can do a fix only if I am able  to  reproduce  the
        bug,  therefore it is necessary to provide example code (as small
        as possible,  concentrate on the problem) which causes the error.
        If possible,  the memory address where the error occured would be
        very helpful.  I also need  information  about  your  system:  OS
        version (DOS,  Windows,  Win32, OS/2, NT), available memory size,
        installed drivers,  network,  concurrently running programs,  ...
        (everything  that  could  be  important  to help me searching the
        problem).

        NOTE: AS DESCRIBED IN THE "DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY" SECTION OF THE
        SXT DOCUMENTATION (SXT.DOC) THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND
        WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.  THEREFORE THERE IS  ABSOLUTELY  NO
        GUARANTEE THAT THE AUTHOR WILL FIX A BUG.

        GENERAL PROTECTION FAULT WITH SXTWIN PROGRAMS
        It  has been reported that SXTWIN programs sometimes crash with a
        general protection (GP) fault when the Borland IDE is  run  in  a
        Windows DOS-box at the same time. This may happen also with other
        programs  running  in  a  DOS-box but the Borland IDE is the only
        reported until now.
        REASON: This  is  a  probably  a  problem  with  limited  Windows
        resources (memory, device contexts, file handles). There may be a
        conflict  with  the  limited  number of only 5 (!) windows device
        contexts which  are  necessary  to  access  the  screen  from  an
        application for writing text output. Probably the IDE takes a lot
        of the resources especially if many windows are opened.
        WORKAROUND: None

        SXT COMMAND LINE VERSIONS SOMETIMES CRASH IN WINDOWS DOS-BOX
        It  has  been  reported  by  users  that  under  certain  unknown
        circumstances the SXT command line programs hang during execution
        in a Windows DOS-box.  However,  they are working  well  in  OS/2
        DOS-boxes.
        REASON: Unknown
        WORKAROUND: None


        PROBLEMS  WITH  CHANGING  DRIVE  AND/OR  DIRECTORY  FROM SXTWIN32
        PROGRAMS
        It has been reported that  on  some  systems  the  Win32s  SXTWIN
        programs  cannot  change directory and drive from within the file
        (and other) dialog boxes.  On some  systems  changes  to  network
        (e.g.  NFS)  drives were not possible while changes between local
        drives work well. Also the behaviour of the same SXTWIN32 program
        version was different on the various  Win32s  subsystems  it  was
        used (v1.15a,  v1.20,  v1.25).  For example, while all things are
        working well with v1.15a (including access of network drives), it
        does not work with v1.20 installed on the same system. The 16 bit
        Windows versions, however, seem to have no such problems.
        REASON: Unknown.  It is probably related to the Win32s subsystems
        and/or the (more or less) compatible 32 bit libraries.  There may
        also be changes  in  the  behaviour  on  the  different  language
        versions of Win32s.
        WORKAROUND: None


        FATAL  ERRORS  DURING  C PREPROCESSING WITH PROGRAMS THAT COMPILE
        WITHOUT ERRORS
        If reasons like missing include paths (-I), (un)defines (-U,  -D)
        or  file  open/access  errors have been excluded as source of the
        errors,  there remain still some  cases  where  the  preprocessor
        reports 'fatal error:...'.
        REASON:  The integrated preprocessor (which is in fact the oldest
        part of CXT -  prior  to  ANSI-C)  has  problems  with  recursive
        expansion  of  macros  ("rescanning") and with expansion of macro
        parameters,  especially if the  source  makes  extensive  use  of
        stringizing  #  or  catenation ##.  This is a bug in CFT and CST.
        Unfortunately,  I do currently see no chance  to  fix  this  bug,
        cause this would require a major rewrite of the preprocessor.
        WORKAROUND:  Either use option -NOUNSAFE or,  better,  preprocess
        the sources  with  your  compiler  specific  preprocessor  to  an
        intermediate  file  and analyse the resulting output.  Be sure to
        enable the insertion of  '#line  ...'  directives  to  get  valid
        filename and line number references.


        FILEOPEN  ERROR  MESSAGE  'INVALID ARGUMENTS' WITH OS2 AND NT SXT
        VERSIONS
        All SXT programs currently support only the DOS 8.3  file  naming
        convention.  Attempts  to  open  files  with  a  longer  filename
        extension than 3 characters may lead the described error. This is
        especially the case if the OS2 and NT  versions  are  working  on
        files  which  are  stored  on  a DOS file system.  The OS2 and NT

        versions are working well on their 'natural' file  systems,  HPFS
        (OS2) resp. NTFS (NT). There is currently no work around for this
        problem.
