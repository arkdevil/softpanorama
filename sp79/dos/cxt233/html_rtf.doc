        SOME REMARKS ABOUT THE HTML AND RTF FEATURES OF THE SXT PROGRAMS

        Since the April 95 release all SXT programs can  generate  output
        in  HTML  (HyperText  Markup Language) and RTF (Rich Text Format)
        format in addition to the default SXT  ASCII  output  files.  The
        HTML  output  can  be  viewed  with WWW Clients like NCSA Mosaic,
        Netscape or Lynx and with HTML add-ons like Microsoft WinWord 6.0
        Internet Assistant.  The RTF output can be  used  to  compile  MS
        Windows Help files,  but can also be read with any word processor
        which supports the RTF file format.  Both output formats  support
        the  definition  of  hypertext anchors and links to allow a quick
        navigation  between  related  topics.   The  SXT  programs   make
        extensive  usage  of these features to provide different views on
        the source code analysis results. The HTML output is divided into
        four closely related  documents  to  reduce  the  file  size  for
        document  loading,  the  RTF  output is written to one file.  The
        internal HTML hypertext links across files require that all files
        are located in the same directory.  This allows that the SXT HTML
        output  results  can  be  viewed  from a remote WWW client over a
        network if a WWW daemon has access to them.

        Following are some remarks related to the HTML and  RTF  features
        of  the SXT programs to give the user some additional information
        and help.


        HTML FILENAMES
        The HTML filenames inside the HTML files have the file  extension
        '.HTML'  and  are  written  in uppercase letters.  On MS-DOS file
        systems the  file  extension  is  truncated  automatically  to  3
        letters  and  the file names are case-insensitive,  so there's no
        problem with viewers like Mosaic or Netscape.  However,  if  such
        HTML files are copied to a Unix system, it is necessary to change
        the  extension from '.HTM' to '.HTML' and to ensure that the file
        names are in uppercase letters.  These or  similar  problems  may
        also  occur  to  HTML files generated with the OS2 and Windows NT
        versions, especially if this is done on a DOS file system.


        VIEWING HTML FILES WITH NCSA MOSAIC
        If the HTML output is viewed with  the  WWW  client  NCSA  Mosaic
        there  is  a problem with jumps inside a document: such jumps are
        not handled correct and will usually display  a  wrong  location.
        This is a problem of Mosaic which is obviously no able to do such
        jumps inside locally stored and loaded documents. Therefore it is
        recommended  to  use the Netscape WWW client to get best results.
        This viewer also requires less memory compared to Mosaic.


        UNRESOLVED LINKS
        In some situations there are unresolved links to items which will
        result in jumps to wrong locations (HTML) or in an error  message
        (RTF  Windows  Help).  This  happens if only a part of the source



                                      - 1 -


        code is analysed or if not all items are listed  in  the  output,
        e.g.  because  options like -r -a -u are missing or only selected
        items are displayed (options -S -Q).


        ERROR MESSAGES DURING COMPILATION OF CST GENERATED RTF FILES WITH
        WINDOWS HELP COMPILER
        While compiling CST generated RTF files  to  Windows  Help  files
        there  will  be  error messages like 'context string ...  already
        used'.  This is normal because this usually refers to basic  data
        types like 'int' which are not referenced.


        ITEM FORMAT IN THE HTML AND RTF SXT OUTPUT
        The  output  format  of the items (functions,  data types) is the
        same as in the ASCII listing.

        - Each item is defined by its  name,  its  type  (if  available),
        followed  by  a  unique  identifier,   status  information,  file
        location and line number:

        int main()  (1) <D> <test.c, 12>
                     ^        ^
        The identifier and the file name (marked with ^) are  hyper  text
        links to the cross reference table resp. file table.

        -  If an already referenced item is displayed again then the item
        name itself is a hyper text link to the first definition.

        - The cross reference  table  contains  for  each  calling  resp.
        called  item the number of calls from/ to it.  The item for which
        the specific relations are shown  displays  the  summary  in  the
        format <# calls to, # calls from>.

        - The HTML file "progNAMES.HTML" (prog = CFT,  CST, ...) contains
        a lexicographical sorted list of all items with links to the item
        definition, the cross reference table and the file table. For RTF
        generated Windows help files a quite similar sorted list  can  be
        found via the 'Search' button.
