1. About BestCrypt system installation

   To install BestCrypt system run Setup.exe program
   supplied on the installation disk.

   If you are planning to use WINDOWS application 
   'BestCrypt Control Panel' you should run MS WINDOWS 
   and start 'Setup.exe' from BestCrypt installation disk.
   
   Setup will create program group for BestCrypt Control Panel
   and insert BestCrypt Auto Mount utility to StartUp program 
   group.

   If you have no WINDOWS installed on your computer you 
   should run Setup.exe from DOS prompt.

   


2. For Windows95 users.

   When you close BestCrypt virtual drive for access,
   Windows95 File System Manager (FSM) flushes all
   file caches for the virtual drive. But FSM continue 
   to store information about directory tree structure 
   for some time. 
   
   If you want FSM to forget that information, you 
   should simply run 'Refresh' function in 'View' menu 
   of Windows95 Explorer program. 
   
   It may be useful, for example, if you have the one 
   container opened using X: drive, then you wish to 
   close that container, link another container to the
   same virtual drive X: and open it.


3. For users who have not-English version of Windows
   
   BestCrypt installation program for Windows (Setup.exe)
   places 'Auto Mount' utility to the Windows 'StartUp'
   group. All programs in that group automatically run 
   during Windows start up time.  
   
   If BestCrypt software is not localized for your 
   language we recommend you to do the next:

   a) define what group corresponds to 'StartUp' 
      group in English Windows;
   b) move 'Auto Mount' utility from 'StartUp' group to
      the group you found as appropriate.
   c) delete 'StartUp' group
