Since there are a lot of questions about the differences between the various
chips used in the IBM PC, IBM PC/XT, IBM PC/AT, IBM PS/2 and compatibles, this
list, containing their CPUs and NPXs, has been compiled for the benefit of
the net community. I hope it can answer some questions.

This list is the result of collecting many snippets of information from
USENET News and data books. Furthermore, various contributors and others have
helped to make this list to what it is today. Thank you all.

    1  Introduction

    1.1  Identification

Manufacturer: name and/or logo.
Part number.
Revision number, step level.
Date: often the week number and the year of manufacturing.

Memory chips: capacity: 64, 256 kbit,
                        1, 4, 16 Mbit,
              speed: 10, 15, 20, 40, 60, 70, 80, 100, 120, 150 ns.

Orientation: indicated by a hole or a dot; from this indication the pin
             numbering starts contra clock-wise with number 1.

For microprocessors at boot the chip mask revision number is often left in one
of the control registers.

In the newer SL enhanced Intel i80486 CPUs (if bit 21 in EFLAGS can be
toggled) and the Intel Pentium CPUs a CPUID instruction is available:
  EAX=0: EAX: highest input value recognized by CPUID
         EBX-EDX: vendor ID string: Intel: "GenuineIntel"
                                    AMD: "AuthenticAMD"
                                    Cyrix: "CyrixInstead"
                                    UMC: "UMC UMC UMC"
  EAX=1: EAX: bit 0-3: step level
              bit 4-7: model
              bit 8-11: family: 4: 486,
                                5: Pentium
              bit 12-31: reserved
         EBX-ECX: reserved
         EDX (feature bits): bit 0: on-chip FPU
                             bit 1-6: I/O Breakpoints available
                                      Page Size extensions (single-level page
                                        table with 4 Mbyte pages)
                                      Time Stamp Counter available (RDTSC)
                                      Machine Specific Registers available
                                        (RDMSR/WRMSR)
                             bit 7: Machine Check Exception
                             bit 8: CMPXCHG8B instruction

SIMM (Single In-line Memory Module) (Wang): contains a complete RAM bank.
MAC SIMMs are only 8 bits wide; they don't contain a parity bit.
However, there are Personal Computers around in which the RAM chips for parity
checking are build-in on the motherboard, that need 8 bit SIMMs.

  9-chip SIMM: 9 chips of 1 bit wide
  8-chip SIMM: 8 chips of 1 bit wide (MAC)
  3-chip SIMM: 2 chips of 4 bits wide and 1 chip of 1 bit wide
               3 chips of 3 bits wide
  2-chip SIMM: 2 chips of 4 bits wide (MAC)

If the correct refresh is supplied SIMMs with a different number of chips and
different speed can be used together.

SIP (Single In-line Package): contains a complete RAM bank.

The orientation of SIMMs and SIPs is indicated by a hole. Starting from this
indication the numbering of the pins starts with number 1. Apart from the pins
there is no difference at all between SIMMs and SIPs.

The normal SIMMs and SIPs have 30 pins/pads. There are also 36 pin SIMMs and
SIPs. The extra pins are used for speed detection by the motherboard.

There are also 72 pin SIMMs. These are 32 bits and 4 parity bits wide. 4 pins
are assigned for speed detection. They are mostly used in newer Personal
Computers.
Capacity: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 Mwords.

DIMM: 64 bit memory module.

For a long time 0.6 micron geometries were thought to be a limit imposed by
the electron microscopes used for mask alignment, but then the X-ray
lithography was invented...


    1.4  JEDEC (Joint Electronic Device Engeneering Council)

JEDEC was first known for their DIP definitions for memory chips.

JEDEC has suggested a new standard of 3.3 V for all electronic components,
including CPUs. CPUs operating at 3.3 V consume less than 50 % of the power
of their 5 V equivalents. Intel currently uses a manufacturing process with a
resolution of 0.8 micron, but is starting production with a 0.6 micron
process. This produces chips that can only operate reliably at 3.3 V, which
means that all its future CPUs are likely to operate only at this lower
voltage.


    1.5  Manufacturers

    1.5.1  Intel

The company was founded in 1968 by Gordon Moore, currently the chairman, and
the late Bob Noyce. The original name was M & N Electronics, but was changed
to Intel (Integrated Electronics).

Intel makes the base models: i8086/i8088, i80286, i80386, i80486, Pentium,
                             i8087, i80287, i80387.
iapx stands for Intel Advanced Processor architecture.

Intel lost its claim to the `386' and `486' trademarks, which is why the
Pentium is not called the `586'.

Currently, Intel is fighting to protect its various patents and its copyright
of the 386 and 486 microcode. The legal situation is complicated by various
license agreements made by Intel in the past.

SMM (System Management Mode) can be used to manage the CPU's power demands.
When a CPU enters SMM it saves its current state in a special memory area,
SMRAM (System Management RAM) and then runs a program, also stored in in
SMRAM, the SMM handler. Static core is necessary.
SMM is implemented in all Intel i...SL CPUs. In June 1993, Intel announced
it was discontinuing its SL range and instead making all its current
processors SL enhanced. Intel has also introduced an Auto Idle state for its
clock doubled CPUs: the internal clock can be dropped down to the external
clock speed while the processor is waiting for data, returning to full speed
as soon as the data arrives.

In February 1994 Intel opened its $750,000,000 costing Fab 10 in Leixlip,
Ireland. There the 0.6 micron CMOS Intel i80486DX4 CPU and Intel Pentium CPU
series are produced. In the future the Intel P6 CPU and Intel P7 CPU series
will be produced here too.
Intel has agreed to invest $7,000,000,000 in Ireland over the next five years.

In June 1994 Intel and Hewlett-Packard agreed to develope a new 64 bit RISC
CPU together (Intel P7 CPU / HP PA9000 CPU). The CPU will be based on the HP
Precision Architecture (PA) and be able to emulate the Intel X86 architecture.
Together the both companies will invest $1,000,000,000 in the development of
the new CPU.

    1.5.2  AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)

AMD holds a second source license which dates back to the 8086. In the early
days mainframe companies had a rule that no chip would be used in a design,
unless it could be bought from at least two companies.

AMD invented a CMOS process that was faster than Intel's and vendors started
using them as a primary source.

DEC will manufacture 486 chips for AMD, increasing AMD's production.

In October 1994 TSMC agreed to produce AMD Am486 CPUs for AMD in its
0.5 micron technology. The production of AMD Am486DX4 CPUs in Taiwan will
start in the third quarter of 1994.

In January 1995 Intel and AMD cancelled all pending lawsuits against
eachother. AMD can keep on using the 386 and 486 microcode, but not those of
the later CPUs.

    1.5.3  IBM (International Bussiness Machines)

Jack Kuehler, Armonk.

IBM's licensing arrangements with Intel preclude them from selling their CPUs
directly. They can only sell these CPUs as long as they are sold with a
minimum amount of `added value'.
IBM is not allowed to produce any FPUs.

From September 1993 IBM is manufacturing the Cyrix 486 CPUs in their
0.5 micron CMOS technology. In the future they will also produce the
Cyrix M1 CPU.

IBM WWW server: www.ibm.com


    1.5.4  Chips & Technologies

George Taylor.
Founded in 1984 by Gordon Campbell.

Chips & Technologies has dropped its development of X86 clones.


    1.5.5  Cyrix

Cyrix implemented the chips they wanted to manufacture from the specifications
of the originals (clean room). They had Texas Instruments produce these chips
for them. A certain number was going to Cyrix to be resold, and the rest was
sold by Texas Instruments directly.

From September 1993 IBM is manufacturing the Cyrix 486 CPUs and in the future
they will also produce the Cyrix M1 CPU.

Cyrix WWW server: www.cyrix.com

Cyrix fax-back service: 1-800-46-CYRIX (1-800-462-9749).


    1.5.6  Texas Instruments

Texas Instruments used to be Cyrix's major producer (SGS-Thomson was the other
one). In 1994 Texas Instruments stopped producing chips for Cyrix and now
make their own chips under license from Cyrix. Texas Instruments has rights to
make modifications to these chips.

Contemporary 16 bit CPUs to 8086/8088 were Zilog Z8000 CPU,
Fairchild 9445 CPU, Texas Instruments TI9900 CPU and Mil-Std 1750A CPU.
Last is reason DOD (Department Of Defence) contractors were not interested in
8086/8088. Mil-Std 1750A CPU was specified in all contracts of 1979 - 1984
period.
Texas Instruments TI9900 CPU was probably the best of the lot, but
Texas Instruments considered it a closed architecture, so no-one used it.

Cyrix FasMath Cx83D87 NPX (until November 1991), IIT IIT-3C87 NPX) caused
crashes. These are caused by synchronisation errors in FSAVE and FSTOR
instructions. Later, improved CPUs have an AB prefix printed in the lower
right corner. The Cyrix FasMath 387+ NPX (European name for
Cyrix FasMath Cx83D87 NPX from November 1991) causes no trouble when
co-operating with a bad Cyrix Cx486DLC CPU.

Cyrix FasCache Cx486DX/Cx486DX2 CPU FP bug: when a register load instruction
is followed by an instruction that clears the FP status register (FCLEX), and
the memory location being referenced is not in the CPU's internal cache, the
external memory bus cycle is aborted by the FCLEX instruction and the register
is not loaded properly.
Since this code sequence is very unlikely to occur in any software, the bug
will probably not be fixed at all.

    2.37  Intel Overdrive CPU for Intel i80486 CPU

Many 486 CPU motherboards contain an Intel Overdrive socket in which a more
powerful CPU can be placed (ODP: OverDrive Processor), this being an
Intel i80486DX2 CPU, an Intel i80486DX4 CPU, or an Intel Pentium CPU. It is
possible to remove the old CPU while upgrading. All output pins of the
original CPU are put in 3-state and the power consumption is reduced when the
UP# pin (Upgrade Present) is activated.

An Intel Overdrive CPU will be made available that will fit in the original
PGA (Pin Grid Array) (ODPR: OverDrive Processor Replacement), so motherboards
without an Intel Overdrive socket can be upgraded too.

At this moment it is still unsure if all motherboards with an
Intel Overdrive socket can indeed be upgraded to an Intel Pentium CPU. The
Intel Pentium P24T CPU (ODP), the Intel Pentium CPU upgrade for the blue
238 pin PGA Overdrive socket, appears to produce too much heat for most
thermally not compliant systems. It is not even sure if there will ever be an
Intel Pentium CPU upgrade for those motherboards at all (see Intel Overdrive
Processor Upgradability Guide). For the newer motherboards with a white
237 pin PGA Overdrive socket, that do satisfy the heat specifications, there
will be an Intel Pentium CPU at 3.3 V with a ventilator on the IC. There are
also black 168 pin Overdrive sockets around; these can contain an
Intel i80486DX2 ODP CPU or an Intel i80486DX4 ODP CPU. For the black 169 pin
Overdrive sockets of 486SX systems, an Intel i80487SX CPU, an
Intel i80486DX2 ODP CPU, or an Intel i80486DX4 ODP CPU is available.

In October 1994 Dr. Thomas R. Nicely, Professor of Mathematics at the
Lynchburg College, Lynchburg, Virginia (nicely@acavax.lynchburg.edu), reported
a bug present in the FPU of all Intel Pentium CPUs. The double precision part
of the mantissa is not computed correctly when dividing in some areas of the
mantissa space of the divisor. The bug is fixed in Intel Pentium CPUs produced
after November 1994.
