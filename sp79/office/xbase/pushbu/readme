INTRODUCTION

Awhile back I wrote a little program PUSHBU.PRG to produce pushbuttons with
pop-out action and a number of people (including myself) have used them
without any compaints.  Nonetheless, PUSHBU.PRG was really never properly 
integrated into the Get System, mainly because of the way it handled 
the waitstate.

Meanwhile, another public domain offering by Dan Comeau (RADIOBTN.PRG) is
well integrated with the get system, but does not include any push buttons,
and if you're not already using RADIOBTN.PRG you may wish to take a look
at it.  Anyway, to make a long story shorter, I finally have gotten around
to putting my push buttons into a modified version of Dan's button engine.



UPDATE OVERVIEW

The buttons have been in use by a number of people around the world
for nearly a year and this current update includes bug fixes and
suggestions which I've receive from those users.  Thanks to everyone
who has contacted me.

This will probably be the last update of PUSHBU since most of us will be
moving on to VO real soon!  Nonetheless, if you find any bugs I'd
appreciate hearing from you.
