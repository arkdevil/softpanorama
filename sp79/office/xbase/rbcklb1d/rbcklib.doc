1     INTRODUCTION --------------------------------------------------------

      RBckLib is a CA-CLIPPER LIBRARY with MULTIPLE-DISK BACKUP AND RESTORE
      FUNCTIONS.
      The data will be COMPRESSED while being backed up !

      Because RBckLib is partially written in ASSEMBLER its functions are
      VERY FAST !

      Three libraries are enclosed :

      RBck_S87.lib - Library for Nantucket Clipper Summer '87
      RBck_C50.lib - Library for CA-Clipper version 5.0x
      RBck_C52.lib - Library for CA-Clipper version 5.2x

      RBckLib is a Shareware product :

      You have the opportunity to try the program 30 days at no charge
      to see if it meets your needs.
      If you continue to use the program after evaluation,
      please complete the included registration form (RBckLib.REG;
      for DUTCH users: Dutch.REG) and send it with the applicable
      registration fee to the author.

2     COMPRESSION AND DECOMPRESSION ---------------------------------------


2.1   COMPRESSION ALGORITHM -----------------------------------------------

      The compression and decompression functions of RBckLib are based on
      the so-called Lempel-Ziv principle, to be specific the LZW algorithm.
      This base principle is used by almost all famous compression programs
      (as LHARC, ARJ and PKZIP).

      The principle works in short as follows :
      (Sub-)Strings that appear often in the file to compress are being
      replaced by numerical codes.

      While decompressing, these codes are replaced again by the original
      strings.


2.2   QUALITY OF THE COMPRESSION ------------------------------------------

      The compression method used by RBckLib is fast, reliable and gives
      a good compression factor.

      In comparison with the commercial compression programs as PKZIP 2.04
      and ARJ 2.41, RBckLib will score a little less.

      The comparison is not completely fair because PKZIP and ARJ standalone
      programs are with only one goal : compression.
      RBckLib is a part of a complete Clipper application and has to deal
      with less resources (as memory).



3     FUNCTIONS IN RBckLIB ------------------------------------------------

      A complete, detailed description of the functions (with examples)
      can be found in the Norton Guide (RBckLib.NG).
      Both a Clipper 5.xx and a Summer '87 version of the functions is
      described in the Guide.
