INTRODUCTION

Thank you for evaluating our software product.  This
program is actively being maintained.  The product
was thoroughly tested; however, like all software, some 
minor 'bugs' and irritants will inevitably be uncovered 
with its widespread use.  As coding errors and problems 
are reported to us, we will correct them and we will
release regular updates of the software.  If you 
discover a problem, however small, please let us know 
so that we can fix it. If you send us an emal message, 
we will advise you, if and by when the error can be fixed,
or whether it has already been fixed in the latest version.
Upon registration, a master diskette with the latest 
software will be supplied. 
 

INSTALLATION AND SETUP

1.  Start Windows.
2.  Open the Program Manager.
3.  From the File menu, choose Run.
4.  In the Command Line type one of the following:
    -  If the software is on a diskette, type A:SETUP
       (assuming your floppy drive is A:).
    -  If the extracted software is on the hard disk,
        type C:\DIRECTORY\SETUP (where DIRECTORY is
        the actual directory that holds the software
        files).
5.  Choose OK.
6.  Follow the prompts.


IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING THE VBRUN300.DLL

If you are installing the master diskette that you
received after registration, ignore this section;
your diskette includes the VBRUN300.DLL

This program requires the VBRUN300.DLL file. If you 
do not already have this file in your Windows\System 
directory, obtain a free copy of the file from your 
online service, BBS or distributor.
