2     PROGRESS BAR --------------------------------------------------------

      A progress bar is a graphical bar which indicates how far a specific
      process is evaluated.

      The progress bar can be used in almost countless circumstances :

      - While calculating totals, averages, etc ...

      - While copying files

      - While printing reports

      - While printing labels

      - While processing records

      - While indexing files

      - While packing files

      - Etc., etc, ....


      RBarLib makes working with progress bars quite easy :

      Step 1 : Create ( = open ) a bar using the R_OpnBar()-function

      Step 2 : Update the bar while the process is evaluating (R_UpdBar())

      Step 3 : Close ( = remove ) the bar after completion of the process
               (R_ClsBar())
