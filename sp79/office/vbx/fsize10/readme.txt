FormSize v1.0
Copyright (c) 1995 by Dale Nurden
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FormSize is a Visual Basic 3.0 Custom Control which enforces a minimum
and/or maximum size on a resizable form, and also allows the maximized size
and position of the form to be preset by the programmer.

FormSize is Freeware/Shareware, depending on how it is used.  The Windows
help file (FORMSIZE.HLP) contains more information about this, and how to
determine whether you qualify as a Freeware or Shareware user.  FormSize is
not crippled in any way, and contains no registration reminders or nag
screens.  This is because in most cases it will be free for use with no
registration necessary.

The FormSize distribution archive may be freely distributed according to
the conditions specified in the help file.  The help file also contains a
disclaimer for use of the control, and various other information.  Please
read this information before attempting to use FormSize.

Installing FormSize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following files should be included in the distribution package.  If any
are missing, please erase the entire package and obtain a new package from
a more reliable source.

  FILE_ID.DIZ   Package description
  FORMSIZE.VBX  FormSize Custom Control
  FORMSIZE.HLP  Windows Help file for FormSize
  FSDESIGN.EXE  Enables the control for design mode
  README.TXT    This document


To install FormSize, unzip the distribution package into a suitable
directory.  If you have a special directory in which you keep your custom
controls, you can move FORMSIZE.VBX and FORMSIZE.HLP there.  Alternatively,
you can move them into your Windows system directory (usually
C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM).

If you are intending creating your own products which make use of FormSize,
you will need to perform a further installation step to enable the control
to be used in the Visual Basic development environment at design time. This
is explained in the help file (FORMSIZE.HLP) in the section "Installing the
Control".

IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS USING FORMSIZE WITH THE VISUAL BASIC
DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT, PLEASE READ THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH.
