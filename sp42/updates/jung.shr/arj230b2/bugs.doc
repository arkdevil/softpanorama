     You can have input into this version of ARJ.  I would like reports
     on bugs/problems when using this beta version of ARJ 2.30.  I
     would also like comments/suggestions about how the various new
     features function and how you think that they should function.

     I am particularly interested in comments about the "backup"
     features, file SHARE behavior, the critical error handling
     feature, and the text mode processing.

     Please try to report this information by early January 1992.

     I will need to know:

     1)  how to contact you,

     2)  what computer system you are running (configuration, etc.),

     3)  a clear description of the problem,

     4)  what steps reproduce the ARJ error.
