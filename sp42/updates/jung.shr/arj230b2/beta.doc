     This is the BETA_2 test version of ARJ 2.30.  The features in this
     version will most likely be present in the official release.  This
     version is for your testing and evaluation.

     Users of this software may encounter problems which destroy data.
     You must backup your computer before using this software and should
     do so often while using this software.

     This version has been through moderate testing.  However, there
     have been a number of last minute changes to improve ARJ that have
     received only light testing.  Therefore, the use of -jt or -jt2 is
     well advised.

     Please note that is likely that the final release of ARJ 2.30 may
     be slightly different in presentation or switch function.

     Here is a brief synopsis of the most important changes in ARJ.

     The default compression is improved in size and speed in most cases.
     Full file SHARE support is implemented with the option of a critical
     error handler for great stability in a network environment. Move with
     directory delete is now possible.  In addition, ARJ supports
     extraction with deletion (move from) as well as extraction with
     execution.  Multiple volume mode is enhanced with an option to inhibit
     file splitting.  For the ultimate in data integrity, ARJ provides a
     true file compare facility where the contents of an archive can be
     compared against the originals.

     However, one of the major changes involves the ARJ archive itself.
     ARJ now allows multiple versions of the same file in an archive.  The
     duplicates are marked as backup files.  They will not ordinarily show
     but are readily accessible.  This makes using ARJ as a backup utility
     even more convenient.

     If this ARJ beta requires a major fix, I expect to release another
     ARJ beta for public testing.

     I expect to keep improving ARJ both in features, speed, and archive
     size.
