     ARJ 2.22

     This is a fix release for MS-DOS compatibility issues.
     Removed use of clock() [int 1AH].
     Removed use of int 1AH in C0.ASM.
     Removed use of setcbrk() and getcbrk().


     ARJ 2.21a

     ** IMPORTANT NEWS ****************************************************

	ARJ 2.21 does NOT correctly garble (-g option) stored (-m0)
	files larger than 32767 bytes.	ARJed GIFs and archives may have
	this problem, since ARJ reverts to storing when unable to
	compress the file.  Archived files with this problem will
	test/extract with a CRC error.	ARJ 2.21a has an option "-h+" to
	correctly extract such files.

     **********************************************************************

     Fixed garble bug with stored files larger than 32767 bytes.
     Fixed slight inefficiency when extracting stored files.


     ARJ 2.21

     ** IMPORTANT NEWS ****************************************************

	On a very small number of large files, the use of the option
	-jh65535 has resulted in system hangs and file CRC errors.  This
	occurs with the number 65535 and 65534.  If you use this option
	without the -jt option, you should verify your archived files.
	I extend my deepest apologies to everyone so inconvenienced.
	This is fixed in ARJ 2.21.

     **********************************************************************

     Added MS-DOS 3.x international language support so that casing of
	letters is properly handled (such as the "u" with umlaut) on
	the command line and with the ARJ "w" command.
     Speeded up archival operations on diskettes.
     Speeded up store, unstore, and diskette copy operations.
     Speeded up ARJ "w" command.
     Added a default choice of yes to caseless search prompt.
     Added "-jv" option to "s", "p", "w" commands.
     Added "-t1.doc.asm.c" option to select file type by suffix.

     Added several batch files to demonstrate using ARJ to backup/restore
	and using REARJ to convert archives.
     Added a count of files to the ARJ deleting input files messages.
     Added a volume count to "OK to proceed to next volume..." message.
     Slightly improved the compression on -m3 and -m4.
     Modified "ARJ l -jp *.arj" to accept a "n" input to skip archive
	currently being displayed.
     Modified CTL BREAK processing to always delete ARJTEMP.$nn and the
	ARJ archive file when breaking during the temp copying process.
     Modified ARJ to return an ERRORLEVEL of 1 for answering "NO" to
	the "OK to proceed to next volume..." prompt.
     Simplified many of the error messages to avoid confusion.
     Improved the volume size limiting logic to account for
	uncompressible data.
     Fixed problem with "ARJ u -e1" command.
     Fixed rare CTL Break hang problem when DOS BREAK is ON.
     Fixed the ARJ "w" command when the target text spans buffers.
     Fixed the ARJ "c" command to display the correct archive name
	when the archive has been renamed.
     Fixed ARJ file commenting to skip continued files on volumes.
     Fixed a problem with a missing C/R when using "ARJ s -jv".
     Fixed the diskette processing when the diskette is swapped during
	the lack of disk space user prompt.
     Fixed ARJ attempt to open file named "*.ARJ" for add commands.
     Fixed midnight date problem caused by clock() and DOS bug.
     Fixed ARJ.DOC to indicate that ARJ <command> *.ARJ works for all
	ARJ commands except for the add commands (a, f, j, m, u).
     Fixed rare ARJ error when using -jh65535 with certain files.
     Fixed "ARJ e archive ... -zcomment.txt" to not abort for 0 files.
     Fixed ARJ to handle file attributes on directories correctly.
     Fixed ARJ "Out of memory" error when using "-jm" and ARJ_SW.
     Fixed "-jyy" option handling of "function" key inputs.
     Modified "-jyy" to display input character in original case.
     Fixed "-?" to work with "-jyy".
     Fixed ARJ to abort on reaching end of file early when using STDIN.
     Fixed ARJ processing of empty list files to not display errors.
     Fixed ARJ to delay aborting on updating an ARJ-SECURED archive so a
	command like "ARJ c *.ARJ -r -zBBS.TXT" does not end prematurely.
     Slightly revised LICENSE.DOC and ORDERFRM.DOC.

     Significantly speeded up self-extraction from diskettes.

     Verified that QSORT by Ben Baker will work with ARJSORT.BAT without
	the memory limitation problem of MS-DOS SORT.
     Fixed ARJSORT to allow -! in ARJ_SW.
     Fixed ARJSORT pause when user has set -jp in ARJ_SW.
     Fixed ARJSORT to detect errors in MS-DOS SORT processing.

     Modified REARJ.CFG to not allow full directory extractions for PAK.
     Modified REARJ to remove the temp directory between conversions.
     Added REARJ "/u" usage information to "/a*" usage to REARJ.DOC.
     Changed REARJ.CFG to support Viruscan version 80.
     Improved REARJ CTL Break handling using PKZIP/UNZIP.
