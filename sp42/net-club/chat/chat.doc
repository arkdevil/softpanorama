          An easy-to-use on-line messager between two Novell LAN 
          connections (users).   Public   Domain.  Netbios   not
          required.

          Network manager should  install  CHAT.EXE somewhere in 
          the general search path. After that, Chat is ready for 
          use,  and  users  need  only  to  type CHAT at the DOS 
          prompt to access  Chat.  Chat's  menu-based  selection 
          system  can  also  be   bypassed   via   command  line 
          instructions. For details, see Chat's own help (F1).

          All comments and suggestions for  further  development 
          are appreciated.
