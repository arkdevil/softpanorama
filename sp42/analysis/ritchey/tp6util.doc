TPCONFIG.EXE
============
TPCONFIG is a utility program that performs the same function as the
Borland program by the same name that was included with versions of
Turbo Pascal prior to 6.0.

This utility will take your IDE configuration file (TURBO.TP) and create
a configuration file (TPC.CFG) for use with the command line compiler.
It will also take as input a TPC.CFG file and update your TURBO.TP file
to reflect the options contained in the TPC.CFG file.

Note that TURBO.TP and TPC.CFG are the default names. TPCONFIG will
allow you to override these defaults.





TPUINFO.EXE
===========
TPUINFO is a utility that will list various facts concerning .TPU files
created by Turbo Pascal v. 6.0. TPUINFO will accept wild cards allowing
a listing of multiple .TPU files within a directory.  A sample execution
of TPUINFO would be:

C>TPUINFO d:\TURBO\TVISION
TPUInfo version 6.0  Copyright (C) 1990, J.P. Ritchey

Unit         Flags     Init    Code    Data  Actual Name
--------  ------------  ---  ------  ------  -----------
OBJECTS   $N-,O+,D-,L-         8298     456
DRIVERS   $N-,O-,D-,L-  Yes    2775     734

TEXTVIEW  $N-,O+,D-,L-         2495     304

The "Unit" column is the name of the .TPU as it is found on disk. This
could differ from the name as it is known to Turbo Pascal. When the
external name differs from the internal name, the internal name is
listed in the column titled "Actual Name".

The "Flags" column lists the state of those compiler options that are
detectable by a simple inspection of a .TPU file.

The "Init" column will contain "Yes" if the unit contains initialization
code.

The "Code" column indicates the number of bytes of code contained within
the .TPU.  Note that due to smart linking, the actual amount of code in
a program that uses the unit could be smaller.

The "Data" column indicates the number of bytes of data (both
initialized and unitialized) contained within the .TPU. Once again, due
to smart linking this is the maximum amount of data segment space that
will be used by this unit.

TPUINFO has a command line option, Verbose (enabled by specifying /v on
the command line), that will list the source and object files used to
create the .TPU in addition to the information listed when /Verbose is
not specified.  An example follows:

C>TPUINFO D:\TURBO\TVISION\DRIVERS /v
TPUInfo version 6.0  Copyright (C) 1990, J.P. Ritchey

Unit         Flags     Init    Code    Data  Actual Name
--------  ------------  ---  ------  ------  -----------
DRIVERS   $N-,O-,D-,L-  Yes    2775     734
          PAS  11/05/90 06:00:00a  DRIVERS.PAS
          OBJ                      SYSINT.OBJ
          OBJ                      FORMAT.OBJ


CPUCHK.PAS
==========
With the addition of the $G option in Turbo Pascal 6.0, code can be
generated that uses instructions available on the 80286 or later CPUs.
There is no check to see if a machine supports 80286 instructions when
a program is run. With the addition of CPUCHK as the first entry in your
program's uses list, the initialization code of CPUCHK will determine if
the target machine is 8088 or 8086 based and fail with a run-time error
number 215 if the machine doesn't support 80286 instructions.
