
    To make proper installation of Prolog-plus demo do follow:

    Run INSTALL.EXE with paramiter - path you want Prolog-plus demo
    to be installed on (e.g. A:\>INSTALL.EXE D:\DEMO\PROLOG).

    There is another, 'manual' way:

 1. Create Prolog-plus demo work directory on your hard disk (e.g.
    D:\DEMO\PROLOG).

 2. Copy INSTALL.EXE to the work directiry has been created.

 3. Run INSTALL.EXE from the work directory.

    The Prolog-plus demo is self-extracted archive, it will create
    environment automatically.

P.S.
   To use Prolog-plus without demo rename PROLOG.DMO or delete it.
