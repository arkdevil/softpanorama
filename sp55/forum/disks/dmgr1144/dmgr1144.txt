                       ST1144A INSTALLATION


!WARNING! - DO NOT LOW-LEVEL FORMAT OR INITIALIZE THE ST1144A
DRIVE. DOING SO WILL DELETE IMPORTANT FACTORY-WRITTEN DEFECT
INFORMATION. THE ST1144A HAS ALREADY BEEN INITIALIZED AT THE
FACTORY.

---------------------------------------------------------

Pure DOS installation for the ST1144A:

If your system has the capability of a "Custom" or "User
Definable" CMOS drive type (often type 47), set it up as 1001
cyls, 15 heads, 1002 reduced write current, 1002 write
precompensation cylinder, 1002 landing zone (drive is AutoPark),
and 17 sector per track. Then go straight to the DOS utility
FDISK to partition the drive, and finish the installation with
the DOS FORMAT command. See you DOS manual for instructions for
FDISK and FORMAT.

If your system does not have the "User Definable" drive type,
and you wish to maintain a pure DOS environment, your choices
are limited to selecting drive type 9 (117,504,000 bytes),
drive type 41 (119,723,520 bytes), or getting a BIOS upgrade
with either direct support for the drive or with "User Definable"
drive types.

DISK MANAGER INSTALLATION FOR THE ST1144A:

The DISK MANAGER preparation software may be used to get the full
capacity (130,690,560 bytes) from the drive as a NONSTANDARD
drive not supported by the BIOS drive type table.


1. In the CMOS setup, select drive type 9 (900 cylinders, 15
heads, and 17 sectors per track = 117,504,000 bytes) which is
common for most BIOS's.

2. Using a bootable floppy diskette, boot to the A: drive.

3. Start the Disk Manager program in the MANUAL MODE by typing
at the A: prompt DM/M.

4. At the top of the screen, you should see the parameters from
the CMOS setup as 899 cyls, 15 heads and 17 sectors (one of the
cylinders is always given away as the CE or Customer Engineering
cylinder for read/write tests).

5. From the main menu, select (P)artitioning menu and proceed to
build a (N)ew partition table. The first partition is a DOS
bootable and any others are Write/Read. After all cylinders are
allocated, save the partition record and Prepare all
DOS/Write-Read partitions. Disk Manager will ask for you to place
the bootable DOS diskette is drive A: when the time comes to copy
the system files and command.com to the root directory of the C:
drive. When the preparation of all the partitions is completed,
there will also be a CONFIG.SYS file (with device = DMDRVR.BIN)
and a driver file called DMDRVR.BIN in the root directory of the
C: drive.

6. The system should now boot, load the DMDRVR.BIN and display
the Disk Manager banner, and come to the C: prompt. The total
number of megabytes is equal to the CMOS drive type definition of
117,504,000 bytes. The ST1144A can be brought up to full capacity
by the creation of an auxiliary file called PARM1.FIL.

7. Modify the CONFIG.SYS file:

    from: device = dmdrvr.bin
      to: device = dmdrvr.bin parm1.fil parm2.fil

PARM1.FIL and PARM2.FIL are DRIVE PARAMETER FILES. Create with the
"COPY CON PARM1.FIL" command. The contents of the PARM1.FIL for the
ST1144A should look like this: 1001,15,1002,1002,0,8,0,0,0,1002,17,1

This configuration yields 130,690,560 bytes.

If you use the COPY CON command, use a ^Z (control-Z) to close and
save the file.

These 2 files must, of course, exist on the boot device. Also,
note that if you have only a 1 drive system, the "device ="
statement in CONFIG.SYS still must contain 2 file names. They may,
however, both be the same filename:

     device = dmdrvr.bin parm1.fil parm1.fil

8. Now that the PARM1.FIL has been created containing the
parameters for the ST1144A, and the CONFIG.SYS file has been
modified, the system is ready to be rebooted.

9. Switch over to the A: drive and start the Disk Manager program
in the MANUAL MODE by typing at the A: prompt DM/M.

10. At the top of the screen, you should see the parameters from
the device driver as 1000 cyls, 15 heads and 17 sectors. From the
main menu select (C)onfiguration menu and then (W)rite
configuration record to disk. (R)eturn to the main menu.

11. From the main menu, select (P)artitioning menu and proceed to
(M)odify the partition table. The partition record should look
the same as before with the addition of 100 more cylinders left
to (A)llocate as a Write/Read partition. The first partition is a
DOS bootable and any others are Write/Read. After the last 100
cylinders are allocated, save the partition record and Prepare
all newly allocated partitions.

Note: You could also change partitioning information by deleting
the existing Write/Read partitions (NOT the DOS partition), from
last to first, and then recreating the partition structure
sequentially, first to last. Then save the partition record and
Prepare all newly allocated Write/Read partitions.  It is a good
idea to do a Printscreen of the partitioning table.


12. The system should now boot, load the DMDRVR.BIN PARM1.FIL and
display the Disk Manager banner, and come to the C: prompt with
full capacity for the ST1144A.
