The FINDTYPE.EXE program is designed to aid in the integration of
a Seagate disc drive into an AT compatible computer system.

This program is designed to benefit those without an extensive
technical background as well as those more experienced systems
integrators.

                         DESCRIPTION



The purpose of this program is to help a systems integrator or
end-user to install a Seagate disc drive into any AT type computer.
The program reads the system BIOS to determine which drive types are
supported. If an exact match is found, the program will display the
correct type so that this information may be used in the computer's
CMOS setup program.

If an exact match is not found, the program will scan the BIOS
and select a drive type which will most efficiently use the
capacity of the drive being installed. It will also calculate the
percentage of utilization with the selected drive type. The
precompensation start track and reduced write current start track are
also compared and if an exact match cannot be found, the closest one
will be selected.

Some BIOS will support a custom or user defined drive type; if
available, it is usually drive type 47 or 48.  This allows the user to
input the number of cylinders, heads and sectors. This CUSTOM drive
type may be used when the closest type supported by the BIOS gives
less than 100% utilization of the drive. The program has the ability
to scan the BIOS for support of CUSTOM drive type. If that support is
detected, you will be prompted to that effect. However, refer to the
documentation for your computer to verify that support and for drive
parameter entry instructions.

In the case of ZBR (Zone Bit Recorded) drives, for AT(ide) interface
drives the true physical parameters cannot be set in CMOS, therefore
the suggested translation is only given. For SCSI drives that are ZBR,
an average of the Sectors per Track is given and is rounded down from
its actual value to a whole number.

Note: A "custom" or "user-definded" drive type may ask for a numerical
value for the Write Precompensation cylinder and for the Landing Zone
cylinder.  A basic rule-of-thumb for drive models that do not require
the old Write Precomp technique or a Landing Zone because they are
Auto-Parking is to add 1 to the cylinder value being used. As an
example: If cylinders equaled 820, then Write Precomp and Landing Zone
would be entered as 821.

============================
The FindTYPE ver. 1.21 program has the ability to reset the drive type
number in CMOS. After you have highlighted your drive model, read the
online information that pertains to your interface, and considered the
ramifications of changing the drive type in CMOS (which you DO NOT
WANT TO DO if there is data on the drive), then by pressing 0 for the
first physical drive or 1 for the second physical drive you begin the
reset process. There are Y/N prompts along the way to allow you to
abort this process. After the drive type has been reset, the system
will reboot as the program is exited.

============================

When installing AT interface (IDE) drives with more than 1024
cylinders and using a BIOS that supports a custom drive type, the
program can calculate the optimum translation parameters for the drive
being installed.

If you are installing a drive which is not supported by the BIOS,
and the BIOS does not support the CUSTOM or USER DEFINED drive
type, you have four options:

1. Use a controller with a ROM Bios on-board that will support
the interface being used.

2. Replace the system BIOS with one that supports the drive or that
supports a CUSTOM drive type.

3. Use a third party software package, such as Disk Manager, to
install the drive and provide a device driver solution.

4. Use the closest drive type which is supported by your BIOS and
achieve only partial utilization of the capacity of the drive. You may
find that the percentage of utilization is acceptable.


There are also options which allow the printing of the system
BIOS drive tables and a list of parameters for Seagate drives.

Help screen notes for Findtype v1.21    F1 from the Main Menu


"Find the BEST 'Standard' or 'Custom' Type"

This selection will display, on the right hand side of the screen, a
column of Seagate disc drive model numbers. Using the up/down arrow
keys, highlight the model of your choice and the two other boxes will
display specific information about that drive. This information
includes the Seagate model #, old Imprimis model # (if applicable),
the interface, form factor (size), true physical drive geometry, a
'custom' translation geometry (only for AT interface drives), and the
BEST 'standard' drive type number from your system's BIOS. You should
ALWAYS double check the number from inside the CMOS setup, as some odd
BIOS's have caused the numbering to be off by 1.

When you have highlighted the model of your choice, you can press the
Enter key to pop-up additional information that pertains to your drive
and the setting drive types for that particular interface.

As the program was started, FindTYPE made an attempt to determine
whether or not a 'custom' or 'user definable' drive exists in your
system BIOS.  If it was found, a "tweedle" tone was given.  It is VERY
important to note that this search for a 'user definable' drive type
is not foolproof; rarely, at times, a 'user definable' might get
missed or indicated as found when it really isn't.


"Output the BIOS Drive Type Table"

This selection will "output" to your choice of three devices: screen,
printer, or drive (save as a file).  The result is a listing of your
system's BIOS Drive Type Table. This is a simple read function.


"Output Seagate Drive Parameters"

This selection will "output" to your choice of three devices: screen,
printer, or drive (save as a file). The result is a listing of all
Seagate disc drives and specifications that are supported by this
version of FindTYPE.

"Display Seagate Model # Information"

This selection will display an "anatomy" chart of Seagate model
numbers. This chart will describe the various components that make up
a Seagate model number.
