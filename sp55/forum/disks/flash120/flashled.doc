=====Intro==================

FlashLED is a very small TSR (Terminate and Stay Resident in memory)
utility that uses the LED's (Light Emitting Diode) found on AT
keyboards and, optionally, the system speaker to indicate disc drive
activity.

Normally, the activity lights found on the front faceplates of the
disc drive and/or the system chasis are more than adequate for
displaying activity, however, many of today's smaller drives are
mounted deep within the systems, obscuring any view of the drive's own
LED (if it even has one). Also, many computer systems are of the
"tower" type, taking them off the desk, which requires the user to
look down at the floor for activity lights. In either case, FlashLED,
can help by putting the activity light "at your finger tips."

=====Syntax=Summary========

The command line syntax of FlashLED is:

        FLASHLED [/options]

The default behavior, if no command line arguments are specified, is
to display a "not installed" screen which offers the /? switch as a
suggestion for command line options:

        | The option switches are:
        |
        |    Select ONE of the keyboard LED options (or not) :
        |       /N   Num Lock
        |       /C   Caps Lock
        |       /S   Scroll Lock
        |       /K   Kill keyboard LED activity (FlashLED will not
        |             indicate activity on the keyboard, so, hopefully,
        |             you will be selecting the speaker option [/P])
        |
        |    Additionally, select ONE of the disc drive options:
        |       /F   Floppy drives only
        |       /H   Hard drives only
        |       /B   Both floppy and hard disc drives
        |
        |    Optionally select one of these, if you like:
        |       /P   sPeaker "click" with drive activity (low
        |             frequency is READ, high frequency is WRITE)
        |       /?   Display all of these options to the screen,
        |             without loading the program. (overrides any
        |             other command line arguments)

Multiple command line argument switches may be specified together or
seperately. The following examples are functionally equivalent:

           FLASHLED /S /H /P
           flashled /shp  (DOS nor FlashLED is case sensitive)
       (this space ^ must be there)

=====Outline================

An brief outline of how FlashLED works is as follows:

A. FlashLED Disc Drive Activity from Keyboard LED program
   1. Display program instructions and take user input of
      configuration parameters
      a) determine the current status of the keyboard LED's and save
         that status then turn off all the LED's
      b) wait for the user's selection of which keyboard LED should
         indicate the activity (Num, Caps or Scroll Lock)
      c) If it's not an LED that was ALREADY in use before the
         program was started, then great, otherwise default to the
         Scroll Lock LED.
      d) wait for the user's selection of which drive devices (hard,
         floppy or both) should reflect activity to the LED
      e) wait for user's selection on activity "clicking" the speaker
   2. terminate and stay resident
   3. program "watches" for activity on DOS interrupt 13 (disk
      services)
      a) if "observed", then LED and/or speaker is turned on
      b) when INT 13 concludes, LED is turned off after a few DOS
         INT 1C timer ticks (18.2 ticks per second)
   4. program removed from memory by a system reset or TSR
      management utility

=====App=Notes==============


Some Application Notes:

  1. The effect of the program on the performance of the system is
negligible.

  2. When the speaker "click" sound option is activated, other
programs which beep on errors will usually get their chance but then
the beep frequency is lowered again to the level defined by FlashLED.

  3. The use of FlashLED on XT's is disallowed, since keyboard LED's
are not defined in that host environment.

  4. In Windows (tm), the keyboard LED activity is suspended but the
speaker click still works. When Windows is exited, the keyboard LED
activity returns.

  5. Since FlashLED uses INT 1C (timer tick), some TSR screen clocks
may not allow FlashLED to work properly. Try reversing the loading
order of the TSR's.

  6. When disk caching software is in use, FlashLED may indicate
activity when data is drawn from the cache (AKA a cache hit).

  7. There will be times when the keyboard activity LED doesn't seem
to keep on pace with the activity of the drive. This is due to the
fact that the bios keyboard services are given LOW priority; since the
system figures that the user is probably the slowest component in the
system, it doesn't come looking as often. As a result, FlashLED will
tend to "even out" the rapid flicker of an busy drive's activity light
and show a steady, even glow on the LED. If the speaker option [/p]
has been selected, the "click" will easily keep up with the activity.

  8. As mentioned earlier, FlashLED is a tiny TSR (at 560 bytes). When
a TSR is kept in memory, the total amount of memory space that it
takes is the sum of itself and the DOS environment active at the time
of the load.  Since many of us use a "PATH=" which is max'd out, a
"PROMPT=" which is complex and a "SET=" for everything under the sun,
our environment size gets pretty BIG!  To minimize the environment
"impact" on the TSR, try getting the TSR's loaded and tucked in,
first, then build up the environment variables.

  9. FlashLED will not see the activity of a network drive since
different interrupts are being used.

 10. Some SCSI host adapters are bundled with device drivers which do
not use INT 13, in which case the FlashLED program will not work.
This may also be true for some partitioning software.

 11. If the program is started with /shp (scroll lock, hard drives
only, speaker on), and then loaded again with /cf (caps lock, floppy
only) the LED's will switch between scroll and caps, depending on hard
or floppy drive access.
