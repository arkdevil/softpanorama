  OVERVIEW

  DLGDSN takes some of the pain out of designing dialog boxes for Borland's 
  new Turbo Vision package.  With DLGDSN, dialog views can be easily added, 
  edited, rearranged, and the dialogbox itself sized, moved, etc.  Once the 
  design is satisfactory, DLGDSN can produce source code for the dialogbox to 
  be included in your program. 


  REQUIREMENTS

    Borland's C++ version 2.0 or later
    Borland's Turbo Vision package
    A mouse is desirable

  The following files are supplied:

  DLGDSNC.EXE    The design program
  DLGHLPC.HLP    Online help file
  DLGDSNC.DOC    This one
  TESTCASE.CPP   A test program to check the source code produced by DLGDSN


  DESIGNING A DIALOG BOX

  DLGDSN has three modes of operation:

    Design Mode

    DLGDSN begins in design mode and this is the mode that you use for all 
    layout work and editing.  In design mode, the dialogbox doesn't look or 
    act quite like it will in the final design.  For one thing, there is a 
    'canvas' background which helps show the actual space occupied by the 
    views.  Also, to facilitate editing, all views can be selected using the 
    mouse or tab key though some won't be selectable in an actual dialogbox.

    Try Mode

    Try mode is entered using the F9 key.  In try mode, the dialogbox behaves 
    as it's supposed to.  You can check the Tab order, make temporary 


                                      1











    entries, and push buttons to actually check how things will work.  Exit 
    try mode with the escape key or click on the close box.

    Ordering Mode

    Ordering mode allows you to change the Tab order of your dialogbox.  The 
    method for doing this is discussed further below.  The F8 key toggles you 
    into and out of ordering mode.

  While there is no fixed way to design a dialogbox, here's one suggested 
  sequence:

  1.In design mode, work with the dialogbox fully zoomed.

  2.From the Add menu, select a view to add.  This will bring up a dialogbox 
    where you can enter the necessary information.  Use the online help (F1 
    key) if you have a question as to what goes in a particular field.  When 
    the OK button is pushed, the view will appear somewhere in the (fully 
    zoomed) design box.  The view is then positioned by dragging it with the 
    mouse, or by using the arrow keys (Shift+arrow moves a little faster).  
    Work in the upper left corner of the box.

  3.Continue adding views as desired.  At any time, views can be repositioned 
    with the mouse or arrow keys.  If something other than position needs 
    changing, select the view and from the Edit menu choose Edit Selected (or 
    use F7).  This will bring up its dialogbox for changes.

  4.When all the views have been added and positioned, size the box to fit 
    and move it to the desired location on the desktop.  Be sure and add a 
    title (Dialog Title from the Edit menu).

  5.Enter Try Mode with the F9 key and test the dialogbox.  Be sure to check 
    how the views sequence using the Tab key.  Exit Try mode with Esc or 
    click on the close box.

  6.If the Tab sequence needs changing, use F8 to enter ordering mode.  With 
    the mouse, click on each view to establish the desired order.   Exit back 
    to design mode with F8.

    Changing the sequence without a mouse is a little more complicated.  Use 
    the Tab key to select (highlight) the next view to be sequenced.  Then 
    press the Enter key to enter the selected view into the sequence.  After 
    all views have been entered, exit back to design mode with F8.

    Some views (such as Static Text, Labels, Scrollbars) don't enter into the 
    tab sequence of a dialogbox.  You can order these if it's convenient, but 
    the order won't effect the final results.  

    Be sure to recheck the tab order in Try mode.





                                      2











  7.This is a good time to save your work.  Choose Save or Save As from the 
    File menu to create or update a .DLG file.  Any file with the same name 
    will be renamed with a .BKP extension.

  8.To create source code for your dialogbox, choose Write Source from the 
    Operations menu and choose a filename (.SRC is the default extension).  
    The source code produced will consist of a dialogbox definition function 
    and a data record with fields matching those required by the dialogbox's 
    SetData and GetData methods.

    The .SRC file generated may be inserted directly into TESTCASE.CPP (at 
    the line of asterisks) to provide a program to test the dialogbox.


  SOME DETAILS

  Class Names

  Many of the Add/Edit dialogboxes have a field labeled 'Class Name'.  By 
  default, this field contains the standard Turbo Vision name for the view.  
  This field exists for situations where it may be desirable to use a derived 
  view which doesn't differ much from its standard view parent.  The class 
  name entered here will be the one used when generating the source code for 
  the dialogbox.  

  Help Context

  Many of the Add/Edit dialogboxes also have fields labeled Help Context and
  Value.  By default, these contain hcNoContext and 0.  DLGDSN uses the help 
  context ID when generating source code and the value when producing a 
  resource.

  For small projects, it may be convenient just to enter this information by 
  hand.  However, if you're using Borland's demo help compiler, TVHC, DLGDSN 
  can work with the help definition file it produces.  To do this, choose 
  Load Help ctx file from the Options menu and supply the filename of the 
  help definition file.  Then clicking on the '*' box next to the help 
  context field (or typing '*' in the field) will bring up a pick list of the 
  definitions from which to choose.

  CHANGES

  Vers 1.1  Fixed crash when Try mode toggled and no views present.
  Vers 1.2  Added C++ source compile option.  Minor fixes.
  Vers 1.3  Fixed another crash bug.  Fixed insufficient heap problem for 
            complex boxes.  COMMAND.COM need no longer be in root directory to 
            shell to DOS.
