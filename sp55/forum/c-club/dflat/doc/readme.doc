D-Flat Version 9

The source files in the DFLAT archive constitute the D-Flat windowing
system. This is public domain code. You may use it in your
applications without restriction. You may freely distribute source
code. It would be nice if you would give credit to Dr. Dobb's Journal
as the original publisher of the source code.

The software build procedure makes a program named memopad.exe. It is
a multiple-document notepad program. Observe the #define VERSION
statement in dflat.h. The version number should correspond with the n
in the DFLATn.ARC and DFnTXT.ARC filenames that you downloaded. Check
the uploads periodically to see if there is a more recent version
available.

My CompuServe ID is 71101,1262. I monitor the DDJFORUM every day and
prefer that you discuss D-Flat there so that every one can benefit
from your comments.

======== Turbo C 2.0 =========

To build with the Turbo C 2.0 make utility:

Set the DRIVE macro in makefile.tc2 to the drive where your compiler
is installed.

Type this command:

    C>make -fmakefile.tc2

============== Microsoft C 6.0

To build with the Microsoft C nmake utility, make the first
lines of the makefile look like this:

    MSC = 1
    BORLAND_CPP = 0

Set the DRIVE macro in the makefile to the drive where your compiler
is installed.

Type this command:

    C>nmake

========== Borland C++ 2.0 ============

To build with the Borland C++ 2.0 make utility, make the first 
lines of the makefile look like this:

    MSC = 0
    BORLAND_CPP = 1

Set the DRIVE macro in the makefile to the drive where your compiler
is installed.

Type this command:

    C>make

========== WATCOM C 8.0 ============

To build with Watcom C 8.0, type this command

    C>wmake /f makefile.wat

=======================================================

D-Flat uses Compressed help files. It uses an adaptation of the
Huffman compression programs from the Dr. Dobb's Journal C
Programming Column of early 1991. If the program finds the compressed
MEMOPAD.HLP, it loads it. Otherwise, it looks for MEMOPAD.TXT, the
ASCII version of the file, and loads that file instead. When you
execute the Reload Help command on the Help menu, the program loads
the same way. To test changes to the help file that you make from the
MEMOPAD program, delete the MEMOPAD.HLP file so that the reload
command loads the MEMOPAD.TXT file. You can compress MEMOPAD.TXT into
MEMOPAD.HLP later. The program starts faster without compressed
help.

To compress the help file type this on the command line:

   C>huffc memopad.txt memopad.hlp

===============================================

This is version 9. It includes these improvements:

1. Added the SETTEXTLENGTH message. It sets the maximum length of an
EDITBOX's text buffer. The Filename field on the file open and file
save dialog boxes now allow only 64 characters input. 

2. Fixed some problems with PutWindowLine where it overwrote some
overlapping windows.
