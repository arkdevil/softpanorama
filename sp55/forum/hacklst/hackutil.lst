         ===== Utilities for use with the HACK????.COL File =====

Several utilities now exist that read the columnar filename list (the
HACK????.COL file, where ???? is the same month/year as that used in the
filename of The Hack Report).  These files perform different functions, so
you might want to experiment with each to find the one that suits your
needs as either a SysOp or as a BBS User.

This list is by no means complete:  there are possibly more out there, but
these are just some that I am aware of.  If I have left any programs out,
please contact me and let me know.

THE FILES LISTED BELOW ARE NOT WARRANTED OR GUARANTEED BY THE AUTHOR OF THE
HACK REPORT, LEE JACKSON, NOR DOES THE INCLUSION OF A FILE IN THE LIST
BELOW CONSTITUTE AN ENDORSEMENT OF THE PROGRAM IN QUESTION.  ANY WARRANTIES
OR GUARANTEES OF PERFORMANCE, FITNESS FOR USE, OR OTHER CLAIMS FOR THESE
FILES ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AUTHOR OF EACH PROGRAM.  THE
AUTHOR OF THE HACK REPORT, LEE JACKSON, WILL NOT ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR
AND WILL NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE AND/OR MISUSE
OF THESE FILES, WHETHER ALONE OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH ANYTHING WRITTEN BY
LEE JACKSON.

In other words, use them at your own risk. :-)  I've tested some of them,
but not all.
