   This documents the user visible changes to ARJ from previous versions.


   ARJ 1.00

   ***IMPORTANT CHANGES***************************************************

      Changed the default for "-t" to binary to avoid user problems.
      Use the "-t1" option to force text mode compression.  Use of
      "-t1" with "-jh65000" on larger text files will often produce
      even better size reduction.

   ***********************************************************************

   Fixed "-vas" option to work correctly.
   Fixed extraction to a disk with a volume name the same as the directory.
   Fixed ARJ to report an error when trying to update readonly archives.
   Fixed memory allocation usage with switch "-js" again.
   Fixed "-o" option to work on "e", "l", "x", "p", "w", "s" commands.
   Fixed description of header and timestamp in AV.C and TECHNOTE.DOC.
   Added "p1" switch option to facilitate the extraction of directories.
   Added SFXJR module (less than 6000 bytes) via "-je1" switch.
   Added "-b2" switch to only reset archive bits.
   Added "O" command to allow the ordering of files within an archive.
   Provided ARJSORT.BAT command.
   Added "-jv" and "-jv1" options to "v" command for ARJSORT support.
   Added "-jd" switch to allow checking of disk space before extraction.
   Added "-jh" switch to set Huffman buffer size for improving compression.
   Added AT&T UNIX compatibility to AV.C source code.
   Improved speed of SFX module.
   Increased the read buffer size to 2048 when inputting a comment file.
   Modified SFX module not to hang system when console is in RAW mode.
   Made the "-jc" option the default mode.
   Improved "-jt" command by closing destination file to force disk flush
      before testing destination file.
   Slightly speeded up methods 3 and 4.


   ARJ 0.20

   ***IMPORTANT CHANGES***************************************************

      The problem of an update to an ARJ archive including itself in the
      add has been resolved.  Because of the fix, you can no longer "a",
      "f", "m", "u" to a wildnamed archive.  ARJ a *.ARJ *.C is not valid
      anymore.  This also fixes the problem of a move command sometimes
      deleting the archive itself.

      For users of RAW.COM (raw console mode), ARJ now has a "-jc" switch
      to check for RAW mode and to switch to cgets() instead of fgets()
      which hangs in RAW mode.  This switch may become the default if it
      proves stable.

      The "-x" switch is changed.  It now is used as the exclude selected
      filenames switch.  The create self-Extractor switch is now "-je".

      The "-d"elete switch has been changed so that ARJ will prompt for
      permission to delete the successfully added files.  You can
      disable the prompt with the "-y" switch or you can use the "m"ove
      command instead.

      The "-s" switch will work with non-update commands now like "l".

      ARJ now supports the use of either "-" or "/" as the switch option
      character.  The first occurrence of either "-" or "/" that ARJ
      encounters will determine the switch symbol.  You may not mix and
      match switch symbols.  This also includes the ARJ_SW environment
      variable.  ARJ_SW is checked first for switches.

      Increasing the size of the comment input buffer to 2048 bytes and
      25 lines can cause problems with versions of ARJ earlier than
      0.15a.  Unpredictable results will result from using an earlier
      version of ARJ to process an ARJ archive with comments longer than
      1024 bytes.  All users should upgrade to 0.20 as soon as possible.
      Archives produced by all ARJ releases are fully compatible with
      ARJ 0.20.  This comment size problem also affects the use of the
      AV.EXE program.  Users of AV.EXE should upgrade to the 1.10
      version.

   ***********************************************************************

   Fixed the problem of an update to an archive including itself.
   This also fixed the problem of a move command sometimes deleting the
      archive itself.
   Fixed the problem with memory usage and the "-js" switch.
   Improved the Huffman encoding and decoding routines.
   Improved the wildcard mechanism.
   Improved the recursion mechanism to work with non-wildnames.
   Improved "-s" to work with non-update commands.
   Improved volume sizing.
   Removed ".ARJ" suffix check for "-v" usage.
   Added "-vv" switch to beep terminal between volumes.
   Added support of both "/" and "-" as switch characters.
   Added "-jc" switch to check for RAW console mode.
   Added "-e1" switch to allow exclusion of the base directory name.
   Increased the speed of methods 3 and 4 to PKZIP like speed.
   Changed the create self-extractor switch to "-je".
   Changed "-d" switch to prompt for permission to delete files.
   Removed pause from "l" and "v" commands.
   Made the add, extract, test displays less verbose.
   Split help function into brief help and detailed help.
   Added system command option to "-v" switch to allow formatting,
      deleting, etc on target diskettes.
   Added "-jt" switch which causes ARJ to test the new temporary archive
      before it overwrites the original archive.  When using a working
      directory, ARJ will test the copy operation.  In the "m" command,
      ARJ does these test(s) before deleting any files.
   Added "-jr" recover switch to help recover data from damaged archives.
   Added "-jf" full path switch to allow drive and root to be stored.
   Added "-jp" pause switch to pause "l" and "v" commands.
   Added "-x" exclude switch to exclude filenames from processing.
   Added "-jv" verbose switch to display more information during "e", "t",
      "a", "f", "u", and "x" commands.
   Added "-jk" switch to keep the temporary archive after an abort.  On a
      disk full error, the partial temporary archive will usually be usable.
   Increased archive comment size to 2048 bytes and 25 lines.


   ARJ 0.15a

   Fixed problem with getting a disk space error when extracting from a
      floppy disk using the -v option.
   Fixed the erase comment sequence to completely erase comment.
   Slightly (10%) speeded up extraction of files.


   ARJ 0.15

   ***IMPORTANT CHANGES***************************************************

      A bug in the -g option with certain stored files requires the ARJ
      0.15 -jg option to extract.

      Method 4 compression has been improved, but it is NOT compatible
      with earlier versions of method 4.  However, ARJ 0.15 will still
      test and extract old method 4 files correctly, but future versions
      of ARJ may not have that capability.  ARJ never by default chooses
      method 4 to compress.

   ***KNOWN ISSUES********************************************************

      When updating an existing archive, ARJ does not eliminate the
      archive from wildcard inclusion.  For example, ARJ u archive *.*
      will add archive.arj to itself if archive.arj already exists.

   ***********************************************************************

   Changed extended position switch from -x to -jx.
   Changed -h option to -ja.
   Removed expiration date function.
   Improved the information displayed during compression.
   Added switch option of "--" to indicate no more switches to process.

      certain stored garbled files.
   Added more features to "-v" switch like auto-space-detect.
   Added Move command.
   Added Remove paths command.
   Archive extraction is faster.
   ARJ -m1 compresses slightly better than ARJ 0.14 -m1.
   Added self-extraction feature to ARJ.EXE with -x switch.
   Added capability to process and update self-extracting archives.
   Added generic path processing to facilitate cross-platform archive
      processing.
   Fixed ..\path processing.
   ARJ will NOT abort on an add failure but will report an error count.
   Added -j to select alternate switch characters.
   Added -js option to store archive files instead of compressing them.
   Fixed comment option to allow display of IBM block graphics.
   Added -ob (before date) to go along with -o.
   Improved -m4 compression in size reduction.


   ARJ 0.14

   Added multiple volume archive capability.
   Added dumping of list of filenames to be processed to a list file.
   Added multiple string searching through archives.
   Added extra flags to list command output regarding paths, garbled files,
      and split files.
   Increased file processing capacity to 16000 from 1024.
   Increased *.ARJ capacity to 8000 from 1024.
   Added multiple line comments with option comment input from a file.
   Modified comment display to not display escape characters by default.
   Added switch to allow display of ANSI comments.
   Added pause to help screen.
   Added option to "-b" switch to allow the choice of resetting archive
      bits.
