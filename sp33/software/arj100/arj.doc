     ***IMPORTANT NEWS*****************************************************

        Previous users of ARJ should read the WHATSNEW.DOC!!!  It contains
        important information about changes and issues since test releases
        0.13a, 0.14, 0.15, 0.15a, and 0.20.

     **********************************************************************


     INTRODUCTION:

        ARJ is my first attempt to use my interest in compression
        technology to produce an archiver for personal use on my PC and on
        minicomputers.  ARJ is written entirely in ANSI C and only uses
        ANSI standard libraries.  All machine dependent functions (file
        date-time modified, file attributes, etc.) are contained in a
        single environment source file using ifdefs to enable one to
        maintain a single version of the source code for multiple different
        machines.  This version has manually optimized CRC and output
        routines.

        The current functionality of ARJ is patterned after that of LHARC
        with additional features derived from those of the competition.

        I have created a new archive format for ARJ to support cross
        platform archives, multiple volume archives, and a new security
        envelope feature.  Trying to maintain compatibility with existing
        formats is difficult and possibly expensive (legally speaking).

        In addition, there are definite plans to port full blown versions
        of ARJ to the AMIGA and ATARI ST platforms.  I expect those
        versions to be available before mid-1991.  There will be a
        simplified version of ARJ in source code to be released for the
        UNIX platform late in 1991.  There are plans for an OS/2 version of
        ARJ, also.

        This may start another compression war, but competition begets new
        and better standards.  Just look at the improvements to PKZIP over
        the past few years.  ARJ is the result of my desire for an archiver
        that would do what I needed.  It is not an attempt to be everything
        to everyone.  But if ARJ is what you need, so much the better.  I
        intend to keep improving ARJ over the long haul even after LHARC
        2.0 is released, because data compression is my hobby.

        Some users, however, believe that miracles will be the result of
        such a war.  I have included a brief synopsis of the state of the
        art of data compression research at the end of this document.  This
        may be enlightening to archiver users.  Archivers have just caught
        up with the state of the art.


     TERMINOLOGY:

        The following terms are used through this manual.

        ARCHIVE - This is a file containing one or more files in a
        compressed or non-compressed state and containing file related
        information such as filename and date-time last modified, etc.

        ARJ FILE - This is an archive created by ARJ.

        COMPRESSION - The process of encoding redundant information into
        data requiring less storage space.

        COMPRESSION PERCENTAGE/RATIO - The percentage compression reported
        by ARJ is a variation of one of the TWO standard methods of
        expressing compression ratio in the technical literature.  ARJ uses
        the compressed size / original size ratio.  The other method is the
        inverse ratio.  When ARJ reports 96% as the compression ratio, that
        means that the compressed file is 96 percent of the original size
        (very little compression).  Other archivers use their own methods.
        LHARC uses the same ratio as ARJ.

        EXTRACTION or UNCOMPRESSION - The processing of recreating the
        exact information that was previously compressed.

        SELF-EXTRACTION MODULE - This is an archive that is an executable
        file that is capable of extracting self-contained files.

        TEXT MODE - In text mode, ARJ inputs the file using the C library
        text mode which translates the carriage return, linefeed control
        characters of MS-DOS to a single linefeed character.  This saves
        space and provides the option for cross platform file extraction.
        On another platform, the host C library would change the single
        linefeed to the host text newline separator sequence. In addition,
        for platforms such as PRIMOS which set bit 8 in ASCII text
        characters, ARJ sets/resets bit 8 according to the platform
        extracted to.

        VOLUMES - These are ARJ archives that are in sequence and have been
        created by a single ARJ command.  Files in the volumes may span
        volumes in a split format.  These volumes are usable archives.


     MAJOR FEATURES OF ARJ:

        BEST compression in terms of size reduction of the currently
        available archivers including PKZIP 1.10, PAK 2.51, and LHARC
        1.13c.  Users have reported that ARJ also compresses slightly
        better than ARC 7.00 BETA.  ARJ is particularly effective with
        database file, text files, and very small files.

        Archive and individual file comments with option of inputting
        comments from a file.

        32 bit CRC file integrity check.

        Test new archive before overwriting the original archive option.

        Multiple volume archives with one ARJ command.  This allows the
        user to backup a full hard disk drive to multiple floppies.
        Recovery of individual files is convenient because each volume is
        an individual archive.  No need to use SLICE with ARJ.

        File re-ordering facility with the option of sorting by file size,
        file extension, CRC value, date-time modified, filename, pathname,
        compression ratio, file attribute and more.

        Multiple string searching within archive files.

        Built-in facility to recover files from broken archives.

        Self-extraction feature that is internal to the ARJ runfile.  The
        SFX module is full-featured with a built-in help screen.

        Internal string data integrity check in ARJ to resist hacking a la
        LHARC to ICE.

        Archive security envelope feature to resist tampering with secured
        archives.  This feature disallows ANY changes to a secured archive.
        Not even comments can be changed.

        Password option to encrypt archived files.

        Text mode data compression option to enable movement of text files
        from one host machine to another.  Text mode also results in
        greater file size reduction on MS-DOS machines.

        File extraction to screen in a paged mode to permit browsing
        through an archive.

        Specification of the files to be added to an archive via one or
        more list files.  In addition, ARJ can generate a list file.

        Specification of files to be excluded from processing by ARJ.

        Sub-directory recursion during compression and extraction.

        ARJ source code compilable on any machine supporting ANSI C.  This
        code has compiled and produced working archivers on at least two
        platforms.  This will allow the porting of ARJ to many other
        platforms.  Source code is not currently available for public
        release.  However, I do intend to release source code for a UNIX
        version of ARJ in 1991.


     RELEASE NOTES:

        This version does NOT include any expiration feature.  ARJ 1.00 is
        fully functional.  No function has been crippled.  I suggest using
        the "-jt" test archive switch to test all archives that you build.

        This version has been tested under DOS 2.11, 3.3, and 4.0.  It has
        NOT been tested under DOS 5.0.

        Here is a suggested command that will test ARJ on all of your files:

        arj a A:\vol c:\*.* -r -jt -y "-vasdel A:\vol.*"


     FUTURE FEATURES:

        Foreign language support.

        Program version of ARJSORT.

        OS/2, AMIGA, ATARI versions.

        If you have useful ideas for ARJ, please let me know.


     GETTING STARTED:

        I assume that you have a copy of the self-extracting ARJ module
        named ARJ100.EXE.  Typing ARJ100 [RETURN] at the DOS command prompt
        will initiate the self-extraction feature.  ARJ100 will by default
        extract its files to the current directory.  When ARJ100 starts,
        you will see several lines of text describing ARJ and then a line
        asking if you wish to continue extraction.  Entering "yes" or "y"
        will continue the extraction.  If there are any duplicate filenames
        in the current directory, the program will prompt you for
        overwriting.  You can say "yes", "no", or "quit".  Only the
        extracted ARJ.EXE file needs to be copied to a directory named in
        your "PATH" command in your autoexec.bat file.  On many PCs, this
        directory may be C:\DOS or C:\BIN.  With MS-DOS 3.0 and above,
        you can use path notation "\BIN\ARJ e archive" to use ARJ.

        You may, of course, prefer to use ARJ 0.15 or 0.20 to extract the
        contents of ARJ100.EXE file manually.

        Example:  ARJ e arj100.exe \temp\

        The AV.EXE file is only a ARJ file lister provided as a skeleton
        program for software developers.  It is not needed for ARJ usage.


     QUICK START TO USING ARJ:

        To create an ARJ archive containing all of the files in the
        current directory:

        ARJ a archive

        To create an ARJ archive containing all files with the ".DOC"
        extension in the current directory:

        ARJ a archive *.DOC

        To create an ARJ archive containing all of the files in the
        named directory and all files in subdirectories of the named
        directory:

        ARJ a archive named_directory\*.* -r

        To extract all of the files in an archive to the current
        directory:

        ARJ e archive

        To extract all of the files in an archive to a named directory:

        ARJ e archive named_directory\

        To extract all files with the ".DOC" extension to the current
        directory:

        ARJ e archive *.DOC

        To extract all of the files in an archive recreating the
        original directory structure:

        ARJ x archive original_directory_name\

        To list all of the files in an archive:

        ARJ l archive


     CONVERTING OTHER ARCHIVE FILES TO ARJ FORMAT

        For those who wish to convert their current archive files to ARJ
        archives, I have found that the freeware 2ALL conversion program
        found in 2ALL_210.ZIP will convert between archives.

        Here is the configuration file 2ALL.CFG that I use for 2ALL.

        ZIP
         pkzip -ex
         pkunzip
        PAK
         pak a
         pak e
        LZH
         lharc a
         lharc e
        ARC
         pkpak -a
         pkunpak -e
        ZOO
         zoo a
         zoo e
        ARJ
         arj a -e -jt
         arj e

        ZZAP is another program that works with ARJ and other archivers.


     HOW TO USE ARJ:

        Where I do not elaborate in this manual, you can assume that ARJ
        usage is similar to that of LHARC.

        If you type ARJ [return] you will see a help screen similar to the
        following:

     ARJ LIMITATIONS:

        ARJ will accept up to:    64 filenames/wildnames on command line
                               16000 filenames resulting from wildnames
                                8000 filenames/wildnames to exclude
                                8000 ARJ filenames resulting from wildnames
                                2048 character comments
                                     (up to 25 lines or 1 file)

        ARJ requires approximately 300,000 bytes plus the memory necessary
        to store all of the pathnames to be archived.

        As far as I know there is no limitation on the number of files that
        can be stored in one archive.  However, each add command can only
        add a maximum of 16000 files at a time depending upon memory
        availability.  I expect that a normal maximum of 5000 to 8000
        filenames can be handled without running out of memory during the
        compress phase.

        If you do not have enough memory, you should use the "-l" switch to
        dump the filenames to a list file.  You can then break the list
        file into smaller files and use multiple ARJ commands to archive
        all of the files.

        Example:

           ARJ a archive \*.* -r -lname.lst

           If the above command fails due to lack of memory, split the
           name.lst file into smaller pieces named name1.lst, name2.lst,
           etc.  Then execute:

           ARJ a archive !name1.lst
           ARJ a archive !name2.lst
           .
           .

        ARJ currently does NOT differentiate between wildnames like "C:*.*"
        and "C:\*.*".  ARJ would expand each of those two wildnames into a
        list that could be up to twice as long as necessary.

        When updating an archive, ARJ creates a temporary file named
        ARJ.$$$ in the current directory or work directory.

        While ARJ is scanning a wildcard filespec, ARJ will change the name
        of the target archive to ARJ.$$$ while the scan is proceeding to
        avoid including the archive itself in an add or move command.
        Also, as a result, you cannot add a file named ARJ.$$$ to an ARJ
        archive.


     DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ARJ AND LHARC:

        The archive formats are NOT compatible.

        The compression and decompression algorithms are NOT compatible.

        ARJ only supports its own archive format.

        ARJ by default stores the full specified pathname of files
        archived minus any drive letter and root symbol.

        The "e" and "x" commands will by default extract all of the files
        in the archive without using date time stamps to select files.  You
        should specify "-u -y" to duplicate LHARC functionality.

        The "f" command in ARJ requires the -r and -p switch to be identical
        to the LHARC f command.

        The ARJ archive suffix is ".ARJ".

        ARJ does NOT sort filenames when archiving.


     IMPORTANT NOTES:

        When using the "-w" working directory switch, ARJ does not check on
        space availability before overwriting the original archive if it
        exists.  Be sure that you have enough disk space for the new
        archive before using the "-w" switch.  If ARJ aborts in this
        situation because of disk space, ARJ will keep the temporary
        archive.

        By default, ARJ does not see hidden or system files when using
        wildnames.  ARJ will process system and hidden when you either
        specify the exact filename or specify the "-a" switch.

        For MS-DOS environments that switch on RAW console mode via
        programs like RAW.COM, ARJ has a new feature which sets ARJ
        to check for RAW mode and switch its STDIN from fgets() to cgets().

        Like LHARC and PKZIP, ARJ requires extra disk space to UPDATE an
        archive file.  ARJ will backup the original archive while it
        creates the new archive, so enough room must be available for both
        archives at the same time.

        Currently, ARJ will not extract to a readonly file.


     ARJ ERROR SITUATIONS:


        ADD:

        If a user specified file is not found during an add, ARJ will
        continue processing, but will keep the archive and terminate with
        an error condition.

        In a disk full condition or any other file i/o error, ARJ will
        promptly terminate with an error condition and delete the temporary
        archive file unless the user has specified the "-jk" switch.


        MOVE:

        ARJ will only delete files that have been successfully added to the
        archive.  If you have specified the "-jt" (test) switch, ARJ will
        abort on any error.  If you specify the "-jk" switch, ARJ will not
        delete the temporary archive upon an abort.


        EXTRACT:

        In a disk full condition or any other file i/o error, ARJ will
        promptly terminate with an error condition and delete the current
        output file.


     ARJ USER ACTION PROMPTS:

        ARJ prompts the user for action at certain times.  There are
        several types of prompts.  One is for yes/no permission, another is
        for a new filename, another is for archive comments, and one other
        is for search strings.  The yes/no prompts will also accept "quit"
        for program termination and "always" to bypass further user
        prompts.

        Since ARJ uses STDIN for user input, be careful about typing ahead
        anticipating prompts.  ARJ may prompt you for an unexpected action
        and use your earlier input.


     ARJ ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE:

        ARJ will first look for an environment variable named ARJ_SW and
        use its value as switch options for ARJ.  If ARJ finds such an
        environment variable, it will display a message to that effect.

        Type SET ARJ_SW = <switches>

        Example:  SET ARJ_SW = -w\temp -k -e

        As in LHARC, command line switches can be selected to override
        ARJ_SW settings.


     ARJ COMMAND LINE SYNTAX:

        ARJ <command> [-<switch>[-|+|<option>]...] <archive_name>[.ARJ]
        [<base_directory_name>\] [<!list_name>|<path_name>|<wild_name>...]

        Currently commands and switches can be entered in upper or lower
        case.  That is subject to change.  For compatibility with future
        versions, you should use lower case commands and switches.

        ARJ now supports the use of either "-" or "/" as the switch option
        character.  The first occurrence of either "-" or "/" that ARJ
        encounters will determine the switch symbol.  You may NOT mix and
        match switch symbols.  This also includes the ARJ_SW environment
        variable.  ARJ_SW is checked first for switches.  Throughout this
        document, the symbol "/" may be substituted for "-" in switch
        usage.

        Examples:  ARJ a A:archive *.* /va /r    is correct
                   ARJ a A:archive *.* /va -r    IS INCORRECT USAGE!

        Switch options SHOULD NOT be combined.  At this time combinations
        such as "-ki" representing "-k" and "-i" will work, but may not in
        the future.

        The switch option "--" tells ARJ that there are no more switch
        options to process in the current command line.  This is useful
        when you need to enter filenames beginning with "-".
        Example:  ARJ a archive -- -testfile

        The standard ARJ file suffix is ".ARJ".  Subsequent multiple volume
        archives end in ".A01", ".A02", etc.

        The ARJ command must be the first non-switch argument after "ARJ".
        The ARJ archive name must be the first filename on the command
        line.  The base directory, if any, must be the second filename
        argument.  The switches and other filenames can be in any order.
        The base directory name must end with "\" (backslash) or ":"
        (colon).

        For commands other than adding files to an archive (a, f, m, u),
        you can specify a wildcard for the archive name such as "*.ARJ".
        Also, if you also specify the "-r" switch,  ARJ will search
        sub-directories for ARJ archives (*.ARJ) also.  Be careful using
        wildcards this way.  The command ARJ d *.ARJ *.* -r will delete
        every file in every archive in and under the current directory.

        Example:  ARJ l * -r  will list all of your *.ARJ files.

        Switches specified on the command line will either toggle or
        override switches specified with the ARJ_SW environment variable.
        Switch usage is identical to that of LHARC.

        "-s+"        turns on switch "s".
        "-s-"        turns off switch "s".
        "-s"         toggles the state of switch "s".
        "-sname"     provides the name argument for switch "-s".
        "--"         skip processing of any more switch options.

        Wild_names follow MS-DOS convention.  "*.*" means all files.
        "*.DOC" means all files with an extension of ".DOC".  "?B*.*"
        means all files with a second character of "B".

        The default for <wild_name> for all commands except for "d" is
        "*.*".

        Filename matching in the archive does not use full pathnames unless
        the "-p" switch is specified.

        You can supply one or more filenames for files containing lists of
        files to be added to an archive.  The filenames must be listed one
        per line with no leading or trailing blanks.  The list filename(s)
        must be prefixed with "!".  Because of the list filename syntax,
        you cannot specify a filename or wildname beginning with "!".

        You can exclude filenames/wildnames from the list of filenames to
        be processed by ARJ.

        Example:  ARJ a software *.* -x*.exe -x*.obj   adds all files
        in the current directory except .EXE and .OBJ files.


     ARJ COMMANDS:

        a: Add files to archive

           This is the basic command to add disk files to an ARJ archive.
           You can specify 0 to 64 filename arguments (one can be a
           destination directory).  The arguments can be wildnames.  If
           you specify the "-r" switch (recurse subdirectories), ARJ
           will add all of the files in all of the subdirectories that
           match the specified wildname.

           Example:  ARJ a -t1 archive subdir\*.*
                     Archive all files in directory "subdir" in text mode.

        c: Comment archive files

           This command allows you to comment the header and individual
           files.  ARJ will prompt you for each comment.  The user will be
           prompted for up to 25 lines for each comment.  A line containing
           only a [return] will terminate the comment.

           The user can elect to input comment data from a file by entering
           the comment filename preceded by an "!" as in "!archive.txt"
           starting in column 1 of the first comment line.  This file is
           read as a text file.  The lines in the text can be up to 2048
           bytes long.  Only the first 2048 bytes of the file will be
           accepted by ARJ.

           To erase a comment from an archive, type [space] [return] on the
           first comment line and [return] on the second comment line.

           To add only the archive comment and not file comments, use the
           following command:

           ARJ c archive ...

           The "..." will not match any filenames.

        d: Delete files from archive

           This commands allows you to delete files from the archive.  When
           wildcard selection is not suitable, you can use the "-q" switch
           which causes ARJ to prompt you for deletion for each file
           selected.

           Example:  ARJ d archive *.c
                     Delete all files in archive ending in ".c".

                     ARJ d archive *.c -q
                     Prompt before deleting files ending in ".c".

        e: Extract files from archive

           This command will extract one or more files from the archive to
           the current directory or base directory if specified.  ARJ will
           prompt the user before overwriting existing files unless the
           user specifies the "-y" switch.  If the user gives a "no"
           answer, ARJ will prompt for a new filename.  If the user enters
           a single [return] instead of a filename, ARJ will skip the
           current file extraction.

           When extracting a file located on multiple volumes, ARJ may
           prompt the user with an "Append? " like prompt.  This will
           usually occur with files split across volumes.

           Example:  ARJ e archive soft\ *.c
                     Extract all files ending in ".c" to subdirectory
                     "soft".

           If you wish to extract only a portion of an archive and that
           portion is a directory containing directories, you should use
           the "-p1" switch.  See the "-p" switch for more information.

        f: Freshen files in archive

           Update matching files in the archive that are OLDER than the
           selected disk files.

           Example:  arj f archive *.c *.h

           NOTE when freshening archives containing files with pathnames,
           you should use the -r and -p switch options for exact directory
           updates; otherwise, ARJ will only look at the files in the
           current directory.

           Example:  arj f -r -p archive

           In the above example, ARJ will freshen the archives according
           to the directory structure from which they were originally
           archived.

        l: List contents of archive

           List contents of archive to standard output.  The display can be
           paused after each screenful with the "-jp" switch.  The files
           are listed in stored order.  There are no sort options
           currently.

           The last field on the display TPMGVX stands for:
               T -> text/binary mode
               P -> path information available in "V" listing
               M -> compression method used
               G -> file has been garbled (encrypted)
               V -> archive has been continued to another volume
               X -> this file is an extended portion of a larger file

           Example:  arj l archive *.c *.h

        m: Move files to archive

           This command is similar to specifying the "a" command with the
           "-d" switch.  The "m" commands adds the selected files to the
           archive.  If the adds are successful, then the added files are
           deleted.  The move command does not ask permission before
           deleting the files.  Use the "-d" switch for that feature.

           Example:  ARJ m archive soft\*.*

        n: reName files in archive

           This command allows you to change the names of the files stored
           in an ARJ archive.  ARJ will prompt for the new name of each
           selected file.  You can skip changing the name of a particular
           file by entering a blank line.

           Example:  ARJ n archive *.c

           In the above example, ARJ prompts for new names for all *.c
           files.

        o: Order files in archive

           This command allows you to re-order the files within the
           archive.  You may specify the order of files on the command line
           or you can use one or more list files.  Any files in the archive
           that are not specified on the command line or in a list file
           will be placed at the end of the archive in the same relative
           order that they were originally.  No wildcard names can be used
           as order specifications.  The filenames in the list file must be
           entered one per line.

           Example:  ARJ o archive file1 file2 file3

           In the above example, the files "file1", "file2", and "file3"
           will be ordered first in the archive.  Any remaining files will
           follow those.

           Example:  ARJ o archive !list

           In the above example, the archive will be ordered according to
           the order of the names in the file "list".

           IMPORTANT:  For the "o"rder command, the list file option has
           one special feature.  If the list file is named ARJSORT.$$$, ARJ
           will expect the file to have been built with the ARJ v -jv1
           command. See the ARJSORT.BAT batch file for an example of this
           special feature.

           To facilitate building list files, the "v" command in ARJ will
           produce special outputs with the "-jv" switch and the "-jv1"
           switch.

           The "-jv" switch will display only the pathnames stored within
           the archive.  No other listing data is displayed.  This output
           can be re-directed to a file for manual sorting into a list
           file.

           The "-jv1" switch will display the standard verbose display with
           a few modifications.  No comment field will be displayed.  The
           pathname is appended to the archive file description data
           instead of being on a separate line.  Displayed just before the
           pathname field are the file extension and filename.  These
           fields are available so that the user can sort the text lines by
           date-time, file extension, CRC value, etc.  Text editors like
           Qedit and SLED allow the user to sort text lines via an embedded
           text field.

        p: Print files to standard output

           Output files to standard output.  This function works such that
           the output file will contain only the file data extracted.  This
           is important for UNIX-like usage.

           Example:  ARJ p archive manual.doc > output.fil

           In the above example, output.fil will be an exact copy of
           manual.doc.  There will be no extraneous header information in
           output.fil.  All extraction phase information is written to the
           STDERR device, which is normally the display screen.

           NOTE:  Because of a problem using fwrite() and STDOUT, errors
           occurring during redirection to serial and printer ports may not
           be detected.  Errors during redirection to disk files will be
           detected.

        r: Remove paths from filenames

           This command causes ARJ to remove the path component from the
           specified filenames stored in the archive.  The default is all
           filenames stored in the archive.  This command is useful if you
           forgot to specify "-e" to exclude paths.

        s: Sample files to screen with pause

           This command is similar to the "p" command except that one
           screenful of data is displayed to the user and a user action is
           then requested.  The action prompt can be suppressed with the
           "-y" switch.

           The "s" command filters the text to output by truncating at 79
           characters per line and displaying '?' for control characters.

        t: Test integrity of archive

           Test the contents of the selected files for the correct CRC
           value.  ARJ uses a 32 bit CRC to validate the contents of the
           files.  The use of 32 bit CRCs is many times better than the
           use of 16 bit CRCs for the detection of errors.

           Use this command to fully test the security envelope on an
           ARJ-SECURED archive.

        u: Update files to archive

           Update older files in the archive and add files that are new to
           the archive.

           Example:  arj u software

        w: Where are text strings in archive

           This command will prompt the user for up to 20 text strings to
           search for within the archive.  The search is done with case
           being significant.  A count of all matches will displayed after
           each individual file is scanned.

           Search strings are limited to 79 characters.

           Matches that span archive volumes will not be detected by
           this string search.

        v: Verbosely list contents of archive

           This command lists the full pathname and comments of the archive
           files as well as the same information as the "l" command.

           Use the "-jp" switch to pause the output after each screen.

           The "-jv" switch will display only the pathnames to the screen.

           The "-jv1" switch will display the archive data in a manner
           suitable for sorting on various fields for use with the "o"
           command.

        x: eXtract files with full pathname

           This command extracts one or more files from the archive to
           their full paths in the current directory or to the base
           directory if specified.  ARJ stores pathnames as if they were
           children of the target directory.  Any drive or root directory
           specifications are stripped before storing unless the "-jf"
           switch was specified.

           Example:  arj x archive *.c

           If you wish to extract only a portion of an archive and that
           portion is a directory containing directories, you should use
           the "-p1" switch.  See the "-p" switch for more information.


     ARJ SWITCH OPTIONS:

        -: (All) skip any more switch options

           The switch option "--" will cause ARJ to stop looking for any
           more switch options on the command line.  This is useful for
           entering filenames beginning with "-".

           Example:  ARJ a archive -- -file

        a: (afu) allow any file Attribute

           By default ARJ will not select system or hidden files via
           wildcarding unless the "-a" option is specified.

        b: (afu) Backup changed files

           The "-b" switch will select only files that have the archive bit
           set.

           If you specify the "-b1" option, files with the archive bit set
           will be selected and the archive bits of all archived files will
           be reset after a successful archive has been built.

           Example:  arj a a:backup1 c:\*.* -b1 -r -va   simulates BACKUP
           command.

           The "-b2" switch does NOT select files.  It causes ARJ to reset
           the archive bits of added files.

           Example:  arj a e:archive c:\*.* -b2 -r    archives all files on
           the C drive and resets all archive bits.

        c: (All) skip time-stamp Check

           Normally with the "u" and "f" commands, ARJ will only update
           files to an archive which are newer.  The "-c" switch will cause
           ARJ to update the archive regardless of the date-time modified
           time stamps.

           When extracting files from an archive with the "-y" and "-f"
           switches set, ARJ would normally skip extracting older files.
           The "-c" switch will force ARJ to extract these older files.

        d: (afu) with Delete (move)

           This switch provides the standard MOVE command.  Successfully
           added files will be deleted.  ARJ will prompt the user before
           deleting the files unless the "-y" switch is specified.  Also,
           you can use the "m" command which does not prompt before
           deleting the files.

           ARJ a archive filename -d -y       is equivalent to

           ARJ m archive filename             and

           ARJ a archive filename
           delete filename

        e: (afu) Exclude paths from filenames

           By default ARJ always stores the pathname of the archived file.
           This switch will cause ARJ to store only the filename component.

           The "-e1" switch option causes ARJ to NOT store the base
           directory name with the filenames in the archive.

           Example:  ARJ a archive C:\SOFTWARE\ARJ\ *.* -r -e1

           In the above example, ARJ will NOT store the C:\SOFTWARE\ARJ\ as
           part of the filenames.

        f: (All) Freshen existing files

           This switch causes ARJ to only extract newer files from the
           archive.

        g: (All) Garble with password

           This switch followed by a password "-gpassword" will encrypt or
           decrypt an archived file.  During a "l" or "v" command, a
           garbled file will display an "G" after the method number.

           Example:  ARJ e archive -gpassword

           IMPORTANT INFORMATION:  Due to a bug in test versions of
           ARJ, certain files that are stored with method 0 with a password
           will not be extractable.  You will see CRC errors reported.
           This version of ARJ has a temporary option "-jg" that will
           extract those garbled files.

           Example:  ARJ e archive -gpassword -jg

        i: (All) with no progress Indicator

           Do not display the percentage progress indicator.  The progress
           indicator appears during the add, extract, search, and test
           operations.

        j: (All) selects alternate set of switch characters.

           This switch toggles the set of switch characters.  For example,
           "-ja" is not the same function as "-a".

        k: (Upd) Keep archive file backup

           Backup the original archive file during an update.  The old
           archive will be suffixed with ".BAK".  Any existing ".BAK" file
           will be overwritten.

        l: (All) create List_name file

           This switch will cause ARJ to dump to the filename after the
           "-l" switch all of the filenames to be processed by this ARJ
           command.  This list contains all files that matched the file
           wildnames given on the command line.

           This list file can be used as a listfile on the command line.

           Example:  ARJ a -lname.lst archive *.exe

           This example will create a file named "name.lst" with all *.exe
           files.

        m: (afu) with Method 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

           Method 0 = storing   (no compression)
           Method 1 = maximum compression
                                (requires 334,000 plus bytes memory)
           Method 2 = slightly less compression
                                (requires 256,000 plus bytes memory)
           Method 3 = less compression
                                (requires 272,000 plus bytes memory)
           Method 4 = fastest compression
                                (requires 256,000 plus bytes memory)

           Example:  ARJ a archive *.exe -m2

           Method 1 and 2 are similar.  Method 2 uses less memory and
           produces slightly less compression.

           Method 3 is very fast and gives compression slightly less than
           PKZIP, PAK, and LHARC.

           Method 4 uses a different decoder than 1 to 3.  Method 4 is
           provided as a fast compression format.  It is comparable in
           speed to PKZIP but provides slightly less compression.

           IMPORTANT INFORMATION:  ARJ 1.00 method 4 has been improved in
           size compression but is NOT compatible with versions earlier
           than 0.15.  However, ARJ 1.00 will still extract and test
           method 4 files correctly, but future versions of ARJ may not
           have that capability.  The new method 4 is more effective with
           files over 8000 bytes in size.  NOTE that the use of method 4 is
           purely user specified.  ARJ will never by default use method 4.
           Methods 1, 2, and 3 are slightly different from earlier
           versions, but are STILL compatible with earlier versions.  The
           method 1 in ARJ 0.15 no longer exists because of the time
           penalty.  Archives created by 0.15 are still compatible with
           all versions of ARJ (0.13 to 1.00).

        n: (All) only New files (not exist)

           Only archive or extract files that do not exist in the target
           archive or directory.

        o: (All) On or after date YYMMDDHHMMSS

           The switch "-o" by itself means select files modified today.  If
           "-o" is followed by a date and optionally a time, ARJ will only
           select files modified on or after that date-time.

           Example:  ARJ a test -o9001021700    means select files modified
           on or after Jan 2, 1990, 5:00 PM.

           Years less than "80" will be considered as 21st century years.

           There is no option for using other date-time formats.

           The switch "-ob" selects files modified before today.  If "-ob"
           is followed by a date and optionally a time, ARJ will only
           select files modified before that date-time.

        p: (All) match using full Pathnames

           By default ARJ normally uses just the filename component to
           match files within the archive.  When "-p" is specified, ARJ
           looks for an exact path match, and then, looks for a filename
           component match.

           You should use the "-p" switch when updating an archive built
           with the "-r" switch.

           To match directory paths that contain subdirectories, you should
           use the "-p1" switch.  This switch sets ARJ to match only the
           initial portion of the pathnames against the wildnames
           specified.  For example, if your archive contains the TURBOC++
           directory named TC and you wish to extract the INCLUDE
           subdirectory along with the subdirectory INCLUDE\SYS, you can
           use the following command:

           ARJ e archive TC\INCLUDE -p1

           If you wanted to extract all of the INCLUDE\S*.* files including
           the contents of the SYS subdirectory, you can use the following
           command:

           ARJ e archive TC\INCLUDE\S*.* -p1

        q: (All) Query on each file

           This switch causes ARJ to prompt the user prior to acting upon
           each archived file for all but the "l", "t", "v", and "w"
           commands.  This allows you to selectively delete, add, etc.

        r: (All) Recurse subdirectories

           This switch will cause ARJ to recurse any wildcards specified on
           the command line including ARJ archive filenames by traversing
           all subdirectories scanning for matches.

           ARJ will also recurse non-wildcard filenames as in:
           ARJ a archive FILE.BBS -r

           You should use the "-p" switch when updating an archive built
           with the "-r" switch.

        s: (Upd) set archive time-Stamp

           This switch causes ARJ to set the date-time stamp of the archive
           to that of the newest file in the archive.

           This option will also work with non-update commands as in:
           ARJ l archive -s ...

        t: (afu) set file Type

           This switch causes ARJ to open and read the file to be archived
           in binary or text mode.  The default is binary mode (-t0).  To
           archive in text mode, use the -t1 switch.  The "-t" switch is
           equivalent to "-t0".

           If you specify the switch "-t0", ARJ will always use the binary
           mode even for freshening text mode files already in the archive.

           The file type "text" is only needed for future cross platform
           transfers of ARJ archives.  It enables ARJ to extract text files
           to the host file system with the text newline sequence that is
           correct for that operating system.

           However, this mode may produce slightly better size reduction.
           The "-t1" option combined with "-jh65000" can produce some of
           the best size reduction numbers.

           DO NOT use the text mode on non-text files!!!  On non-text files
           ARJ will prematurely stop input if it finds an embedded EOF
           character (CTL Z). This will produce a LOSS of data on binary
           files.

        u: (All) Update files (new and newer)

           This switch causes ARJ to archive or extract newer and
           non-existing files.

        v: (All) enable multiple Volumes

           This switch allows the creation of multiple volumes in the ADD
           mode.  The command "arj a a:arjvol \*.* -b -r -v360000" allows a
           user to backup up all files changed since the last backup to
           multiple floppy disks.  ARJ will pause between volumes to allow
           changing disks.  Subsequent volumes will be suffixed .A01, .A02,
           .A03, ... , .A99, .A00, .A01, etc.

           Archived files can be split across volumes.  ARJ will try to
           fill each volume to within 200 to 3000 bytes of specified
           maximum size.

           The command "arj x a:arjvol -v" would restore files starting
           from arjvol.arj.  You must specify the entire ARJ volume name
           including the .Ann suffix when starting from the middle of a
           series of volumes.

           The pauses between volumes can be suppressed with the "-y"
           switch.  You should not suppress the pauses when archiving to
           diskettes.

           Because of the splitting process, archived split files with a
           size of zero bytes are possible.  This is not an error.

           If you comment your archives with long comments, you should take
           that into account when specifying volume size.  You should
           specify a smaller volume size during the "a" command before
           adding the comments.

           The "-v" switch will accept the abbreviations 360, 720, 1200,
           and 1440.  These will be translated to 362,000, 730,000,
           1,213,000, and 1,457,000 bytes, respectively.

           You can use the "K" modifier as a shortcut for "000".  For
           example, 100K means 100000.

           The "-vv" switch turns on the next volume beep option.  When you
           select this option, ARJ will sound a beep prior to the next
           volume.  The "v" modifier must come before any other modifier.

           The "-va" switch sets the disk space auto-detect option.  ARJ
           will check for the disk space available on the target directory
           and try to use all or most of it.  This option is aimed at
           diskette usage.  Please note that this switch option detects
           free disk space.  It does not detect formatted disk space.

           Examples:  ARJ a A:backup -b -va
                      ARJ a backup -v360

           The switch modifier "s" can be used to make ARJ execute one
           specified system command prior to each volume or make ARJ pause
           for manual execution of system commands.  This is useful for
           purging target diskettes before ARJ writes to them.  The "s"
           modifier must follow the "a" modifier or the volume size.
           Optionally, after the "s" modifier, you can specify a system
           command or batch file name.  ARJ will automatically execute the
           command or batch file before each volume.  If the command has
           embedded blanks, then the entire switch option must be
           surrounded by double quotes.  The system command is executed
           before ARJ executes the auto-detect space option.

           Examples:  ARJ a A:backup -vas
                      ARJ a A:backup -vvas
                      ARJ a A:backup -v360s
                      ARJ a A:backup -vv360s
                      ARJ a A:backup -vaspurge.bat
                      ARJ a A:backup -v360sdelete.bat
                      ARJ a A:backup "-vasFORMAT A:"
                      ARJ a A:backup "-vasDIR C:\ "

           Note that the last example has a space before the last double
           quote mark.  If the last space is missing, the internal command
           line parser will make the double quote mark part of the DIR
           command.

           Volume archives can be used as stand-alone archives save for the
           files that are split across volumes.

           It is recommended that the "-jt" (test archive) option be used
           with the "-v" switch to ensure perfectly built volumes as it is
           tedious to retest volumes after they are built.

           WARNING:  Updating multiple volume archives with the "-v" switch
           set is NOT recommended, especially if the new file sizes are not
           identical.

        w: (Upd) assign Work directory

           By default, ARJ builds a new ARJ archive file in the same
           directory as the old archive file.  By specifying the "-w"
           switch, you can specify the working directory where the
           temporary archive file will be built.  After the temporary
           archive file is built, it is copied over the original one and
           deleted.

           Normally ARJ requires enough disk space for the original archive
           and the new temporary archive.  Specifying the "-w" switch
           allows you to move some of that disk space requirement to
           another directory.

           If the copy of the temporary archive on top of the original
           archive fails, you will have to manually do the copy.  ARJ will
           not delete the temporary archive in this error situation.

           Example:  ARJ a -we:\temp\ archive *.c

        x: (afu) Exclude filenames

           This switch is used to exclude filenames or wildnames from the
           list of filenames to be processed.  Currently, this only works
           with the "a", "f", "m", and "u" commands.

           Example:  ARJ a archive soft\*.* -r -x*.exe -x*.obj -xtest

           This example will archive all files in the soft directory and
           sub-directories with the exception of any files named "test"
           or ending in ".exe" and ".obj".

           You can also specify an exclude file list by preceding the
           filename with the "!" character.  The exclude file list must
           contain a list of filenames/wildnames one per line with no
           leading or trailing blanks.

           Example:  ARJ a archive soft\*.* -r -x!exclude.lst

           A maximum of 8000 filenames or wildnames can be excluded.

        y: (All) assume Yes on all queries

           Use this switch for batch type uses of ARJ.  This switch
           disables most of the normal user queries during ARJ execution.
           Use this switch to suppress overwrite queries in the "e" and "x"
           commands, to suppress the make new directory query in the "e"
           and "x" commands, to suppress the pause during the "s" command
           and to suppress the next volume pause using the "-v" option.
           Use this option with due caution, especially during extraction
           as this sets ARJ to overwrite files.

       ja: (All) show ANSI comments

           Display any ANSI escape sequences unaltered.  By default, escape
           characters in comments are not displayed.  In ARJ 1.00, IBM
           graphics characters will always be displayed.

       jc: (All) test for Console RAW mode    [OBSOLETE switch]

           This is the default mode for ARJ in 1.00.  ARJ tests the console
           device for RAW mode.  If the console is in RAW mode, ARJ will
           use cgets() instead of fgets() for input.  This prevents ARJ
           from hanging the system.

           If this feature causes a problem with your system, you can
           disable this test feature with the "-jc1" switch.

       jd: (exlv) ensure free Disk space

           In extraction mode, this option causes ARJ to always ensure that
           it will leave the user specified amount of disk space available.
           ARJ will skip files that would exceed the disk space available
           limit. Files that are skipped will each count as an error.  The
           default free space is zero bytes.

           Example:  ARJ e archive basedir\ *.doc -jd100K

           In the above example, ARJ will not extract any files that will
           cause the disk free space to be less than 100,000 bytes.  The
           "K" is a synonym for "000".  For example, 100K means 100000.

           In "l"ist or "v"erbose list mode, this option sets an error
           check at the end of the listing screen based upon the total of
           the original sizes of the files selected.  If the total size
           would exceed the user specified free space limit, ARJ will
           report an error at the end of the listing screen.

           Example:  ARJ l archive *.doc -jd10000

           In this example, ARJ will report an error if the current
           available disk space minus the total of the *.doc files is less
           than the specified minimum of 10,000 bytes.

       je: (Upd) create self-Extracting archive

           This option causes ARJ to create a self-extracting .EXE file
           instead of an .ARJ file.  This self-extractor is about 14000
           bytes in size and supports full pathname extraction.  The "-je1"
           switch creates a smaller self-extracting .EXE file.  The
           ARJSFXJR module is less than 6000 bytes in size.

           The current commands ARJSFX supports are:

           Usage: ARJSFX [-command] [-switch(s)] [directory\] [file(s)]

           Commands:
           e: Extract files (default)
           l: List contents            v: Verbosely list contents
           t: Test contents            x: eXtract files with pathname

           Switches:
           a: show ANSI comments       n: only New files (not exist)
           c: skip time stamp Check    p: match with Pathname
           f: Freshen existing files   u: Update files (new + newer)
           g: unGarble with password   y: assume Yes on queries

           NOTE!!!  ARJSFX uses the "-" character before all commands and
           switches.  This is to allow extraction of files named e, l, etc.

           ARJSFX does not support compression method 4.

           The ARJSFX module supports the ARJ-SECURITY envelope feature by
           itself.  The ARJ-SECURITY feature is only available as a
           licensed option.  It is intended as a feature for software
           developers.

           ARJ will create a self-extracting module without an intermediate
           archive file.

           Example:  ARJ a software *.* -je

           If you want to make a self-extracting module from an ARJ
           archive, use the freshen command with a non-existent filename
           argument such as "...".  In this case, ARJ will report the
           self-extractor created with 0 file(s).  The 0 file(s) indicate
           that no files were modified during the self-extractor creation.

           Example:  ARJ f software ... -je

           IMPORTANT:  When executing an ARJSFX module on a system with the
           CONSOLE device set to RAW mode, the ARJSFX module will abort on
           user input to avoid hanging the system.  Using the "-y" switch
           on the command line will avoid the problem.

           Example:  ARJ100 -y

           The ARJSFXJR module created with the "-je1" switch is a stripped
           down version of ARJSFX.  ARJSFXJR does not accept any command
           line options.  It does not support method 4 or text mode "-t1"
           or garbled "-g" archives.  An ARJSFXJR module containing files
           with pathnames will extract to the paths only if the directories
           involved already exist.

           Example:  ARJ f software ... -je1

       jf: (afu) store Full specified path

           Normally, ARJ will strip all pathnames of drive letter and root
           symbol.  This switch disables this action.  When extracting with
           the "x" command from an archive that was built with this switch,
           you should NOT use the base directory option on the command
           line.

       jh: (afu) set Huffman buffer size

           ARJ has a default static Huffman buffer size of 16384 bytes.
           This buffer size is better for compressing executable files.
           The buffer size in ARJ 0.15 and earlier was set to 65500 bytes.
           That size is better for large text files.  You may specify a
           buffer size from 2048 to 65535 bytes.

           Example:  ARJ a archive *.txt -jh65500

       jk: (Upd) Keep temp archive on error

           When the "-jk" switch has been specified, ARJ will keep the
           temporary archive during an aborted archive build/update. During
           a failed build, ARJ will modify the temporary archive to make it
           useable by removing the broken portion.

       jp: (lv)  Pause after each screenful

           This switch will cause ARJ to pause after listing each screenful
           of data for the "l" and "v" commands.  Press the ENTER key to
           continue the listing.  You can also enter "quit" to exit ARJ.

           In one special case, "ARJ -? -jp", the use of the -jp switch
           toggles page pauses off, because by default in help mode,
           pausing is on.

       jr: (All) Recover broken archive files

           This switch is used to access headers and files in an archive
           that has been corrupted either with bad data or missing data.
           This switch lets ARJ find the next valid header for listing,
           extraction or testing.  ARJ will continue to look for headers
           until it finds the end of file.  At that point ARJ will print an
           error message stating that it encountered the end of file
           unexpectedly.  This is to be expected.

           If file header data has been corrupted, ARJ will be unable to
           recover any file data associated with that header.  If file data
           has been corrupted, ARJ will abort but not delete any extracted
           file data.  To continue recovering from such a corrupted
           archive, simple specify one filename to extract at a time or use
           the "-q" query switch to prompt for individual files.

           Example:  ARJ e archive -jr -q

       js: (afu) Store archives by suffix

           This switch is used to force ARJ to store and not compress files
           with the following extensions: .ARJ, .ZIP, .LZH, .PAK, .ARC.

           The file extensions can be specified as follows:

           ARJ a archive -js.zoo.ice.gif

           The above command will store files with extensions ending in
           .ZOO, .ICE, and .GIF.  This overrides the defaults.

           You can use the environment variable ARJ_SW to set up your own
           defaults as follows:

           set arj_sw = -js.arj.zip.lzh -js-

           The "-js-" turns off the option by default so that when you
           specify the "-js" switch on the command line, ARJ will already
           know what extensions that you want to store.

       jt: (Upd) Test temporary archive

           This switch causes ARJ to execute an archive integrity check on
           the intermediate temporary archive before overwriting any
           pre-existing original archive.  If any error occurs, ARJ will
           not overwrite the original archive.  When using the "-w" switch,
           ARJ will test the final archive file before deleting any files.

           Example:  ARJ m archive *.c -jt

       ju: (All) translate UNIX style paths

           This switch causes ARJ to translate any subsequently encountered
           pathnames to MS-DOS style from UNIX style.  This switch also
           causes translation of filenames entered as a result of ARJ
           prompts such as in comment filenames.

           Example:  ARJ a archive -ju /soft/*.c

       jv: (All) set Verbose display

           This switch sets ARJ to display more information during the
           "t"est, "l"ist, "v"erbose list, and "ex"tract commands.

           Example:  ARJ t archive -jv

           The "-jv" switch causes the "v" command to display only the
           pathnames to the screen.

           The "-jv1" switch causes the "v" command to display the archive
           data in manner suitable for sorting on various fields.

       jx: (afu) start at eXtended position

           This switch is used to continue a file on another archive
           manually.  This switch is normally for use when a multiple
           volume "a" command has aborted.

           Example:  ARJ a arjvol.a01 manual.doc -jx100000

           This example archives manual.doc starting from file byte
           position 100000 and on.


     ARJ_SECURITY ENVELOPE:

        The ARJ-SECURITY ENVELOPE feature provides a facility similar to
        other archivers.  This feature disallows any type of modification,
        even commenting, to an ARJ-SECURED archive by ARJ.  Moreover, there
        are additional internal checks to determine if the ARJ-SECURED
        archive has been modified in any way.  This feature is intended for
        use by software developers who distribute their software in
        archived format.  However, there can be no guarantee that computer
        pirates will not defeat this mechanism.

        In normal use, ARJ will display one of two messages when processing
        an archive with a valid ARJ-SECURITY envelope.  ARJ will either
        state that the archive MAY have a valid ARJ-SECURITY envelope or
        that the archive HAS a valid ARJ-SECURITY envelope.  ARJ can only
        be sure that the envelope is valid when the "t", "e", or "x"
        command is executed on ALL of the archived files.  In order to
        fully test the security envelope of an archive, use the "t" command
        as in "ARJ t archive".

        If the security envelope has been tampered with or the archive has
        suffered data corruption, ARJ will display a message stating that
        the security envelope has been violated.


     KNOWN ARJ ISSUES/PROBLEMS:

        When using a working directory, ARJ does not check for disk space
        before overwriting the original archive.  Be sure you have enough
        space before updating an archive using the "-w" switch.

        DO NOT continue to use older versions of ARJ earlier than 0.15a.
        ARJ archives that have been created with 2048 byte sized comments
        will produce unpredictable results when processed by older versions
        of ARJ.

        I am currently trying to determine how the "-p" switch and pathname
        matching should really work.  It seems to me that on a non-updating
        command, that a pathname specification should be matched on its
        entirety even without a "-p" being specified.  However, the current
        ARJ usage requires "-p" to be specified for full pathname matching.

        There is also an issue with the "f" command and archives containing
        files with pathnames.  The LHARC f archive is done with ARJ via
        ARJ f -r -p archive.

        I would appreciate any comments.


     ARJ TECHNICAL SUPPORT:

        I have received many useful suggestions from users all over the
        world.  Many of those suggestions are in this version or will be
        incorporated in later versions of ARJ.

        I will try to resolve software problems with ARJ as they are made
        known to me.  Please notify me of any ARJ problems by mail, email
        or via the ARJ support BBSes mentioned below.  Despite the fact
        that ARJ is free for many users, I will strive to make ARJ a
        robust, stable and useful product for all users.  To facilitate a
        prompt reply when using the postal system, please enclose a stamped
        self-addressed envelope with your correspondence.  Keeping up with
        the ARJ mail has become somewhat expensive.  Some extra postage
        stamps tossed into the envelope would be greatly appreciated.

        ARJ is available from a number of other BBS's, but I can only vouch
        for the integrity of the archive if the ARJ100.EXE verifies its
        ARJ-SECURITY envelope as valid.  If no security envelope exists,
        then the data has been re-archived and there is no assurance of
        data integrity.

     FINAL COMMENTS:

        I do hope that you find this program as useful as I have.  I would
        appreciate any suggestions to improve this archiver.  I do have
        another archiver called ARJX which is completely compatible with
        ARJ and provides tighter compression at two to three times the
        speed using a proprietary compression algorithm.  For many files,
        ARJX has demonstrated higher compression speed than PKZIP 1.10.
        ARJX will not be released until early 1991 at the earliest for
        legal reasons.  ARJX is NOT VAPORWARE.  It is as finished a product
        as ARJ.  I use ARJX daily.  The file RESULTS.DOC shows the ARJX
        performance.  A license policy for ARJX has not been determined at
        this time.

     RECENT DATA COMPRESSION RESEARCH:

        The following information is explained in more detail in the book,
        TEXT COMPRESSION by Timothy Bell, John Cleary and Ian Witten
        published by Prentice Hall, 1990.  ISBN 0-13-911991-4.

        Three of the most useful types of data compression involve context
        modeling, Lempel-Ziv 1977, and Lempel-Ziv 1978.

        Context models use the preceding few characters to PREDICT
        (estimate the probability of) the next character.  For example,
        what is the next character after "tabl"?  There is a high
        probability that the character is "e".  Much of today's research is
        focused on these types of data compressors because they provide the
        best "TEXT" compression results.  The disadvantage of this family
        of compressors is the amount of memory required.  Three practical
        models require from 500,000 to 5,000,000 bytes of memory.

        More familiar is the Lempel-Ziv 1978 (LZ78) family of data
        compressors.  This family as well as Lempel-Ziv 1977 are classified
        as adaptive dictionary encoders.  In these methods, text strings
        are replaced by pointers to previous occurrences of duplicate
        strings.  For example, the words in this document could be
        represented by dictionary page and line numbers.  The significant
        characteristic of LZ78 algorithms is the parsing of previous text
        data into PHRASES that are stored in a dictionary.  Pointers are
        allowed to reference such phrases; however, pointers are not
        allowed to reference substrings of such phrases.

        Lempel-Ziv-Welch, 1984, (ARC shrinking, crushing, UNIX COMPRESS) is
        the most familiar of this family.  Numerous articles have been
        published concerning this method.  Unknown to many is the fact that
        this algorithm has a US patent number owned by UNISYS.  These
        algorithms are FAST.  Their disadvantages include the problem of
        handling a FULL dictionary when the input text data no longer
        matches the contents of the dictionary and the poor compression of
        non-text data.

        Lempel-Ziv 1977 (LZ77) algorithms have recently come into popular
        practical use (LHARC, PKZIP 1.10, ARJ, PAK).  In the original LZ77
        scheme, pointers are allowed to reference any phrase in a
        fixed-size window that precedes the current phrase.  A matched
        current phrase is replaced by the pointer to the previously
        occurring duplicate phrase.  This pointer in LZ77 consists of an
        offset into the window and the length of the phrase.  The original
        implementation was considered impractical as it used a brute force
        string searching method to find duplicates.  It was quite slow
        requiring up to N character comparisons in an N sized window for
        each phrase looked for.

        However, in 1987, Timothy Bell proposed using a binary tree to
        index into the window to speed the lookup of phrases.  This
        provided an order of magnitude speed increase.  In the same year,
        Brent published an algorithm that used a secondary compression
        method (Huffman encoding, 1952) to further encode the output of a
        LZ77 encoder.  Huffman encoding is the subsitution of variable
        bit-length codes for standard codes (8-bit ASCII) based upon
        frequency of occurrence.  The most frequent codes have the shortest
        bit-lengths.

        LHARC is a combination of these two ideas.  It uses a binary tree
        LZ77 encoder with dynamic Huffman encoding (1978) of the output.
        The advantage of using dynamic Huffman encoding is adaptivity to
        rapidly changing data.  The disadvantage is slow decoding.

        PKZIP 1.0, I believe, uses a combination of binary tree encoding
        with SHANNON-FANO (1949) static encoding.  Static SHANNON-FANO
        encoding has the advantage of fast decoding and the disadvantage of
        less optimal compression especially on rapidly changing data.

        PKZIP will perform better in compression than LHARC on many large
        files because PKZIP uses a larger window (8K) than LHARC (4K).
        LHARC will perform best on binary data with rapidly changing
        characteristics like executables that include a lot of text data.

        LH (LHarc 2.0), I believe, uses a digital TRIE LZ77 encoder with a
        static Huffman encoder.  It uses an 8K window.  LH uses a
        particularly efficient Huffman encoder which works on small data
        sets.  Many static encoders suffer from the cost of including the
        table of codes with the encoded data.  The digital TRIE has the
        advantage of always producing the most recent match unlike binary
        trees.  This recency of match is significant when secondary
        compression is used. Much of this work has been derived and
        improved upon from literature published in the last two years.

        ARJX improves upon LH by using a proprietary LZ77 encoder (1990)
        that is one of the fastest available for limited memory use.  This
        encoder is not derived from any published literature.

        It will be interesting to see if developers can significantly
        improve upon LH since it is based upon the most recent published
        research in data compression.

        One of the most significant new encoders published is that of Fiala
        and Greene, 1989.  This method uses pointers that point to nodes in
        the TRIE data structure as opposed to the phrases in the window.
        This bypasses the problem of redundancy of phrases in any given
        window.  Since each node is unique, fewer pointers are needed and
        thus are more easily compressed by a secondary compressor.  This
        technique is currently patent pending.

        I hope that this synopsis of compression research has been
        enlightening.
