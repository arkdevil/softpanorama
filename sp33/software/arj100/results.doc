
    COMPRESSION COMPARISON TEST RESULTS - January 14, 1991


    1.00 RESULTS SUMMARY:
    ---------------------


    To facilitate repeatable test results I have used the contents of the
    original PKZIP 1.10 distribution archive, PKZ110.EXE, as the base data
    to compress.  This should allow anyone to verify these results except
    for the ARJX numbers.


    The PKZIP 1.10 distribution archive totals 302196 bytes.

    NOTES:

    PAK, LHARC, and PKZIP compression size results are very similar. The
    ARJ/ARJX versions performed significantly better at size reduction.

    PKZIP is no longer the fastest.  Of course, some of the fast ARJ
    results provide less compression than PKZIP.  But some of the ARJX
    results are both faster and more compressive than PKZIP.  Both ARJ 0.20
    and ARJX 0.20 are faster than previous versions because of some manual
    assembler optimizations.  This, of course, is not a definitive test
    because it only involves one set of data files.

    In this test the default mode of ARJ compresses about FIVE percent
    better than PKZIP.

    The slightly improved ARJ/X 0.20 compressions are due to using the -e
    switch to exclude paths from the archives and also due to an
    improvement in the Huffman encoder.

    ARJX is a compatible version of ARJ using a proprietary algorithm and
    will not be released until early 1991 to mid 1991.

    Testing was done on an TOSHIBA 1200XE (286) at 12 MHz with a 1.8
    megabyte RAMDISK in expanded memory using an EMS simulator.  Norton SI
    reports a CI of 11.7 and a DI 9.6 on the RAMDISK.  Test output was
    redirected from STDOUT to a RAMDISK file.
