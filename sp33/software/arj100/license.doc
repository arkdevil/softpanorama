
     ARJ LICENSE POLICY                               February 1991
     ------------------


     The ARJ archiver, the ARJSFX module, the ARJSFXJR module, and its
     documentation are copyright (c) 1990,91 Robert K Jung, all rights
     reserved.  They may not be circulated in any incomplete or modified
     form, nor sold for profit, without written permission of the author.
     If you distribute this software to others, you are required to
     distribute the ENTIRE package consisting of the following files:

     ARJ100.EXE  (in an ARJ-SECURITY envelope as created by the author)


     The use and/or sale of ARJ, ARJSFX, and ARJSFXJR is subject to the
     following terms:


     INDIVIDUAL USE:

     ARJ, ARJSFX, and ARJSFXJR may be freely used and shared with others.
     There is no required registration fee for non-commercial personal use.
     However, if you find ARJ of value, a gift of ten dollars or any amount
     would be greatly appreciated.


     BULLETIN BOARD SYSTEM (BBS) USE:

     ARJ may be freely used on non-commercial computer bulletin board
     systems where ARJ is a primary archive format.


     INSTITUTIONAL/COMMERCIAL SITE LICENSE:

     Any corporation, institution, government agency or business wishing to
     use ARJ/ARJSFX/ARJSFXJR in the course of its business must purchase a
     SITE LICENSE.  A sample SITE LICENSE for the internal use of
     ARJ/ARJSFX/ARJSFXJR is included at the end of this document.  Please
     see the ORDER.FRM or write for terms.


     DISTRIBUTION LICENSE:

     Any corporation, institution, government agency or business wishing
     to include ARJ, ARJSFX, or ARJSFXJR as an integral part of a software
     and/or hardware distribution must purchase a DISTRIBUTION LICENSE.
     Please write for terms providing details of expected distribution
     numbers, required diskettes before and after compression, a
     description of the software/hardware and the specific ARJ software to
     be used in the distribution.


     RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONAL USE:

     To obtain the donation of a SITE LICENSE, please write providing
     details of your organization's religious and charitable activities.
     A free SITE LICENSE will be provided to qualifying organizations.
     Qualifications will be determined on a purely subjective basis.
     Non-qualifying organizations can always obtain a SITE LICENSE by
     purchase.


     COMMERCIAL SALE:

     Any software dealer or library may distribute ARJ in an unmodified
     form for a fee as long as the price charged for the disk containing
     ARJ does not exceed US $10.00.  With this single exception, the sale
     of ARJ for profit, either alone or together with other software or
     hardware, requires a licensing agreement providing for royalty
     payments.  Please write for terms.


     ARJ SOURCE CODE:

     The ANSI C source code for ARJ may be obtained under a license
     arrangement with a non-disclosure policy.

     The portability of the source code has been demonstrated by ports to
     two disparate operating systems.  The same code worked flawlessly on
     both machines.  One is a Big-endian and the other is a Little-endian.
     One uses 16 bit INTs and the other uses 32 bit INTs.  The vanilla
     version should compile and run under most ANSI C compilers with little
     or no modification.  I will be making a K & R version soon.

     Please write for terms.


     ARJ-SECURITY ENVELOPE USE:

     This feature is intended for software developers who wish to
     distribute archived software with some assurance that the archived
     software in a validated ARJ-SECURED archive will be secure.
     Therefore, I reserve the right to limit the distribution of serial
     numbers.  Please see the ORDER.FRM or write for terms.
