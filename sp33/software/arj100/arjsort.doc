    ARJSORT.BAT is a batch file provided to give the user the facility to
    sort the files in an ARJ archive.  ARJSORT allows sorting by file
    attribute, CRC value, date-time modified, file extension, filename,
    pathname, and compression ratio.  The sort order can be set for
    ascending or descending order.

    Usage:  ARJSORT archive [/a | /c | /d | /e | /f | /o | /p | /s | /t] [/r]
            /a=attribute, /c=crc, /d=date-time, /e=extension, /f=filename
            /o=ratio, /p=pathname, /s=size
            /r=reverse order, must be the last argument on the command line

    ARJSORT uses the special ARJSORT.$$$ feature of the order command.  A
    list file named ARJSORT.$$$ is expected to be in a special format by
    the order command.  That format is produced by the ARJ v -jv1 command.
    ARJSORT requires the MS-DOS EDLIN and SORT programs to be available for
    ARJSORT to work.  ARJSORT creates several temporary files named
    ARJSORT.$$?.  These temporary files will be deleted at the end of the
    program.


    ARJSORT Examples:

    ARJSORT archive       - Sort files in ascending alphabetical pathname
                            order.

    ARJSORT archive /r    - Sort files in descending pathname order.

    ARJSORT archive /d    - Sort files in chronological date-time modified
                            order.

    ARJSORT archive /d /r - Sort files in descending chronological
                            date-time modified order.

    ARJSORT archive /s    - Sort files in ascending file size order.
