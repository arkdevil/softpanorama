   This archive contains a new file archiver called ARJ.  This is release
   1.00.  This is a standard production release.  This is a full featured
   UNCRIPPLED public release.  ARJ is free for non-commercial personal use.
   Commercial or governmental use requires a site license.

   Major features of ARJ include:

      Production of consistently smaller archive files than produced by
      PKZIP 1.10, PAK 2.51, and LHARC 1.13c.  This has been verified by
      many ARJ users from Brazil to Canada and across the Atlantic in
      England.  ARJ is particularly effective on text files and database
      files.

      Option to create multiple volume archives with one command making ARJ
      useful for making backups to multiple floppies or archiving a very
      large file to several floppies without "SLICE"ing.

      Option to test newly created archive before overwriting original
      archive or deleting input files for a move command.

      Selectable compression options including FAST!!! compression modes.

      Command to change the filenames of files stored in archives.

      Command to re-order the files within the archive in any user
      specified order.

      Multiple string searching within archives.

      32 bit CRCs for file integrity.

      Text mode compression to enable cross-platform extraction of files.

      Filename specification via list files option.

      Filename/wildname exclusion option.

      Built-in facility to recover files from broken archives.

      Setting of comments for archive and files with a file input option.

      ARJ internal CRC checks to resist hacking a la "ICE".

      Archive security envelope to resist tampering.  ARJ-SECURITY
      disallows archive update of any kind including commenting.

      Self-extraction option built into ARJ.EXE.  Self-extractor has
      security envelope checking feature.

      ARJ100 -l

   To verify the ARJ-SECURITY envelope and contents of ARJ100.EXE, type:

      ARJ100 -t

   To extract the files in ARJ100.EXE, type:

      ARJ100

   This will extract the files in ARJ100.EXE to the current directory.

   You can also use ARJ 0.15 or later to extract the contents of the
   ARJ100.EXE archive.  If you have a ARJ100.ZIP archive, you can skip
   the PKUNZIP function and type the following:

      ARJ e ARJ100.ZIP

   This will extract only the embedded ARJ100.EXE in the ZIP file.
