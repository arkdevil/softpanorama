Several classlib\include\*.h have #include "foo.h" rather than <foo.h>.
This will only cause a problem if you have an indentically named header file
in your current working directory (#include "file.h" starts in current dir,
then searches the "standard places"; <file.h> only searches standard places).
Note that TC++ by default doesn't find the classlib header files; if you want
it to, add the line to turboc.cfg:  -IC:\TC\CLASSLIB\INCLUDE


Some include files have #ifndef __FILENAME_H, others have #ifndef _FILENAME_H.
(inconsistent #leading underscores).  See for example sortable.h vs set.h, etc.


TCCNVT.EXE (the configuration file converter) isn't in the distribution.


`make -n' looks for and reads `builtins.mak' ONLY if it's in the current dir.
Naturally this is a bug, since make can't give an accurate picture of what a
real `make' would do without the macros and implicit rules in `builtins.mak'.


<iostream.h> always includes <mem.h> which slows compilation some.  In fact
<iostream.h> doesn't need `NULL', and only needs memcpy() if _BIG_INLINE_ is
defined, which will probably be rare.  Therefore the line
        #include <mem.h>        // to get memcpy and NULL
can be replaced with:
        #ifdef _BIG_INLINE_
        #include <mem.h>        // to get memcpy
        #endif
Since nearly everything includes <iostream.h>, and since relatively few things
will want _BIG_INLINE_, this should be a winner.  Note however that some code
might assume <iostream.h> pulls in <mem.h>.


<iomanip.h> needs <iostream.h> but doesn't get it.  Add this to <iomanip.h>:
        #ifndef __IOSTREAM_H
        #include <iostream.h>
        #endif


There is no <new.h>.  I constructed the following work-alike.  It should go
into your standard include directory (where <iostream.h> is, for example):
	// new.h

Bug in istream: an extremely common C++ main input loop is something like:
		while (cin >> chunk) chunk.do_something();
This works under the condition that istream::operator void* returns 0 (false)
after the input stream reads past EOF (or encounters an error).  TC++'s
iostream.h is consistent with its documentation [programmer's guide p.183] in
stating that this operator returns 0 only when istream::fail() is true (when
failbit, badbit or hardfail are set), but unfortunately `fail' doesn't get
set after you've read past EOF.  The correct operation is to return 0 (false)
on the read after you've run into EOF as well [Lippman p.384], which CAN BE
accomplished by the _bad bit being set wnen seeking past end-of-file [Lippman
p.402].  This can be fixed by changing "ios::operator void*()" in <iostream.h>
as follows:
	inline _Cdecl ios::operator void* ()
	{ return (state & (eofbit|failbit|badbit|hardfail)) ? 0 : this; }
NB: the `official' (if there is such a thing in these pre-ANSI-C++ days)
behavior of istream::operator>> isn't clear.  I've discussed this matter with
both Borland, and with a collegue who is in charge of certain C++ libraries
inside AT&T, and no one is yet sure what is really ``supposed'' to happen.
The above patch (checking the eofbit) appears to work correctly, but it may
be that a more comprehensive solution is eventually in order.  In any event,
most people's code doesn't run around checking individual bits inside an ios,
so the above is probably `safe'.


There is an error in TCC that isn't in TC (they generate different code).
[Borland is as surprised that they'd behave differently as I was; I'd imagine
the internals are identical, and this assumption has be confirmed by Borland].
When a virtual fn is called from a non-virtual inline member, the virtualness
of the call vanishes.  Compile the following with `tcc -vi':
        #include <iostream.h>
        class B {
        public:
          virtual void virt();
          void nonvirt() { cout << "B::nonvirt() calling "; virt(); }
        };
        class D : public B {
        public:
          void virt();
        };
        main()
        {
          D d;
          (&d)->nonvirt();  // B::nonvirt() should call D::virt()
          d.nonvirt();      // ditto
        }
        void B::virt() { cout << "B::virt()\n"; }
        void D::virt() { cout << "D::virt()\n"; }
Unfortunately both of these call B::nonvirt().
Ie:Both d.nonvirt() & (&d)->nonvirt() translate to "call near ptr @B@virt$qv".
Obviously these should be virtual function calls.  This is a serious error, as
calling a virtual from a non-virtual is fairly common.  Note: if B::virt() is
a pure virtual (another legal operation, but perhaps not as common), the call
to "@B@virt$qv" generates a linker error (there is no B::virt()!).  If
B::nonvirt() is a regular (non-inline) function (either by moving it out of
the class, or by `-v' or `-vi-'), TCC generates the correct code.  Strangely
enough, TC appears to *always* generate the correct code.


The 1.2 streams package (called <stream.h>) is nice, however AT&T treats the
inclusion of <stream.h> as an alias to <iostream.h>.  Therefore you should
rename it from <stream.h> to <oldstream.h>, and let <stream.h> simply be:
		#include <iostream.h>
It is notable that a number of posters on comp.lang.c++ have been confused by
including <stream.h> thinking they were getting <iostream.h>...


<generic.h>: Instead of using the usual "name2" style macros, Borland
invented their own set of macros for concatenating pieces of names.  Any code
using the Stroustrup-style macros (eg. code compatable with g++, CC, or
Zortech C++) will break.  A work-around is to stick the following on the
bottom of your <generic.h>:
			#define name2 _Paste2
			#define name3 _Paste3
			#define name4 _Paste4

TC++ signals a compiler error when the LAST default parameter for a
constructor is initialized by a constructor for some other class.  A
workaround is to add an extra dummy default parameter of some
predefined type like int.  Ex: if A and B are classes, then:
This will be an error:		A::A(B b = B(...));
But this is ok:			A::A(B b = B(...), int dummy=0);

When an object is created as a side effect of an expression, and the expression
is short-circuited, the destructor for the object seems to get called anyway:
	class X {
	public:
	  X   create_copy_of_X() { return *this; }	//Return *BY VALUE*
	  int whatever();
	  //...
	};
	main()
	{
	  X x;
	  //...
	  if (0 && x.create_copy_of_X().whatever()) stmt;
	  //...
	}
At the close of main(), TC++ calls a destructor on the copy of `x' even though
the copy was never properly constructed.  This only happens when inline functns
are NOT inlined.  Thanks to: Jamshid Afshar/jamshid@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu
