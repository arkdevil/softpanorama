Some things come ONLY from experience.  I thought that's what this echo was all 
about...more experienced users sharing with us "rookies".

I heartily concur with your statements Scott!  Yes, I have the manuals, yes I 
did BUY the program, but as a new user DV can be VERY confusing at times.  
Things work, then I change something and what used to work don't work no more!  
Also, there's the TIME factor.  One of the reasons I got DV in the first place 
was to make more efficient use of my time.  If I'm d/l'ing a file why should I 
have my system tied up while that goes on?  Now that doesn't happen any more.  
Here's my system setup:

386SX with 4MB RAM
80MB HD; 5.25 and 3.5 HDFD; VGA; Irwin 80MB external tape drive

I've seen messages here recently to indicate that it was possible to do a tape 
backup in the background.  That would be a real plus.  At present I go out of DV 
to DOS and do the backup manually.  Since I ALWAYS have the "verify files after 
copying" turned on (I'm the paranoid sort <grin>) it usually takes about an hour 
to do the backup.  If I could do the backup while I was doing something else 
(say backup drive C: while I was working on drive D: or E:) it would make things 
go much smoother.

Any thoughts on this??

How quaint.  Suppose that the person asking for help doesn't understand 
what the manual says, or cannot find the information that you refer them 
to?  Does that make them a pirate?  Moreover, who appointed you "keeper 
of the laws?"
 
I discourage piracy with all of my heart and soul; being a consultant 
and programmer, it hits me DIRECTLY IN THE POCKET when someone pirates. 
That's no excuse for your attitude, however.
 
You don't want to type, don't.  Someone else will invariably jump in and 
offer the assistance that was requested (and was requested politely, I 
might add.)  If that person legitimately purchased a copy of the 
software (from ANY source) and did not receive a manual with it, then 
they are still entitled to assistance, whether you believe so or not.

 MM=>This is joke right?  What would you do if you asked your minister for 
 MM=>some solace in a problem and he told you to look on page 365 of the 
 MM=>bible? 

Our pastor does exactly that in many instances.  I see nothing wrong with it.

 MM=>People ask for help in this echo, because they are A) Either too lazy 
 MM=>to look up the answers or B) Do not understand the technical nature of 
 MM=>what they have read.  Take a good look at some of the messages you

 MM=>1/3 of them make little or no sense. 

or C) they have a pirated copy.  You are right about some of the messages making 
little or no sense.  Yours certainly falls in that category.

 MM=>This is a very new and fast growing field.  It is hard enough for me 
 MM=>as a dealer (and confessed computer nerd) to keep up with all the 
 MM=>hardware and software changes. To expect rank novices to understand 
 MM=>the internal architecture differences between machines (this I notice 
 MM=>seems to be 
 MM=>the most problematic area) is unrealistic. 

Most of the questions have little relationship to this area. 

 MM=>Why is it that you and others of your conviction seem to think that it 
 MM=>is your right and responsibilty to protect Quarterdeck from loss? 

Because it is both morally right and legally one's duty.

 MM=>For your and others edification, the odd's are that if a person does 
 MM=>have a "pirate" copy of a program, they also own the manuals.  Quite a 
 MM=>few of these come from Hong Kong. Where they copy everything, manuals 
 MM=>and all. Piracy is done to make money.  It is not piracy to get a copy 
 MM=>of a program from a friend for free. It maybe a copyright infringement 
 MM=>but the Sony VCR case has done alot to set case law in that area. 
 MM=>Piracy is a criminal act of fraud, prosecutable by the courts. 
 MM=>Copyright infringement is a cival matter and can only be dealt with 
 MM=>through a law suit. 

You are kidding, aren't you?  Most of the pirated copies are diskcopies, zipped 
files, etc.  Very few are sold with manuals.  Very, very few.  And it absolutely 
is theft (or piracy) to get a copy of a program from a friend or anyone else for 
that matter other than the author/publisher.  It is a criminal theft, not a 
civil matter.  If you don't think so, tell me your address and phone number and 
list the stolen software you are using.  One of my users is a Federal Agent.  He 
will be glad to have the information.

 MM=>No one liked the tattle tale in school, and no one likes them now. 
 MM=>Remember when you point your finger at another, three fingers point 
 MM=>back at you. 

All the above paragraph is true.  However, there is a difference between 
tattling and fulfilling one's duty as a citizen.  You may not like me if I 
report you for piracy.  Tough shit.  I will be able to shave in the morning.  If 
I shut up, I won't.  If I can prove it, I will report it.

  Mike,
  First, let me say that though I did not quote the entire 
message, I fully agree with your stand.
  I do not wish to engage in casuistic debate over terminology, 
which I prefer to leave to the lawyers whose careers are built on 
it.
  That said, though, I think most folks who buy and use 
commercial copies of software, and who conscientiously register 
shareware, would consider those who make themselves their own 
copies of copyrighted, for-profit software and use it thus to be 
sailing in the same low-life boat as the pirates, call them what 
you may, and are pirates to the rest. >:-(
  P.S., please don't tease me about my tagline, Hector is getting 
his fee. |-)
  Since this is a DesqView echo, though, I'll ask a question I've 
been wondering about: do you think that it's worth upgrading from 
DesqView 2.26/QEMM 5.0 to DesqView 2.3/QEMM 5.1 even though I 
never come near Widows? What might be my advantage? Particularly 
when DOS 5 gets debugged, which appears imminent, it seems to me 
that QOS will have to release yet another version.
