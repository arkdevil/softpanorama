AT!.DOC -- Documentation file

Authors:
         Alexander Dudarenko & Dmitry Kohmanyuk,
                Kiev State University

Purpose:
        This program allows you to vary the speed of your computer using 
        two hot keys:  Right Shift + Gray Plus  and  Right Shift + Gray 
        Minus.

Size:
        987 bytes

Usage:
        In current version, there are no command-line parameters.  From 
        DOS prompt, just type:

          AT! <Enter>

        The program will be installed resident in RAM.

        To remove it, use RELEASE (or something like that) or simply 
        reboot your system.

        WARNING: If you start AntiTurbo twice, then you'll have control 
        with only second copy; if you start program, decrease speed, and 
        start it second time, you can't increase speed to original! 
        (Remove second copy from memory, and it'll be o'kay).

Activate:
       Use two hot keys:

         Right Shift + Gray Minus will slow work of your machine by 40% 
         of 4.77 MHz PC XT.

         Right Shift + Gray Plus will speed up the computer again by 
         same 40% each time.

Deactivate:
       Use RELEASE or other such a program.  IMPORTANT!  After unloading 
       AT! from memory, you will be adviced to run EWOFF.COM program for
       cancelling time wasting request to BIOS (INT 15h, Cancel Event
       Wait).

System requirements:
       Need PC AT, PC XT 286, or any computer with BIOS that handles INT 
       15h, function 83h (Set Interval).

Notes:
      This program takes interrupts 9, 15h and 70h.

Special Features (upgraded from version 1.0):

      -- Keyboard re-interception block (AT! works in DIGGER, also);

      -- No conflict with other software which uses INT 15h (like 
      ESNAKE.COM, also available from Compact Soft -- the smallest game 
      for EGA you have -- only 1516 bytes of code will brings you a real 
      joy!);


FUTURE versions will include:

      -- Command-line speed switch;
      -- 'Display current speed' option;
      -- Auto-detection itself in memory (will display message
      'AntiTurbo already installed');

      And what else?..
      We asked users to call authors. Your opinion is VERY important!

This program is NOT copy protected.  It is NOT allowed to distribute it 
for commercial profit.

Work at AT is a pleasure, of cource; but sometimes you REALLY want old 
fair 100% speed PC, aren't you?
