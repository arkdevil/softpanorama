                       DIET version 1.44
              ------  by Teddy Matsumoto ---------
           *******************************************

1.0.  OVERVIEW.

DIET.EXE reduces the disk-storage space that executable and data
files need WITHOUT giving up immediate access to such files.
DIET is a Freeware Program.

  (a)   When DIET compresses an EXECUTABLE file (.EXE or .COM),
        it adds a header that automatically expands the file when
        it is executed.

  (b)   DIET reduces the size of the average .EXE & .COM files by
        40%.

  (c)   Self-expansion of DIETed .EXE & .COM files is so fast
        that it is difficult to measure the change in the speed
        of file execution.  You certainly won't notice any
        change.

  (d)   The self-expanding feature of DIET is similar to PKLITE
        or LZEXE, but DIET also lets you compress overlay files,
        which PKLITE and LZEXE cannot do.

What makes DIET unique is its ability to compress DATA Files and
to automatically expand them when you call them into an editor to
read or change them.

  (a)   To use that feature, you must load DIET as a TSR file.

  (b)   DIET reduces the size of an average Data File by 2/3rd.

  (c)   DIET's automatic expansion of Data Files adds a little
        time (about 3 sec. when loading a 100k byte unDIETed text
        file into an editor).  But that is a small price for the
        benefit of being able to keep infrequently-used Data
        Files on your Hard Disk, instead of storing them on
        floppies. And you can optionally set up DIET so that it
        will recompress Data Files when you exit your Editor.

This document is the USER'S GUIDE for DIET v.1.44.  To learn
about DIET's internals and changes from version to version, see
DIETAPI.DOC and DIETTECH.DOC  That much more technical document is
of no importance to the average USER of DIET, but is available 
for programmers and the curious. DIETTECH.DOC is not included in
this package, since complete approved documentation in English is
not prepared yet.


2.0.  A QUICK INTRODUCTION TO DIET CAN DO.

  Familiar filenames of DOS are of three types, roughly speaking.
   Executable Files with Extensions .COM or .EXE.
   Device Drivers with Extensions .SYS or .DRV
   and other
   Data files with various extensions as .DAT,.DOC,.TXT etc.

  DIET compresses Executables and Drivers to files of the same
  nature so that you can execute or call from CONFIG.SYS as
  Device Drivers as they were. Let me call these files of type
  Self-eXtracting.

  You can DIET other data files too, but you can not use them
  unless you decompress by DIET manually or by TSR DIET auto-
  matically. Let me call these files as Data type.

  To compress your files on the current directory, you just type:
      DIET filename
  or with wildcard:
      DIET *.*
  There are some options in DIET, but without any otption,
  Diet compress executables and drivers into SFX type and
  other files into Data type. To see the effect of compression
  type:
      DIET -l.
  You will see all the files in your current directory with those
  compressed filenames in reverse color. To restore your files,
  type
      DIET -r.
  You will note some of the files are left DIETED. They are SFX
  type files. Try some command to assure you that an exectable
  file works as you type the command from the compressed size,
  hence the name Self-eXtracting.

  An application package consists of executables and data files
  which are called and used by executables. The simplest use
  of DIET is, you compress only executables and let data files
  stay as they are. You can do this by 'DIET *.*' ,'DIET -r '.

2.1  DIET in Terminate and Stay Resident Mode.
  
We assume you're displaying this file on your console, using the
DOS MORE command, Vernon Buerg's LIST.COM, or your favorite
Editor.  Try the following:

  (a)   Return to DOS.

  (b)   Execute:
                            DIET DIET144.DOC
        That will compress this file.  If you now try view the
        file with MORE, or read it with LIST or your favorite
        editor, you'll get garbage.

  (c)   Now Execute:
                                 DIET -Z
        That will load DIET as a TSR, which allows you to display
        DIET144.DOC with MORE, LIST, or your Editor.

  (d)   Remove the DIET TSR by executing:
                                DIET -ZR

  (e)   Finally, unDIET DIET144.DOC by executing:
                          DIET -RA DIET144.DOC


3.0.  DIET's BASIC OPTIONS:

      The basic DIET command structure is:
                  DIET [options] [file_names].

      (You may use either '-' or '/' as the option-prefix)

                        (Wildcards are OK in filenames)

   Multiple options need a space between them, e.g:
                       DIET -Z -P -TD:\tmp

      Options are classified into two categories:
         Basic options to specify DIET functions,
         Auxiliary otpions to control basic options.

Summary of Options.
         Main and auxiliarly options are tabulated below.

3.2.  File Compression/Decompression

When Diet is executed without a basic option but with a filename, the
named file will be compressed.

      DIET [auxiliary option] filename [filename(s)].

You can name options:
   -X     Compress as SFX type.
  -XC     Compress a .COM file as SFX .COM file. If you don't specify
          -XC, you will get an .EXE file out of COM file.
   -G     A large SFX header is created on the top so that you may get
          a Greater speed of decompression
   -D     Compress into Data type.
   -B     DIET compares size in Byte count.
   -K     DIET compresses files upon termination, not while in execution.
   -I     Ignore warning "may be overlay files!"
   -Oxxxx Specify file name or path name of Output.
   -A     Attribute  is readonly.
 No Option  .EXE files and .COM files into SFX type. 
            .SYS files are not compressed.
            Other extensions are compressed as DATA type.

    You may specify Data types with Options -D and -X,see below.

   -X  As a default, DIET recognizes as device drivers all files
       with the extensions "SYS" or "DRV" and does NOT compress
       them.
       If you want to DIET a Device Driver, you must make it
       self-extracting (because you won't have DIET in memory as
       a TSR until you load it as a TSR in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
       file). You can force DIET to add a self-extracting header
       to any file by using the -T option.  But see also option
       -I, above.
       -X tells DIET to add a self-extracting header regardless
       of filetype extension.  Primary use is to compress Device
       Drivers (e.g., ????.SYS or ????.DRV) so that their DIETed
       versions can be included in the CONFIG.SYS files.
       In the CONFIG.SYS file, you must o

   -D  DIET compress every file as a data type, .COM and .EXE
       files, too. If you have DIET on TSR mode, DIET will
       extract original files and will run them. What's the benefit
       you can get?
       First you can compress a file to be loaded high in memory.
       e.g., ADDDRV.exe, which flags for -I options usually, and
       which you can't run even if you succeed with -I option.

       There are files with many overlays which normally require
       extra memories to load. You can normally load such files
       by compressing overlays as data files.

       This is a minor point, but you may save a little header space
       by compressing as data files.

   -G  DIET adds a faster SFX header, some 100 bytes extra, to
       DIETed files. You can get faster decompression by this
       option. If 100 extra bytes would not change the DIETed
       file size, you had better compress with this option.

   -XC DIET compresses a xxxx.COM file into xxxx.EXE file.
       This is to make executables to have more robust structure,
       since SFX header is attached to the top of the file.
       However, if you insist on the same name for unDIETed
       and DIETed, you may specify this switch to get .COM file
       out of .COM file.

       The size of DIETed .COM file is smaller than .EXE file,
       hence there is certin merit like being loadable into UMB.
       Do not put too much trust on this switch, because the
       behavior of such a .COM file may be unpredictable.

   -B  MS-DOS manages files with cluster as a unit. For a High-
       Density 5.25" disk, 1 cluster consists of 1,024 bytes.
       Hence a file with size 10,300bytes and another with
       11,000bytes occupy 11 clusters on a disk space. If DIET
       tried to compress the later and get the former, DIET aborts
       compression since the number of clusters are the same for
       compressed and uncompressed files.

       However, there are cases where you archive these files into
       a file with say TAR.exe or LHA.exe with no compress option.
       Then you have chances to get one or more clusters in size of
       the archive.
      
       DIET aborts compression when it meets a file of size less
       than a cluster. Specify -B option to let DIET compares the
       compressed size in Byte size.
          
   -K  Kill temporary Files Only on Quitting Program. DIET's TSR
       opens a temporary file whenever it lets a program like an
       editor open a compressed file.  That temporary file is
       erased when the program closes the file. Some programs
       open, close, and reopen files frequently, e.g. a Help
       Message file.  That can be very time consuming.  To avoid
       that, use the -K option -- then the temporary files will
       be erased ONLY when you quit the main program from which
       the DIETed files were expanded. You may watch -K option
       in action with editors calling child processes or with some
       communication software with overlay protocol files.

       An adversary effect of this option is that you have many
       temporary files on your temporary directory. Refer -N, and
       -$ options in autocompression mode.

   -I  Ignore warnings.  DIET ordinarily refuses to compress
       files with overlays when the size of the file in EXEHDR
       information is not the same as its actual size, or when
       the file is to be loaded in high memory like ADDDRV.exe.
       And DIET reports 'may be overlay file', or "to be loaded
       high". Since DIET can use compressed overlay files if 
       operated in the TSR mode, the -I option tells DIET to 
       ignore such warnings.  

       Do NOT use the -I option if you use DIET in nonresident mode.
    
       Executable file with overlays as MS-WORKS will not behave
       properly if DIET is not active as TSR. I would recommend
       to use -D with -K option, for such files. 
       However, you might be able to run DIETed file with -I option, 
       since DIET suggests 'may be overlays'at the compression.
       You may try this option first if you prefer to use DIET
       non-TSR.

       Files to be loaded high as device drivers, flag for -I 
       option. You may DIET them with -I option, but you may often
       lose their proper working area on High Memory Blocks.
       Again you had better use DIET as TSR and DIET them with
       -D option.

   -Oxxxx  By default, DIET overwrites the files it compresses 
       (or uncompresses).  If you want to save the uncompressed
       (or compressed) file, use the -O option to put the changed
       file into another directory.  To illustrate:

       Example 1. You are NOT logged into DRIVE A:.  You want a
       compressed version of A:ALPHA.DAT in your default
       directory:
                          DIET -O A:alpha.dat.

       Example 2. You want to compress ALPHA.DAT in your default
       directory and store the compressed file in directory
       C:\TMP
                        DIET -OC:\tmp\ alpha.dat
                 (note the positions of the spaces and back slashes!!)


   -A  Set Read-Only Attribute.  This is a safety measure for
       users who do not always keep DIET in memory as a TSR.  If
       you were to call a DIETed file into your editor without
       DIET in memory, it is possible that your editor could lock
       up.  To restart you'd have to reboot, and you could lose
       your DIETed data file. By using the -A option, you make
       any DIETed file Read-Only.  Few users will need to use the
       -A option, but it's there for those who want to be extra
       safe.

File Restoration or uncompression.
 General format is:
   DIET -[ R | RA ] [ Option ] Filename [Filename(s)]

    -R  decompresses all named files that were compressed as DATA
        files (normally, all files that do NOT have EXE or COM
        extensions).

   -RA  restores ALL named files, including files that when
        compressed received a self-extracting header (normally,
        the *.EXE & &.COM files).

 By the nature of Data types, you may have to compress/decompress
frequently, while executables and device drivers are seldom needed
to recompression. Especially when DIET is non-resident you have to
restore many files using wild cards. Design of -R and -RA option
is done to decrease the number of manual operations in non-TSR mode.


3.2   USING DIET FOR COPYING FILES COMPRESSED/DECOMPRESSED
 To copy files as Compressed, or be compressed, General format is:

    DIET -Cxxxx [option] filename [filename(s)]

 Available options are the same as with the case of compression.

 This function is similar to -Oxxxx, but difference lies in the
 fact that uncompressed files are compressed, already compressed
 files are copied as they are, and files DIET failed to compress
 are copied as they are.

 When DIET finds a file with the same name, DIET compares the
 Time Stamp and overwrite existing file if it older and abort 
 if it is newer than the specified file.

 Recommended use of this function is to expand an application
 package on High Speed Device from your floppy disks, and  to
 restore the package to the original storage with some of the
 files transacted.

 To copy files with decompression, the general format is:

      DIET -R -Cxxxx  filename [ filename(s)]
      DIET -RA -Cxxxx filename [ filename(s)].

 Specified files are expanded in the specified directory xxxx
 with unDIETed. You may copy and expand files in a low speed
 device like a floppy disk, to a highspeed device, as a ramdisk
 with this command.

   -C  Copying DIETed files with DIET's TSR in memory takes extra
       time because DIETed files are automatically decompressed
       before copying and recompressed after copying.  You can
       suppress that by using DIET with the -C option to copy
       files. The syntax is:
                    DIET -C<destination> <FILENAMEs>

       Example 1.  To copy all files (including compressed files)
       in the current directory of C:\ to Drive A:
                           DIET -CA:\ C:\*.*

       Example 2.  To copy compressed files in drive A: to Drive
       C:\ and simultaneously decompress them:
                         DIET -RA -CC:\ A:\*.*
       (But see also DIETOFF Environment Variable, below)


3.3   USING DIET TO VIEW DIETED AND UNDIETED FILES.

   -L  presents a directory listing for the default disk, with
       the DIETed files in reverse color.  An "*" means the file
       has a self-extracting header, and a "#" means it is a
       compressed DATA files.  Wildcard filenames are OK, e.g.,

             DIET -L *.dat *.txt

       When you want to specify a directory, put an extra '\' at
       the end of the path name like:

             DIET -L c:\dos\

       which is the same with

             DIET -L c:\dos\*.*

       with -L option.

   -!  makes a self-check of DIET.EXE's internal integrity.

   -H  checks the CRC for file integrity, and presents data about
       DIETed files, i.e., Original File Size and Type, & reports
       if the -K option was used.

   -J  If you have DOS/V 5.0 from IBM Japan and can read Japanese,
       this options gives you data your disk's health status.  If
       not, ignore this option.
 
   -?  Display the list of options.



3.4.  USING DIET AS A TSR FOR AUTOMATIC DECOMPRESSION.
 
 General syntax for making DIET Terminate and Stay Resident is:

   DIET -Z   [options]
   DIET -Z0  [options]
   DIET -Z1  [options]
   DIET -Z2  [options].

 Available options are:
       -P     automatated recompression of DIETed file.
       -W     automated compression of newly created file.
       -N     disable automated [re]compressions.
       -M     suppress messages in automated compression.
       -S     display decompressed file size.
       -Txxxx specify temporary file directory.
       
     DIET -Z loads DIET into memory as a TSR. When there is a space
             in UMB, DIET first tries to stay there. Whenever XMS
             memory is availabel, DIET will load itself in extended
             memory with DOS 5.00. 'DIET -Z' is the same with 'DIET -Z1'

     DIET -Z[n] tells DIET how to use Expanded Memory, if present. 
          -Z0 do not use Expanded Memory (same as -Z alone)
          -Z1 use Expanded Memory for DIET's temporary files.
          -Z2 use Expanded Memory for both DIET's temporary files
              and for most of DIET's resident code, too.  If you
              have enough Expanded Memory, -Z2 uses only about 1.6k
              bytes of conventional memory.
             
              When DIET has already been resident, only the auxiliarly
              options have meaning. Z[n] does nothing to TSR DIET.

                 Notes:  If you compress COMMAND.COM or some overlay
                 files, you must make DIET resident in memory.
                         Regular users of DIET should include DIET -Z
                 in their AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
                         You can also load DIET as a Device Driver, e.g.,
                                  DEVICE=DIET.EXE -Z2 -P -K
                 That uses a few additional bytes of memory, but allows
                 you to DIET Device Drivers (to save disk space).  If you
                 have large or many Device Drivers, that may be useful.

        -ZD   disables DIET in memory, but leaves it loaded.
        -ZA   restores DIET after -ZD has been used.
        -ZR   removes DIET from memory.  But don't do that if you loaded
              other TSR's after DIET.

              Note:  DIET's TSR function may be disabled if you use
              ^C or ^Break while DIET is executing, or by certain
              interrupts.  If DIET's TSR function disappears for an
              unknown cause, try  DIET -ZA to restore it.


   -P   DIET's default mode does not re-compress data files that
       are changed after being into loaded and manipulated by a
       program such as an Editor or a Spreadsheet.  DIET\ \%-P
       enables automatic recompression.
       But whether or not DIET can automatically recompress such
       data file files depends on the internal workings of your
       Editor or other program. It does work with ???.WQ1 files
       in QUATTRO.  It does not work for ???.DBF files in dBASE
       (in fact, dBASE 
      
   -W  will automatically DIET all newly-created files, including
       any temporary files that your programs may create.  That
       can be useful but can also waste a lot of time.  To assure
       this option does not become a nuisance, use the NODIET
       Environmental Variable to suppress DIETing of files like
       *.OBJ, *.LZH, etc. Or use -N otpion together, and later
       issue the command

          DIET -$
       
       See the option -$.
       In the CONFIG.SYS file, you must of course give the
       driver's full name, e.g.,
          DEVICE=?????.SYS).

   -M  If you don't want DIET to give you a message about what it
       is doing to your file, suppress the message with -M
   
   -N  With -P or -W options specified, DIET automatically
       compress newly created files and decompressed files
       opened with READ and Write mode. You are not aware of
       the time and types of these compressed files. By specying
       this option, you may restrain DIET from auto-compression
       and with -$ option, compress them later with the same time
       stamp as TSR DIET tried to compress them.
       
       With -P option SFX or Data type inherit those of the originals
       and with -W option, you may specify types by switches.
   

   -S  Some application programs read in a specified amount of
       data from overlay files, and get confused if those
       overlays have been DIETed.  By specifying the -S option
       when dieting such overlays, that confusion is avoided.

   -T  In its default mode, DIET stores in the default directory
       certain temporary files that it creates and needs . If you
       use the Environment Variable  TMP=???, DIET will attempt
       to store its temporary files in the directory that you've
       defined as ???. -T option overrides the TMP environmental
       variable. You may define the directory in AUTOEXEC.BAT by:
           DIET -Z2 -P -K -TD:\tmp1\
       DO NOT FORGET THE LAST "\" IN THIS OPTION.
       
       I strongly recommend you to define temporary directory
       especially when you have a high speed device like a
       Ramdisk.

USING DIET as a DEVICE DEIVER.
 DIET.exe is an executable program and is a device driver at
 the same time. You may load DIET as a DEVICE DRIVER in your
 config.sys as:

   DEVICE = DIET.EXE  -Z   [ options ]
   DEVICE = DIET.EXE  -Z0  [ options ]
   DEVICE = DIET.EXE  -Z1  [ options ]
   DEVICE = DIET.EXE  -Z2  [ options ]

or in your AUTOEXEC.BAT as:

   DIET.EXE  -Z   [ options ]
   DIET.EXE  -Z0  [ options ]
   DIET.EXE  -Z1  [ options ]
   DIET.EXE  -Z2  [ options ]



3.5.  Environment Variables.
 In DOS versions 3.xx or above, DIET uses the following
 environment variable strings, if they are present.  You create
 them (usually from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file) as follows:
                     SET NameOfEnvVar = data



DIETOPT  allows you to define the options you want to use as a
       default, e.g.,
                           SET DIETOPT=-D -K
       will use option -D and -K whenever a file is DIETed.
       
       Options you can set are: -J,-I,-D,-G,-K,-P,-W,-N,and -S.

DIETOFF This is the unique variable TSR DIET refers.
       TSR DIET has versatile abilities which consequently has
       some adversary effect in use. Take copy command e.g.,
       the command line entry  'copy file1 file2'
       first decompresses file1 to file2.tmp and then compresses
       it to file2. You may type 'DIET OFF' to disable DIET
       temporarily, which is time consuming. If you register
       COMMAND.COM among DIETOFF string, you can avoid this manual
       typing.
 
       For some programs you may prefer to disable DIET, e.g.,
       to speed up file copying without having to use Option -C
       (see above).  By including an environment string as below,
       you tell DIET's TSR not to do what it usually would do
       with DIETed files:
           SET DIETOFF=COMMAND.COM;FC.COM;DUMP.EXE;XCOPY.EXE;LHA.EXE
       You don't need to specify a Path for the files -- DIET is
       concerned only with the programs' names.

NODIET  You should suppress DIETing of some files, e.g., archives
       like *.LZH and *.ZIP, and temporary intermediate files
       created by some application programs.  You can also tell
       DIET to ignore all files in specified directories -- if
       your NODIET string ends with a Directory name, be sure to
       append a "\".  There is a limit of 10 NODIET entries.
       Example:
            SET NODIET=*.LZH;*.ZIP;*.OBJ;C:\TMP\;c:\c600\
       will suppress DIETing of all *.LZH, *.ZIP, *.OBJ files,
       and of all files in director C:\TMP and C:\C600.

  TMP  Define storage area for DIET's Temporary Files by putting
       into your AUTOEXEC.BAT a line like:
                          SET TMP=E:y\DirName
       See also Option -T.

       NOTE: When you use DIET in resident mode, it creates and
       use  TMP  Define storage area for DIET
       uses temporary files with names such as __DIET__.??? Such
       files are automatically erased when DIET finishes its
       tasks, but if you boot your system or stop DIET's
       execution by Ctrl-Break, those files may remain on your
       disk.  You may erase any such files.



4.0. Hints for Effective Use of DIET.
  Don't allow DIET to be memory-resident when using programs
like SPEEDDSK, OPTIMIZE, DOG, or other HardDisk managers.
Disable DIET by executing DIET -ZD when you use such programs!!
In fact, you're always best off by clearing ALL TSRs before using
such programs.


4.1. DIET in non-Resident Mode.
 There are no special things you have to remember when you use DIET.
 Register filenames you don't want to compress in NODIET variable to
 gain speed, *.LZH and *.ZIP must be in your list. Do not try to
 compress file with -I otption if DIET flag for overlays. You had
 better have a batch file such as APP.bat when APP.exe and APP.HLP
 are DIETED in you storage:
  "
   rem Auto-decompression and execution of APP.exe
   echo DO not forget to recompress APP.HLP 
   diet -r APP.HLP
   APP
  ."

 When you have a high-speed device such as a RAMDISK, you had better
 copy your applications decompressing and run your program on RAMDISK.
 Suppose you have an application package in a Floppy Disk A:, and
 You have a sufficient space in your RAMDISK D:.
     DIET -R -CD: A:*.*
 Then after you quit running, you type:
     DIET -CA: D:*.*
 to copy all of your aplication program while compressing to A:
 as DIETing is carried on. New Data files and revised files will
 be stored on the diskette in the disk drive A:.

 Laptop Users, you are the target of this software. The file overwriting
 mode of DIET is designed for you to make most of your limited storage
 space. Try to leave a room for decompressed files, and design your own
 batch file to use the minimum amount of your files decompressed.
 
    
4.2. DIET in Resident Mode.

 Specify TMP environmental string always if you have a high-speed
 RAMDISK to decrease the number of disk accesses if available. You
 must, also, know that you have a sufficient space for the temporary
 files to be made by DIET.

 When you see a message like: "Can't find abc.exe" even though the 
 file exists.  This is usually the result of DIET being unable to find 
 enough space in your temporary directory for its temporary files. 
 Check your space if you see this message.

 DIETOPT variables will refrain DIET to make some adverary effects
 like copying after decompression and compressing after copying.
 Well, if you set DIETOPT=COMMAND.COM, they you can't type a
 DIETED file unless you put and SFX header to the date file.
 You must take a balance for yourself. Please make experiments
 on -P, -W and -K options, and choose the combination fit you best.

 A word processor ordinarily takes the raw file formatted into
 a form you like. And it makes auxiliary files for formatting or
 for controling your printer. Everytime you change a line or two
 wordprocessor must compress and decompress these files if you
 don't specify -K option. With this option set, these temporary
 formatting files are DIETed once for all.

 If you have a sufficient room for the temporary directory, you
 have to set -K all the time. If you don't have enough room,
 you have to choose carefully the filenames for which K option
 works.

 -P option is a must if you have DIET as TSR. With a suitable
 combination with -K option, you can always have compressed file
 automatically re-compressed. You will see there DIET on action.
 You will love to see it or you may suppress DIET messages with -M.
 Sometimes DIET start working when you call the program again,
 but this is not a BUG.

 Executable file in Overlay mode can be run if DIET is in TSR active.
 I would recommend -D option with -K, rather than -I.

 The state of DIET options can be seen by "DIET ON" command.
 Or you may use DOS MEM.exe or PMAP.exe by Chris Dunford as follows:
     PMAP /e

When you have loaded DIET as a device driver, PMAP /v shows only the
place and size.



4.3. Things to Avoid in TSR mode.

 As is described before, some program returns a message like:
 "Can't find abc.exe" even though the file exists.  This is usually 
 the result of DIET being unable to find enough space in your 
 temporary directory for its temporary files. 

 There are some files which is accessed not by its file-handle. DIET
 has been revised several times to enhance tracing ability of filenames
 in file open and close, however, in certain rare cases, DIET fails
 to access exiting file.

 Do not try to run programs which rewrites FAT of Disk or DOS
 buffers. The so-called HDD optimizing programas are of this type.
 Please disable TSR DIET before the use of such programs.

 DIET tries to trace filenames even with task-swapping of DOS 5.00
 or Windows in its enhnaced mode. However, among the many application
 programs you might find some with which DIET fails to trace tasks
 swapped. Please take due precautions with task swappings.
