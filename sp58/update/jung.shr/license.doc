
     ARJ LICENSE POLICY 					April 1993


     The ARJ archiver, the REARJ program, the ARJSFX module, the ARJSFXJR
     module, the DEARJ program, the ARJR program, and the associated
     documentation are copyright (c) 1990-93 Robert K Jung, all rights
     reserved.	The ARJ software may not be circulated in any incomplete or
     modified form, nor sold for profit, without written permission of the
     author.

     If you distribute this software to others, you are required to
     distribute the ENTIRE package consisting of the following files:

     ARJ.EXE
     ARJ.DOC
     ARJ_BBS.DOC
     ARJBACK.BAT
     ARJREST.BAT
     ARJINCR.BAT
     ARJSORT.BAT
     ARJSORT.COM
     ARJSORT.DOC
     CREDIT.CRD
     ERRORS.DOC
     INTRO.DOC
     LICENSE.DOC
     ORDERFRM.DOC
     README.DOC
     REARJ.CFG
     REARJ.DOC
     REARJ.EXE
     REARJALL.BAT
     REGISTER.EXE
     TESTARJ.BAT
     UPDATE.DOC
     WHATSNEW.DOC
     WHY_ARJ.DOC

     We strongly prefer that the files be distributed in the format
     originally released: ARJ###.EXE (### = version) with the ARJ-SECURITY
     envelope as created by the author.  If you must distribute the ARJ
     archive in another archive format, please archive the ARJ###.EXE as
     one file inside the other archive.  Re-archival of the software as
     separate files means losing the ARJ security envelope.

     As a brief description of ARJ, we suggest the following:

     "ARJ is an archiver that produces the smallest or nearly the smallest
     archive files.  It is very fast and has a rich set of features which
     include convenient file directory handling, file generations, text
     searching, archive recovery, configurable command options, multiple
     volume archives (archives that span diskettes) and much more."

     You may NOT distribute the registered version of ARJ or the registered
     version of REARJ or any version of ARJR, and DEARJ except as noted in
     your ARJ license agreement.  ARJR is the ARJ program minus the help
     screens and SFX/SFXJR modules.  DEARJ is the ARJR program minus the
     archive modification/creation functions.  ARJR and DEARJ are available
     only to registered and licensed users.  See the ORDERFRM.DOC for
     ordering information.  Those who have made donations to ARJ may
     upgrade to a full registration with full credit for your previous
     donation(s).  Please note the previous donation on your order as a
     reminder.

     The use and/or sale of ARJ, ARJR, DEARJ, REARJ, ARJSFX, and ARJSFXJR
     (ARJ package) is subject to the following terms:


     PERSONAL USE:

     For personal use (away from the office and non-commercial), ARJ,
     ARJSFX, and ARJSFXJR may be freely used and shared with others.  There
     is no REQUIRED registration fee for non-commercial, non-business,
     non-institutional, non-government personal use.

     For personal use, the program REARJ may be freely used only by ARJ
     users.  An ARJ user is one who uses ARJ on a regular basis.  Others
     who wish to use REARJ must purchase a registration for the ARJ
     package.

     If you find the ARJ package useful, you are encouraged to register
     your copy:  INDIVIDUAL REGISTRATION ... $40 (US).

     The user who registers receives several benefits:

     * Technical support by telephone or mail.	You can get help with any
       questions or problems you encounter in using ARJ.

     * The opportunity to order the latest version of ARJ and ARJ upgrades
       on disk directly from the author.

     * The opportunity to order the latest versions of REARJ, ARJR, DEARJ,
       and UNARJ C source code.  Most of these are only available to
       registered users.

     * The satisfaction of knowing that you are supporting the development
       of good, affordable software.


     BULLETIN BOARD SYSTEM (BBS) USE:

     ARJ and REARJ may be freely used on non-commercial computer bulletin
     board systems where ARJ is one of the supported primary archive
     formats.  The use of ARJ and/or REARJ on a BBS where ARJ is not one of
     the supported primary archive formats requires a registration or site
     license.

     Support of ARJ involves allowing ARJ archives as uploads AND making
     ARJ archives available as downloads.

     A subscription BBS is not necessarily considered a COMMERCIAL BBS.  A
     BBS that is operated to make money is considered a COMMERCIAL BBS.  A
     BBS operated by a business for the purposes of the business is
     considered a COMMERCIAL BBS.


     INSTITUTIONAL/COMMERCIAL SITE LICENSE/REGISTRATION:

     Any corporation, institution, government agency or business wishing to
     use the ARJ software in the course of its internal business must
     purchase an ARJ registration or SITE LICENSE.  Any individual wishing
     to use the ARJ software within a corporation, institution, government
     agency or business must purchase an ARJ registration or SITE LICENSE.
     The SITE LICENSE is provided for those who want to use ARJ on multiple
     computers.  A sample SITE LICENSE for the internal use of the ARJ
     software is included at the end of this document.	Please see the
     ORDERFRM.DOC or write for terms.

     Any corporation, institution, government agency or business may use
     the unregistered shareware version of ARJ only for evaluation purposes
     and only for a thirty day period.	After the thirty day period, you
     must either register ARJ or discontinue its use.  If you register ARJ,
     you may continue to use the unregistered ARJ program until you receive
     the registered version.

     This internal license does NOT license the inclusion of ARJ software
     with a hardware/software package that is distributed externally.

     For the purposes of this license, a SITE is considered a group of
     computers/users provided primary technical support from one location.
     This definition of a SITE is subject to change.

     Each computer that uses ARJ, ARJSFX, or ARJSFXJR in any way requires
     licensing.  In addition, computers that are being backed up with ARJ
     via a file server require licensing.  For example, if computer Z's
     data is copied to a file server and that file server uses ARJ to
     archive Z's data, then computer Z needs to be licensed for ARJ.

     Examples of institutional or commercial use of ARJ:

     1)  Using ARJ to backup your business programs and/or data.
     2)  Using ARJ to create archives for storing or transporting business
	 data.
     3)  Using ARJ on a company supplied home computer for company
	 business.
     4)  Using ARJ to backup your research programs and/or data.
     5)  Using ARJ on your home business computer for business purposes.

     The above examples should NOT be construed as the ONLY types of
     institutional or commercial use of ARJ.


     SHAREWARE DISTRIBUTION USE BY INDIVIDUALS:

     The use of ARJ to create an ARJ format archive (*.ARJ) for the purpose
     of distributing shareware or freeware to computer bulletin board
     systems IS NOT considered commercial use.	However, any other use of
     ARJ in connection with a shareware product IS commercial use.  For
     example, using ARJ to backup shareware source code IS commercial use.

     The inclusion of the ARJSFX/ARJSFXJR modules in software to create
     self-extracting ARJ archives that are to be distributed requires a
     distribution license.


     DISTRIBUTION LICENSE:

     Standard ARJ format archives (*.ARJ) may be distributed without a
     license.  The UNARJ.EXE program distributed separately may be freely
     used and distributed without a license.

     Any corporation, institution, government agency or business wishing to
     include DEARJ, ARJSFX or ARJSFXJR (self-extracting ARJ archives) as an
     integral part of a software and/or hardware package to be distributed
     externally must purchase a DISTRIBUTION LICENSE.  The use of ARJ on
     one computer to build the software and/or hardware package is included
     in the DISTRIBUTION LICENSE.

     The above requirement does NOT apply to those who did NOT initiate
     the inclusion of the ARJ software with the software and/or hardware
     package.

     Please write for terms providing your distribution details:

     1)  Expected distribution numbers per year or in total.
     2)  The number of diskettes required before and after compression.
     3)  The approximate value/price of the package.
     4)  A brief description of the software/hardware.
     5)  A description of how ARJ will be used in the distribution.

     If you wish to use the archiver ARJ or the conversion program REARJ in
     your application software, the pricing is similar to the INTERNAL SITE
     LICENSE price schedule.  Please write for terms.


     RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONAL USE:

     To obtain the donation of a SITE LICENSE and/or DISTRIBUTION LICENSE,
     please write providing details of your organization's religious and
     charitable activities and the intended use for ARJ.  A free license
     will be provided to qualifying organizations.  Qualifications will be
     determined on a purely subjective basis.  Non-qualifying organizations
     can always obtain licenses by purchase.

     Non-religious non-profit organizations promoting causes that do not
     conflict with our personal ethics and faith may also qualify for a
     free license.


     COMMERCIAL SALE:

     Any software dealer or library may distribute the entire ARJ package
     in an unmodified form for a fee as long as the price charged for the
     disk containing ARJ does not exceed US $10.00.  You may NOT distribute
     any version of ARJR or DEARJ (not the same as UNARJ).

     With this single exception, the sale of ARJ or its parts for profit,
     either alone or together with other software or hardware, requires a
     licensing agreement possibly providing for royalty payments.
     Please write for terms.


     CUSTOM VERSIONS OF ARJ:

     Customized versions of ARJ or the self-extraction ARJSFX modules can
     be licensed.  Please write for terms describing your requirements.
     Customized versions may take a few days to several weeks or more to
     build.


     UPGRADE POLICY FOR ARJ:

     Registered/licensed users of ARJ may upgrade ARJ to the next DOT
     release (2.1 to 2.2, etc) for a small diskette fee.  See the
     ORDERFRM.DOC for details.


     UNARJ SOURCE CODE:

     Available in a separately distributed archive is the program UNARJ.EXE
     and its C source code.  UNARJ is a simple ARJ archive extraction
     program.

     You may freely use, copy, and distribute UNARJ.EXE, provided that no
     fee is charged for such use, copying or distribution.

     This source code is intended to promote the building of utilities to
     support the use of ARJ and ARJ archives.


     ARJ-SECURITY ENVELOPE USE:

     This feature is intended for but not limited to software developers
     who wish to distribute archived software with some assurance that the
     archived software in a validated ARJ-SECURED archive will be secure.
     We reserve the right to limit the distribution of ARJ-SECURITY serial
     codes.

     This feature may ONLY be used by those who have purchased an
     ARJ-SECURITY serial number.

     Please see the ORDERFRM.DOC or write for terms.
