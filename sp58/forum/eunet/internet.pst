I find it interesting that your primary concern is "could
we be sued" and not "to what extent are we responsible for
the behavior of our members?"

I would think that if the organization makes it clear in
its charter what the rights/responsibilities of its
members are, then you would CYA.

If you have a "proper use" policy and enforce it then it
would aid both in protecting you against legal action
and in reinforcing the idea that the individual is
responsible for his/her own actions.

A few months ago, there was a case of a commercial message
being sent via a ham radio packet network;
commercial messages may *not* be broadcast over ham stations.

The packet repeaters are unattended, automatic systems.

At first, the FCC held that *every* packet station which re-broadcast
this message was liable for fines and penalties.
The latest (or so I understand) is:

The FCC decided that only the operator of the 
*initial* packet repeater was liable:  
Note that this is also an unattended system; 
the originator of the message broadcast it to the local repeater, 
which sent it forward blindly.

So, it *is* conceivable that a legal authority could hold you responsible
for traffic over with which you had no direct involvement.

Well, no, our primary concern is can we get something like this up and
running at a reasonable cost.  In particular, we are interested in _all_
the costs associated with this type of service.  As one of the members
of our groups says:  "I have been sued for stupid things.  Don't
believe that good intentions and reasonable precautions prevent that."
(Yes, they do help you win the case, but anyone can sue...)


Yes, we intend to make sure every one who uses the system is well
aware of their responsibilities, but we also want to be responsible to
the University and/or any other organization that we are associated
with.  I view it very much like car insurance.  I don't intend to ever
use the liability insurance that I have, but it seems like a real good
idea to have.

The following message is being forwarded to this list...

Most of you are probably aware of a plan to limit free use of
INTERNET to "scientists" transmitting huge files and to start
charging for e-mail.  Apparently, this is the result of private
telecommunications interests putting pressure on the National
Science Foundation.

If this plan is realized, it will mean that the majority of the
approximately 15 million users of INTERNET will be cut off.
Sadly, this is occurring just when the potential of this
network
was starting to be realized.

Something must be DONE.  We can not let private interests
deprive
us of access to INTERNET.

I suggest that all concerned users register their
protest/concern
directly with Clinton and Gore via e-mail.  Their e-mail
address
have recently been posted and they are:

Clinton= PRESIDENT@WHITEHOUSE.GOV
Gore = VICE.PRESIDENT@WHITEHOUSE.GOV

In addition, I also suggest that we identify the office in the
NSF which is responsible for INTERNET and register electronic
protests with them.

Any help or suggestions would be appreciated, especially in
locating the e-mail address for the office in the NSF.

There was an article about this in a recent issue of _Science_; look in
the last month or two.  It's part of the Clinton-Gore ``electronic
superhighway'' initiative, and so far it's been confined to
inside-the-beltway lobbying that hasn't been turned into policy -- yet.
But, basically, some DC policy-makers favor forcing small
scientific/educational users onto for-profit networks, reserving the
NSF backbone for important stuff like genome sequencing and high-energy
physics data.  Think of it as a new battleground for the the Big
Science vs Little Science war.

You're not the only one who hasn't heard a thing about it -- last week
I talked to Gwen Bell, President of the ACM, who gave a talk at the LA
ACM about the Electronic Superhighway, but who also didn't seem to know
much about it either.  Perhaps it was a false alarm; but perhaps not.

Someone has evidently papered the world with "INTERNET FREE

This is the responsible office in the NSF, and I am the
responsible person.

There is no "plan to limit free use of INTERNET..."

In the first place, there is no such thing as "free use of
INTERNET". Each and every institution with Internet access pays
a service provider real money every year for the institution's
connection.  Most institutions do not however trickle those
charges down to users, but pay for them out of general
operating funds.

Service providers, most of whom serve a limited geographical
area, attain national and international coverage via the NSFNET
BackBone Service, which has hitherto been centrally funded by an
award to Merit, Inc. and provided to the regional service
providers at no charge.

Since the beginning of the current NSFNET Backbone Service in
1987, a lively and competitive commercial market in Internet
carriage has emerged, with multiple vendors offering robust,
nationwide, commodity-level services.

Continued centralized funding of a Backbone Service by the
Foundation is no longer justified, as it would place the Federal
government in direct competition with the private sector.

Awards made under the currently active solicitation will
include
awards to regional networks to purchase backbone service on the
open market.  That is, the NSF will switch from supplier funding
to user funding.

The NSF is committed to continuity of network service to the
research and education community; we will take whatever steps
are necessary to assure it.

If you want to take this up with NSF, please note the person
that
wrote the message which I forwarded to you was Stephen Wolff
<steve@cise.cise.nsf.gov>.  I would suggest a moderated /
moderate discussion, or perhaps simply asking for more
information on the NSF policy, how it is developed and how you,
as individuals and institutions, can contribute to, and have an
increased awareness of, that policy.  In particular, Michael
Giddings <giddings@moraine.chem.wisc.edu>, has initiated a
discussion and would perhaps be willing to coordinate such a
discussion with the proper indivdual at the NSF.
