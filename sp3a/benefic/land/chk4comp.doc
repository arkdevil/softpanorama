CHK4COMP.EXE  Ver. 3.05 (3-18-91) by John Land, Esq. (Patent & Copyright Law)

Shows which .EXE & .COM files have been compressed by PKLITE, LZEXE, DIET,
AXE, LEXEM, TINYPROG, SHRINK, EXECUTRIX, SCRNCH, ICE, or EXEPACK, plus ID's
WINDOWS .EXE files, overlay files, & misnamed .EXE & .COM files.  Output
sortable by size, name, date, or time, & is redirectable.  Subdirectories
can be looped through.

USAGE is:  CHK4COMP {filespec}  {/option}...   [{filespec} can take wildcards].

Listing options (can use - or / to start each option):
  /A  -- All specified files (default is all .COM and .EXE files)
  /C  -- Compressed files only; suboptions:
         /CL = Lzexe  /CP = Pklite  /CD = Diet  /CU = execUtrix /CX = leXem
         /CC = sCrnch /CS = Shrink  /CA = Axe   /CT = Tinyprog  /CI = Ice
         /CE = Exepack
  /U  -- Uncompressed files only
  /M  -- Misnamed .COM and .EXE files only (no wildcards accepted)
  /E  -- EXEPACK compression testing NOT included (speeds up testing)

Sort options:
  /S  -- by file Size (default)     /D  -- by file Date
  /N  -- by file Name               /T  -- by file Time

Other options:
  /X  -- eXclude display of all information except totals
  /L  -- Loop through subdirectories
  /P  -- Pause after each 25 lines
  /V  -- Verbose mode; shows file dates and times
  /R  -- Redirect mode; suppress most banners and file info

NOTES:   If the ▒ symbol shows in an information line for a file, then that
         file is a WINDOWS .EXE file.  If the Ё symbol shows, then that
         file APPEARS to use overlays (the calculated file size is not
         equal to the actual file size).

         You can add up to 2 strings (a before file-list string and an after
         file-list string) to redirected output.  Just put the strings in
         single quotes.  Spaces are allowed.

         EXAMPLE:  CHK4COMP /u/r 'PKlite -o'

         This will output a list of UNcompressed files preceded by 
         "PKlite -o", which can be redirected to a batch file (e.g., by
         adding ">temp.bat").

         With the /L option, all subdirectories under the current
         subdirectory are searched, but banners are shown ONLY for those
         subdirectories with files matching the initial search criteria
         (e.g., compressed *.EXE files).

         Searching for EXEPACK'd files is slow, because the tag bytes are
         in non-uniform locations near the END of a file.  However, the
         default mode INCLUDES searching for EXEPACK'd files; use /E to
         exclude them.  Note also that CHK4COMP only searches the last 64
         KB of large .EXE files for the EXEPACK tag bytes.

VERSION
NOTES: 
       2.00  -- added checking for PKlite compression of .EXE files
       2.10  -- added checking for compression of .COM files by PKLITE,
                fixed output for banner suppression (redirection /r)
                switch, added option to search ONLY for LZEXE, PKlite, or
                TINYPROG compressed files.
       2.21  -- made checking for misnamed .EXE and .COM files automatic;
                added checking for compression by DIET and SEA-AXE;
                distinguishes PKlite v. 1.00 from v. 1.03.
       2.30  -- Corrected error in detecting different versions of PKlite;
                added detection for LEXEM; conformed code to slight
                differences required by Turbo Pascal 6.0.
       2.50  -- Added detection for SHRINK; added page-pause option; added
                ability to create text before and after redirected output.
       2.60  -- Added sorting by date/time; added Totals only mode; revised
                display of totals; added verbose mode to show file date and
                time.
       2.70  -- Added detection for EXEPACK.
       2.80  -- Added detection for EXECUTRIX; revised totals format.
       2.90  -- Added detection for WINDOWS .EXE files.
       2.95  -- Added detection for apparent overlay files.
       2.97  -- Added totals for no. of WINDOWS and overlay files.
       2.99  -- Added sorting by date OR time. 
       3.00  -- Added detection for SCRNCH; fixed minor bug in displaying
                very small ( < 100 bytes) files after running CHK4COMP
                twice in a row.
       3.05  -- Added detection for ICE.
