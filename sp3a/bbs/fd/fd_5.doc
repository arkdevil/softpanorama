                                 FOSSIL drivers


          A FOSSIL (or Fido/Opus/SEAdog Standard Interface Layer) driver is
          a memory resident program that works as a layer between the
          application program and your computer's hardware. The mailer
          requires a FOSSIL driver to function. The advantages of the
          standard FOSSIL interface is that programs can be ported easily
          to other machines and/or operating systems.

          There are several FOSSIL drivers available. The mailer has been
          tested with OpusComm, X00 and BNU with good results. X00 and BNU
          will be described here.


     B.1  BNU


          BNU, written by David Nugent, comes in two flavors. One is a
          device driver, similar to X00.SYS. The second flavor is a .COM
          file, loaded from AUTOEXEC.BAT or another batch file. I use the
          .COM flavor. For a detailed description of the BNU driver, read
          the documentation included in the BNU distribution archive.

               [AUTOEXEC.BAT]

               BNU /R=1024 /T=512 /L1:38400

               /R=1024        Specifies a transmit buffer of 1024 bytes.

               /T=512         Specifies a receive buffer of 512 bytes.

               /L1:38400      Locks COM2 at 38,400 bps (for use with the
                              14400 HST or DS modems).

               If you are not using a high-speed modem the above example
               should most likely be modified to not lock COM2.

     B.2  X00.SYS


          X00, written by Ray Gwinn, is a device driver, it's loaded from
          your CONFIG.SYS file when your machine is started. For a detailed
          description of the X00 driver, read the documentation included in
          the X00 distribution archive.

               [CONFIG.SYS]

               device = X00.SYS E 1 B,1,38400 T=512 R=1024

               E              Disable 5 second "commercial" when X00 is
                              first loaded.

               1              Number of COM ports X00 should allow to be
                              accessed at one time.

               B,1,38400      Locks COM2 at 38,400 bps (for use with the
                              14400 HST or DS modems).

               T=512          Specifies a transmit buffer of 512 bytes.

               R=1024         Specifies a receive buffer of 1024 bytes.

               If you are not using a high-speed modem the above example
               may not be what you want. The most common command line for
               X00 is:

               device    = X00.SYS E 1

                                     Modems


          FrontDoor works with several modems, including USR HST, Telebit's
          Trailblazer, ANC, Everex and Hayes. The general rule is that the
          modem must be able to send alphanumeric result strings. For most
          modems, the basic configuration is all that is required. For
          high-speed modems such as the HST, a few extra settings are
          necessary. The reason HST is the only modem described here is
          because it's the only modem I've used with FrontDoor.


     C.1  General requirements


          The modem must not echo characters sent by FrontDoor, it must not
          have CD (carrier detect) forced. It should support disconnecting
          by lowering DTR (data terminal ready), but it's not necessary.
          DTR must not be forced.

          The current version of FrontDoor does not support manually
          operated modems with fixed speeds since most of them do not send
          any type of messages to the terminal (program). This is expected
          to be implemented in future versions.

          To use FrontDoor with high-speed modems such as the HST and
          Trailblazer, it is often necessary to lock your COM port (using
          fixed speed). In general, this improves throughput. For more
          information about this, see FOSSIL drivers.

                                  Multitasking


          FrontDoor can be used together with most multitasking programs.
          It has been tested with DESQview, DoubleDOS, Multilink and
          Taskview. It will automatically detect most multitasking
          software. My personal suggestion would be DESQview. One of the
          best multitaskers around for PC/MS-DOS.


     D.1  NS16550


          If you're running FrontDoor under a multitasker or in a LAN
          environment, I suggest you replace your 8250 or 16450 UART chip
          with a NS16550AN or NS16550AFN. These are available from several
          electronics outfits for somewhere between USD 17 and USD 23.

          The 16550 family of UARTs have internal buffering and will
          improve performance in multitasking and LAN environments. Both
          BNU and X00 has direct support for the 16550 family and can be
          used without modifying your command-line paratmeters when loading
          them.

     D.2  DESQview


          FrontDoor will request a virtual screen buffer from DV and write
          to it. The result is very fast and very well behaved screen
          writes. I have successfully used FrontDoor's mailer under
          DESQview 2.21 (and 2.25) with 180KB. Here're the settings I use
          with DESQview:

     D.3  DoubleDOS


          Smart multitasking software allocates a virtual screen buffer for
          each task. Applications can then ask the multitasking software
          where it should write and the multitasker handles the screen
          updates. DoubleDOS, however, is using a different method.

          Every time you switch tasks from the keyboard, the screen-buffers
          change. So there's no easy way for the software running under
          DoubleDOS to detect this. In DoubleDOS 5.00, there are two
          options that allows you to run FrontDoor under DoubleDOS just
          fine. You MUST run FrontDoor in the TOP section for the two
          methods below to work.

          DISPLAY=TEXT        If your system has a MCGA, CGA, EGA or VGA
                              card installed, there's extra memory
                              available on those cards for graphics, etc.
                              DoubleDOS can use some of that memory for
                              each of its screen buffers. To enable this,
                              add DISPLAY=TEXT to your DDCONFIG.SYS file.

          REFRESH             If you have a text-only adapter (MDA) there's
                              most likely no extra memory available on the
                              card. Add REFRESH by itself on a line to your
                              DDCONFIG.SYS file. This will tell DoubleDOS
                              to repaint the screen if the other task is
                              bleeding through.

          X00 and DoubleDOS   When using FrontDoor, X00.SYS and DoubleDOS,
                              there are a few rules that must be followed:

                              Do not assign the COM ports in DDCONFIG.SYS

                              Make sure you execute CAPTURE (supplied with
                              X00) after you execute DOUBLEDO (the
                              DoubleDOS executable). To be safe, execute
                              CAPTURE in both partitions.

                              If you have problems with your clock, try the
                              DEFER option in X00.

                              Make sure you replace ANSI.SYS with
                              DBLDANSI.SYS.

                              The BOTTOM partition should initialize before
                              the TOP partition. In other words, if you're
                              loading FrontDoor in the BOTTOM partition,
                              try to delay the initialization of the TOP
                              partition.

     D.4  Multilink


          I would personally not recommend anyone using FrontDoor with
          Multilink. I have never successfully executed any program under
          Multilink for longer periods of time than momentarily.

                       Converting from other mail systems


          If you were using SEAdog or D'Bridge before you started using
          FrontDoor, you should have little trouble converting to
          FrontDoor. The routing and message handling used by these two
          mail systems is very similar to the way things are done with
          FrontDoor.

          If you are converting from Binkley, Opus, or Dutchie, however,
          there are a few things you should know and make sure you have
          done before you install FrontDoor.

          The main difference between FrontDoor and Binkley or Opus is that
          FrontDoor doesn't use oMMM, the static message packer written by
          Bob Hartman. We see the oMMM approach as a black hole from which
          there's no return. This is not true in some cases and there are
          advantages of using oMMM type packers instead of the method used
          by FrontDoor.

          oMMM will create what we call static bundles, where each system
          has a control file that tells the mailer what files and messages
          to send to what systems. FrontDoor will NOT recognize oMMM type
          bundles (packets) so before you fully convert to FrontDoor, you
          must make sure that all the oMMM type mail is sent before you
          convert to FrontDoor.

          You can use FrontDoor to send the remaining oMMM type mail by
          attaching the files manually with FrontDoor's editor or a robot
          utility such as XRobot, but you'll need a utility with which you
          can determine which file belongs to which system before you can
          do this. So it might be easier for you to tell Binkley or Opus to
          send its remaining mail before you do the conversion.
