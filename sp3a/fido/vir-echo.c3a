The bad code in ANSI bombs is executed when the bomb text file is typed. The
ANSI driver monitors the output to the console and *executes* the ANSI sequences
it finds, with all their bad commands (keyboard reprogramming). If the ANSI
driver, which executes the sequences, is NOT present in memory, an ANSI bomb
will not work. ANSI bombs do not go through holes in PKUNZIP, but are really
executed, though in another way than normal COM/EXE programs.

 Subj : Rename dangerous DOS commands                                           
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Your idea to rename dangerous DOS commands as a protection against those simple
ANSI trojans looks very good. But after you have renamed all external dangerous
commands, there are still some internal ones left which may be dangerous (DEL,
ERASE, etc.). To prevent unauthorized access to these commands by ANSI trojans,
you can patch the names of these commands in your COMMAND.COM file to another
name or, even better, numbers (for example, DEL becomes 406, ERASE becomes
29500). An ANSI trojan then has no chance to get access to these commands unless
it knows the new names, and so the protection is even better.

I don't think so... the versions I've seen (admittedly older ones) only seem to
make a copy on the disk itself.  If the master boot and partition record is
scrogged, it would have no way of finding the partition containing the saved
copy of the data, so it couldn't put it back.  It would have to be saved
somewhere else (e.g. on a floppy disk) and would have to be able to be written
back to a DOS-inaccessible disk volume.

Bypassing MS-DOS level write protection on a file is trivial:  you just change
the file status to read/write.  (You don't even have to write a program:  just
"shell out" to ATTRIB!  (If you're running on a Novell system, you MUST have
suitable authority in order to do this).  But you CANNOT bypass the write
protection on a diskette which is set by a write protect tab.

    Sorry about that. It simply amounts to a slang phrase (it is what North
American English is full of). When I say how much weight does somebody carry I
mean how much influence do they have. So if I may rephrase the sentence... How
much influence does the Dark Avenger have in Bulgaria (make sense? :-).

    So he is a wanted person in Bulgaria...You said Bulgaria "was without laws"
(paraphasing)... What will they charge him with...Public mischief? I imagine
even if they do catch this gut nothjing bad will happen to him. If I may make a
small suggestion...Why doesn't he just "disappear" in the night. To quote a
Soviet General "It's a large country, 1 person won't be missed." :-).
    But it looks like Dark Avenger's activities have not gone unnoticed.

    So from what you've told me he's trying not to make himself that known so
people don't track him down. Now it almost sounds like he's playing with fire
and trying to see how much he can get away with.

    That must have interesting. I can imagine that both of them would have been
surprised. Would have been interested to see the look on both their faces :-).

    Is Vesselin losing interest in his "friend" or is the whole mess dragging on
and Vesselin is giving up on the hope of catching him?

    Did you have to go through any red tape to set up your BBS? How hard can it
be to set up a BBS in Bulgaria? I know at least here in Canada at least you can
do it with no hassles form the authorities. What battles did you have to go
through and why would the authorities be interested in your BBS?

    It is a rather old situation. You have a friend who has never did anything
bad to you but he killed a man. Do you turn him in? Similarily if I knew a guy
who wrote a virus I would turn him in. But I suppose both our outlooks on life
may be different since we were brought up under two different systems.

    The authorities in Bulgaria wouldn't use the logs for other purposes would
they :-)? I find it the differences in our two countries till you actually talk
to somebody who lives there. For the most part if you went to the police here
all you would really have to do is present the information required. You don't
have to give them everything. If you really want I know where I live you can
make anonomous phone calls to the police and give tips to the police.

    In your own opinion is Vesselin doing this because its the "right thing to
do" or is he doing it to make himself look good in front of the AV community? As
for the Dark Avenger we could have uncovered a new moitive for writing
viruses...virus writing motivated by love :-). Girls are supposed to go for guys
who write viruses <grin>.
    Who is this girl? Vesselin's wife :-).

    How reliable are Vesselin's programs to begin with? I've never seen one up
here so I'd have to ask somebody who has seen one. I imagine it would be safe to
assume this is a smear tatic the DA is trying to use to discredit Vesselin.

    I found it odd also so once I saw you were here and you were from Bulgaria I
decided I might as well ask somebody who knows something about Bulgaria instead
of taking other people's word for it. But even half a world away their little
war hasn't gone unnoticed.
    Just another little question...Are there such things as virus distribution
BBSs in Bulgaria? I've heard about their possible existance but don't know if
they actually do exist.
    Also in your user logs is Dark Avenger entered as Dark Avenger or did he use
another name (don't have to name the name) and did he leave a call back number?
Be interested to know how far he does go to protect his identity.

    Its a crying shame too...Think about all the time wasted writing viruses and
trying to stop them. But I suppose we need them or else people like Dark Avenger
or John Mcafee would be out of a job :-).

    Practically everything I try which I suspect may do "strange" things I try
out on a PCjr (at least now we know what the PCjr is good for :-). I mainly use
the PCjr for the execution of viruses, CPAV or any PD utilities that are too
good to be true <grin>.

 >Does anyone have any info on this virus.

Virus Name:  Manta
Aliases:
Scan ID:     [Mant]
V Status:    Rare
Discovered:  July, 1991
Symptoms:    .COM file growth; AUTOEXEC.BAT & CONFIG.SYS replaced;
             programs fail to execute properly
Origin:      Unknown
Eff Length:  1,077 Bytes
Type Code:   PNCK - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
Detection Method:  ViruScan V82+
Removal Instructions:  Scan/D, or delete infected files

General Comments:
      The Manta virus was received in July, 1991.  Its origin is unknown.
      Manta is a non-resident direct action infector of .COM files,
      including COMMAND.COM.  Manta is based on the VCS virus.

      When a program infected with Manta is executed, up to four .COM
      files in the current directory may be infected by the Manta virus.
      Additionally, the following message may be displayed, and the
AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files on drive C: may be replaced:

        "RAM Parity Error @ 0F67:1B2C
         (C)ontinue  (S)hut off NMI  (R)eboot

If C is entered for "Continue", the program will then most likely
function properly.

A blank entry may also be created in the current directory for a
512 byte file, though this does not always occur.

Programs infected with the Manta virus will increase in size by
1,077 bytes, the virus will be located at the end of the infected
file.

The 512 byte file which replaced AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS on
drive C: willl contain the above message, and several lines of
text in German.

BC>(again, I'm not referring to you, at least you had the guts to post real

BC>when we think that people ask us stuff just to hear themselves talk, and then
BC>ignore the answer that we give. . There's nothing at all wrong with you not

Joe-
so you are saying then that merely subscribing to this 'horrid' virus digest
makes one ineligible to peruse your program? you certainly have that right, but
isnt that a bit of elitism? the more information one has the more clearly they
think on a given topic; so, would not a person who was clearly and -totally-
informed be able to make better decision regarding your program?

Heheh Brian, you're a regular riot.  Try Norton Utilities,
PC-Tools, or you can get another copy of that UNHIDE.COM
from PC Magazine' BBS.  I would recommend ATTR.COM from
PC-Mag instead though.  (UNHIDE.COM won't accept wildcards
to unhide the files, and I doubt you remember the names of
each of the files you've hidden, do you?)

Yes, you're right about the shadow RAM, but I did say
*and mean* ROM, above.  You will have to turn off the
shadow RAM feature temporarily to find the real ROM
address, as you install the software.  Then you can
re-enable the shadowing.

 MG> me, this would be a very strong argument in favour of that

Well, yes and no.  I do know of several public-domain
change-checking programs that use the original ROM vectors
to find bootsector/MBR-PT viruses, but not file viruses.
Reason: it is more work to write a file-checking program
that is compatible with most versions of DOS, that can
examine *files* without using DOS routines.  Sector-by-
sector file-handling is entirely possible, but certainly
more difficult.  That is the reason there are no public-
domain scanners available to do that yet.  It is an
ambitious project, that will certainly need a lot of
technical support in the beginning, as the oddities of
peculiar DOS versions are not guaranteed to play fairly.

No. Post it in this echo, no matter how long (I guess it will be only some lines
long since it must go REALLY deep inside the system architecture, so it can't be
much longer than a few lines :-) ).

Otherwise, if you don't dare to do this (in order to not being blamed by too
many people of supplying bad information), post it to the address in the origin
line below. You can do so with anyone demanding the file.

And tell me what the PROBAS lib is, I dunno, as I'm not an advanced basic user.
If you are allowed, post it, too.


I will compile this as well as it works and use the result on an original disk
from some program. After that, I`ll compare the treated disk to the backup disk.
If there's ANYTHING different, I'll post you my disk drive and buy one which
really resists such nonsense. It is, for sure, a bad one, then.

Theoretically speaking, you can "remote-control" the system of any downloader of
this file in that way. But this is actually nothing but another trojan.

Well, there may be the chance of puttin a redefinition sequence inside a header
of a ZIP file. You'll extract the zip, and if you hit the right key next, e.g.
the "d" for dir, it may automatically start an extracted executable from the
zip. If this one contains a virus, you will have got one of the meanest droppers
one can think of.

Maybe that's the thing people are rumouring around here and no one wanna say too
much about? I think the most simple way is to load an escapesequence filter like
Pksfansi.

Let's express the question more clearly: Is it possible to make any extractor
execute any code of an archive just by extracting it? I think no, if there was
no dirty stuff loaded before, or the extractor is not tampered with.

This is why I want to get a test of the PKSFANSI filter. Does it work ? Does it
not ? Why can't anyone construct a "redefinition preventer", if it doesn't ?
Which ANSI drivers support the /K switch ? How can I get 'em ?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Hi everybody!

I got the file RAMBIOS.SYS from a BBS. It is intended to accelerate the VGA-
Screen-output by using it as a device-driver. I had already such a program so I
looked in it (TYPE or so...) in order to find a version number.
But instead I found the following text between the code:

"Disk Killer -- Version 1.00 by COMPUTER OGRE 04/01/1989
Warning !!
Don't turn off the power or remove the diskette while Disk Killer is Processing!
PROCESSING
Now you can turn off the power.
I wish you luck !"

Does anybody know wheather this is a virus (or kind of that stuff...) or not?
Maybe it's just a April's Joke (look at the release date) but it is definetly
NOT a VGA-driver!! Has anybody made any experience with that THING???
SCANV84 doesn't recognize it as a virus.

Hope to get answer.

    Carsten Finis

 Virus Name: Exterminator 2.0

       Type: Direct Action, Overwriting .COM Infector

Eff. Length: 429 bytes

Comments:

  This virus is very much like the previous viruses in this family
  (Exterminator 1.0, Badguy, Demon) except for the length and the
  text contained within the virus:

  "Exterminator 2.0 - (c) by Cracker Jack 1991 (IVRL)"
  "Italian Virus Research Laboratory"
  "(C) 1990,1991"
  "Meassage to Virus Researchers: Vedo che non avete sequito
   il mio consiglio!!"
  "Adesso mi sono arrabbiato.........."
  "Virix-Researchers Exterminator 2.0 (c) by Cracker Jack"

  [Translation welcome.]

  As the virus code is 429 bytes, any file smaller than 429 bytes
  will have a resultant file size of 429 bytes. Files > 429 bytes
  will be overwritten at the end of the file. As with the other
  viruses in this family, it's activation date is on Mondays, at
  which time if it is activated, it will overwrite the first 160
  sectors of the C: drive.

  Utilities that detect the other viruses in the family should detect
  this one as well (ie SCANv84 detects it as [I-B] and HTScan v1.16
  detects it as Badguy-related)...

No need.
You may either use VCOPY to copy the files or load VSHIELD V82 and above.
Both ways will scan the copied files during the copy operation.

The following message was sent to me by Mr Zvi Netiv, author of V-Care
anti-virus package.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                        October 26, 1991

    From: Zvi Netiv, author V-Care/V-Guard.
    To: Nemrod Kedem, Rudy's Place BBS Sysop.
    Subject: Virus DIR-2 and related.

    Referring to McAfee's info release from 27 Sept 91, warning from
    virus DIR-2, fast sweeping across Europe.
    The bad news are that its "preview" is already sweeping Israel, under
    the form of virus 1963. The good news are that the family of FAT
    deception viruses are within V-Care's scope of generic techniques and
    are eradicated by VSCAN.
    The mechanism described by McAfee, concerning DIR-2, is used by 1963
    in precisely the same way. It uses super stealth (file length is kept
    the same, even when the virus is not in memory), it uses FAT
    deception, will destroy all infected executables when using CHKDSK/F
    etc.
    The detection and eradication methods against these viruses will be
    presented next month in a seminar I give in Paris and at the NCSA /
    AVPD conference convening in Washington DC at the end of November.

Hope you'll fine this information useful.

By VALID Values what do you mean? If they are correct VALID values, the system
will boot fine, invalid values is what the argument was over? If you mean valid
as in "logical" yet conflicting, on *MY* system, it will still recognize this. I

I think if anybody managed to design an OS that can not be attacked by anything
(also system crashes), we would all be more than grateful. Seems to me that
protected mode & stuff like that would bring us much closer to this. I don't
have any experiences with writing software under OS/2, but IS it possible to
directly modify, say, the system kernel without creating some sort of procted
mode violation?

An operating system in which every program runs an separate virtual machine
without having access to any memory other than the one it has allocated would
certainly make life harder for virus writers. But it would also make life harder
for those writing system utilities (like me). No more little TSRs intercepting
interrupts and doing neat things...

So it's all a tradeoff between flexibility and vulnerability.

Yes, well the old Apple II Disc drives had all the guts ripped out of
them by Apple Corp. who decided that doing all the stuff in the
machine's master CPU would be a neat idea.

They were wrong.

Anyway, you don't hear of many Apple 2 viruses, do you? Nor CP/M
viruses. (I guess they must exist..)

I believe some early 1541 Commodore 64 disc drives were also like this.
You don't hear of many Commodore 64 viruses, do you?

I think when I speak of viruses and the whole subject of writing to
write-protected discs in general, we're all talking about PCs, STs, and
Commodore Amigas.

I must disagree with you here. A mail bomb is _anything_ sent to a BBS disguised
as mail, but intended to disrupt BBS services.

I know e.g. of a trick to make a BBS hang until the sysop comes around to reboot
his computer, but it's not done by filling up the hard disk. ;-)

It also means that an ANSI-'bomb' could also be a mail bomb, if carefully
prepared for the purpose.

So I guess we should categorise mail bombs as trojans and consider them off
topic in this echo...

Sure. But a central idea about mail bombs is that they are intended to be
'detonated' by a mail system, i.e. conceptually a system _without_ human
operator. That's why they're disguised as mail, mail is 'automatically' unpacked
and tossed.

Consider you may be out of town for the week, and your system receives a mail
bomb the moment you get out of the door. ;-)

 The person who calls himself Dark Avenger - the author of the "Eddie"
 virus (and others), has just released a "mutation engine" - a skeleton
 for constructing encrypted self-modifying viruses.  This program has
 been posted in source code form on several virus BBSes, and although
 it is not as sohisticated as expected, I would not be surprised if
 several viruses build around it would apper in the next few months.

Do you have an AT ? If so, this is normal. If not, it could be a simple boot
infector like the Alameda virus.

1963? Well, I always thought it was based on the number Of The Beast, I bet it
is using the same techniques. But it is still unapparent to me how the virus
would try to fix .EXE files at load time, or does it restrict itself only to
.EXE files smaller than 64K?
BTW Evil is also from DA, did you know it trashes harddisks after the virus is
gone ? (I found out the hard way....long live backups!)

A few weeks ago, someone raised the question whether there were viruses written
by females. Well, I analysed my collection and found one suitable virus: Oropax.
Why ?
- nondamaging and funny
- virus is actually very friendly, it doesn't even infect when you execute a
file, only when things are written to disk
- no-problem coding
Well, what do you think? Do you know if there actually is a virus written by a
female? Or don't women interest in this kinda thing, just like with chess ?

Howdy, everybody.  I have a bunch of information about various computer security
topics, some of which are not related to viruses.  I'm merely throwing these
topics out, in case any of you feel that these things are of interest to you and
not too far off topic.  They are: (1) The hardware design methodology for a disk
subsystem that can, in hardware, write-protect specific files and their
directory entries, thus virtually eliminating viruses. (2) Crytography - I have
anything you want relating to the Data Encryption Standard (DES - FIPS Pub 46),
and holocryptic one-time systems using advanced helical scan tape or optical
disk for keying data.  I wrote a demo DES program in Turbo Pascal if anyone
cares. (3) EMI evesdropping, sometimes called Van Eck phreaking, where a passive
radio receiver and some PLL circuitry can monitor what's on your CRT from 1/4
mile away.  I have information on US Govt countermeasures, often referred to as
NACSIM 5100A, or Tempest. (4) High-tech airport security. (5) Electronic banking
fraud, and other data relating to the US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1987.
Electronic teller machine fraud, also. (6) Certain types of secure voice
systems. (7) US Gov't policy towards COMPUSEC, and in particular, the
relationship between National Security Agency, National Computer Security
Center, and National Institute of Standards and Technology.
............................................... So, if anyone is interested in
discussing these topics, sound off.  By the way, I heard some good AV advice the
other day: "Don't run software obtained from anyone you wouldn't want your
sister to have unsafe sex with!"    Later, dudes.   Gary

you think there should be no online games? <gasp>. well, im interested to hear

(who was talking about SEAS and mailbombs). yes, keep your bbs virus free...and
dont let em jump to dos...

seriously, besides the scan routines and never publishing 'you cant catch it
here', how much more responsible can one get? -and- how responsible is one
anyway? is this a community problem, an individual responsiblity?? or (god
forbid) the responsibility of-someone else-
???

what do you mean 'maybe these are elastic clauses'. im sure its something like
reading between the rows, but im a bit lost. (whats new). ok. well, you say that
it is a crime if the virus does damage. not necessarily. crime is defined by
legal stand, and in absense of such we must ask ourselves if the action and
resultant is criminal in nature.

is it criminal to show someone their system is not secured? how much more
criminal to allow them to think all it well until the day peoplea are -really-
damaged by their egotisitcal insistence that they run the superior ship. we have
all seen here,even , how the best among you are vulnerable. if someone can slip
a nazi hate boostagogo thingy past Bamestra or InfoDesk, why not slip something
more next time..and more and more...its all just preliminary games.

so the issue remains, is it criminal then to put in viruses that merely make
eventual access of the desired information available? i say it is -not-.


i would agree however, that if a virus causes death or similar castastrophe, or
is used for blackmail, then of course it is criminal..but real virus writers
dont write things that just format your hard drive, you know. so, no criminals.

why does it seem every msg. i address today is to you? anyway, you mention that

(sic).

did it occur to you that the same fever that drives them is what drives you, me

Gerry,
  Viruses can be activated ONLY by executing thier source (.EXE, .COM, etc) any
code that is loaded directly into memory and executed can give you a virus.
(FAT + boot sector viruses don't require you to run an infected program after
you already have them)  .GIF files cannot contain viruses because they are, in
essence, data files, not program files.  Viruses cannot be contracted by
copying, unzipping, or scanning infected files.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
After cleaning a diskette infected with the STONED virus with
McAffee's clean-up program there will sometimes be 2 other problems with the
disk which I have found a way to overcome:
1.  The directory command will not display all of the files -
   I have found that this problem can be solved by going into
   Norton Utilities, which will display the complete directory
   listing.  From there, I choose each file and write them in
   file mode to the Hard Drive.  Most files will still be intact.
  Norton's Disk Doctor and Mace's Emergency Rm do not always keep
  original file names and sometimes do not recover fragmented files.
2.  When a diskette is infected with the STONED virus, there will
    be a file name of E3.3DOS (or something similar ..the E is a     ASCII
EPSILON CHARACTOR).  This occurs, because the virus writes
    the boot sector to the directory listing.  This can be removed
    in DOS by using wild cards i.e. del A:?3?3*.*.  Of course
    it is also possible to copy the files to the HD and reformat the
    floppy and copy the files back.
I hope the above information was helpful in recovering diskettes infected with
the virus.

You're right on this point, this guy has already uploaded the sources of DIR-II
and demon in an e-mail area (he uploaded them under the name Skin Head), but
then again it's really best if we just ignore this guy and try to stop his
messages, this has probably helped before as he continually changes "his" names
e.g. Long John Silver, Floda Reltih, Big D*** and so on...

Well I've once heard that Vesselin even had a meeting with Dark Avenger himself,
at that time it was a 24 year old guy with long hair, I'm, however, curious how
he arranged the meeting with him.
I don't think that Vesselin can do anything when he gets his hands on him
because it's not illegal in Bulgaria to write viruses so I think that Vesselin
will just try to convince the guy that he'd better use his "talents" for
something that's a little more responsible...

Yep, it should be fish-6, I wonder what ever happened to fish 1,2,3,4,5,7 & 8
perhaps there's even going to be a fish 10, who knows...:-)
Did you already find out when the whale writes a mutant?
Perhaps that's what the author meant with the sentence the "sixth fish mutates
only if the whale is in her cave" so each sixth whale infection will be a
mutant, perhaps I'm going to do some tests on this, if I do I'll post the
results to you later.

What you need to do is track down a copy of vsum; the file is called something
like VSUMX110.ZIP, it's really great, almost all known viruses (MS-DOS only of

This is rubbish, John won't harass anyone if he hasn't got a (good) reason for
it, just telling what you know about some viruses is not one of these good
reasons, in fact this is why this area exists, John was probably referring to
your offering of viruses via this area, this is against the conference rules,
just take it to netmail and you won't see any of these messages coming from John
again (that is, if you don't violate other rules too)...

Some do, some don't, the older scanners used HEX strings to find these viruses,
this won't, however, work on self encrypting viruses, you need some sort of
algorithmic approach to detect these ones...

Yes, but you'd have to change pretty much of the code because all scanners
search for a different pattern in files to prevent false alarms on other
scanners.

From the new remarks i added to the code you can see that that piece
 of code only overcome the READ ONLY of a file status atrribute :-)

To the subject question - this code can NOT overcome a write protect
 But maybe another piece of art can :-X  we can never know :-(

I have tried it but when i rebooted from a it does not detect the
virus . It is only when the program is installed and memory resident that scan
does pick it up . If I then run clean it just say that I must reboot from a
clean disk but does not remove the virus .

Hmmm, if you mean lock-up *their* computer from mine, that is
not what I meant earlier.  I was freezing-up *my* computer so
that they had to drop carrier.  But after a little thought on
the subject, I'm convinced that you could also lock-up their
terminal as well.  It's not as easy though, and probably not
even terribly reliable between communications packages.  But
I'm sure at some point in time you might have had some line-
noise freeze your computer, or cause you to have to reboot.
That's proof enough that your computer is to some degree,
affected by scrambled data coming *in* through the modem.

Or maybe, someone in his family made that money.  Or
maybe he holds a government job, and doesn't 'own' a
computer at all.  Regardless, it is quite apparent
that Dav has spent countless hours studying the
undocumented features of DOS, in hopes of bypassing
the obvious attempts to stop his viruses.

I think Dav is slowing down on the virus-writing these
days though.  Does that mean he's too busy with real
adult concerns nowadays?  The last thing that I
remember him writing was 'The Mutation Engine.'

      Sounds like ya need to change yer GSZ BAT file-it (GSZ) WILL send
      files to a floppy-I have done this when between hard drives.

      Nope-if you unzip (or whatever) to A, then the file'z go to A.  If
      you unzip onto C and then copy, then a hidden/ro could stay on C:,
      but unless you execute it, no problem.

GG>   Or could the virus stay behind as a hidden file on C: ?

      Most people don't know it, but a GIF IS compressed, using the same
      algorithm variation as LHARC and LHA, but the key to remember is that
      a GIF is NOT executable, and no virus could vector out of it unaided.
      Also, a "move" command in straight DOS won't work across drives, so I
      assume you are using a drop in replacement, or a shell like Elftree.
      Both of these do a copy and delete instead of a true move, which is
      actually a rename of the file in disguise.  In any case, a hidden file
      will also do nothing, unless it is somehow executed.
      Finally, if you are getting tired of all this shuffle, you can call
      Sysop's Haven or Open Door or Wicked Sensations over in Pittsburgh,
      and download a file called ACxx.ZIP (xx is the version number), which
      will automate this process for ya, and even check your GIF files and
      make a log file of their resolutions.  Works on all major archive
      formats, and uses SCAN.  Lemme know what ya think of it....

I don't support ANSI except when I'm calling out. No reason for pretty colors on
my end and the codes get sent out properly for the menus anyway.... The other
thing I do is rename all the important files on my system, hide them, or
otherwise make them difficult to find for people unfamiliar with the system. I
saw other people getting hit, got paranoid, and never got hurt myself....!

just try MacAffee's CLEAN [MICH]  (CLEAN version >= 82). It successfully cleaned
my part.table. Did you localize the disk you got MICH from?
Seems to be creeping around on several sealed disks.

Absolutely horror !
Using DEBUG allows you to **low-level**format a harddisk...........
No need to assemble a virus. But absolutely possible ! You can assemble whatever
you want, if you are pressing the '\'-key for instance.

Call my BBS (yes, quite new and with some bugs sometimes...).
I've written a patch for ANSI.SYS (original ANSI) for DOS 3.00 till 5.00.

It DISables keyboard-reprogramming.
It gives you the option to restore ANSI to allow it again.

The most important things are those you don't know, huh? Which goes for me also,
I'm sure. ;-)

The thing I don't know now is, what exactly is it you want explained? Mail bombs
come in various forms (I think I only know a fraction of it...).

Bet you will. ;-)

Mail bombs are different in that the criterium to get them that name is that
they are intended to be "processed" by the email software that e.g. Fido bbs's
run.

ANSI bombs are called that way because they intentionally exploit weaknesses of
the ANSI driver (keyboard remapping). A mail bomb could be implemented as an
ANSI bomb. So the two are really different things. ;-)

UC?

Hello all you virus-experts in various contries out there !

I am a student at law, and I am also very much interested in computers and
everything that is related to them. Therefore (and also because I suffered from
one of them) I am interested in computer virusses.

My finishing paper I therefore would like to write about the relationship
between virusses and law: how can virusses (or more accurate, virus-authors) be
legally stopped and punished. I know this is a delicate and new subject, but if
you know something about how the legal situation is concerning computer virusses
in your country, please let me know. Please tell me whether it is possible to
prosecute a virus-author and in how far civil-law actions can be taken against
the author.

I thank you in advance,                         << Gert >>
