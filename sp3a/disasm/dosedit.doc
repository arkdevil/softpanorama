DOSEDIT is a simple editor for DOS commands.  It can be used with DOS
1.1 and DOS 2.x.  DOSEDIT uses a special set of the keys on the IBM PC
keyboard to allow you to edit the DOS command you are entering or one
of the previous commands that you have entered.  It keeps a command
stack of the last 256 characters of commands that you have entered and
you can scroll back and forth through this stack.  It also allows you
to edit the current command being displayed.  NOTE:  1 or 2 character
commands are not saved.

UP arrow         Scrolls backward through the command stack.
DOWN arrow       Scrolls forward through the command stack.
ESC              Clears the command line.
LEFT arrow       Moves the cursor left one position.
RIGHT arrow      Moves the cursor right one position.
HOME             Moves the cursor to the beginning of the command line.
END              Moves the cursor to the end of the command line.
INS              Toggles the insert function.
DEL              Deletes the character under the cursor.
CTRL-left arrow  Moves the cursor left a word at a time.
CTRL-right arrow Moves the cursor right a word at a time.
CTRL-HOME        Erases from the beginning of the line to the cursor.
CTRL-END         Erases from the cursor to the end of the line.
CTRL-PGUP        Erases the command stack.
CTRL-PGDN        Erases the displayed entry from the command stack.
BACKSPACE        Remains unchanged.
CTRL-Z           Puts in an End-of-File (1AH - replaces the F6 key).

The function keys F1-F6 no longer have assigned functions.

Tutorial:

After power on, or <Alt><Ctrl><Del>, from the DOS prompt, enter
DOSEDIT (One time).  No message will be returned, only the DOS prompt.
To experiment with DOSEDIT, from the DOS prompt enter:

        A> ECHO ONE
        A> ECHO TWO
        A> ECHO THREE

Now use the up arrow key to see the last command (ECHO THREE).  Again
use the up arrow key to see the preceding command (ECHO TWO).  Now
press enter to execute that command.  Then press the down arrow key to
see the following command (ECHO THREE).  Press either the up or down
arrow key several times to see how the commands wrap around.  Use the
Esc key to clear the command line.  Enter new commands and use the
control keys defined above to become familiar with all the functions.
