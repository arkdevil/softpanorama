              | OpenDoc Part Development Questionnaire |        quesodoc
              +----------------------------------------+

The following is a note from a member of the OpenDoc testing group in
IBM Boca Raton, followed by a questionnaire.

Hello OpenDoc Developers!

As a representative of the OpenDoc testing organization in Boca Raton, I
would like to extend an offer to all of you to help improve the test
effort associated with the OpenDoc product.

It is our objective over the coming months to introduce as many customer
scenarios and parts into our testing methodology as possible. This is
where you can be of invaluable service to us and ultimately to OpenDoc.
We would like to establish an ongoing relationship with you and your
area where we can include your current part(s) (and those you develop
later) within our test buckets. As a testing organization, we will not
be packaging or releasing this information in any manner. It is our
intention to simply use the part within the context that you have
developed it for, in hopes of replicating a future customer scenario. In
return, we would be happy to return comments and suggestions to those of
you looking for feedback.

Following this note is a file that contains a brief questionnaire. We
would appreciate your taking a few moments to complete the softcopy form
and return it to my userid, given below. I will then roll up a summary
of the files returned, and provide this information to all of you. This
information could prove beneficial to those of you looking to possibly
port new function versus having to write new code.

We understand that some of your parts are currently in the prototype
stage, or are maybe just designs at this point. We would still like to
hear as much detail as you have available. The goal here would be to
identify the function that your part will be providing. Also, if your
part is blocked from completion due to an outside influence, please list
those dependencies.

In closing, let me say again how important this aspect of our testing
will be, and we are relying on the information returned from you to
assist us in this effort. Thanks in advance for your help.

                       +----------------+

Here are several tips for OS/2 Warp Version 3.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

               +-----------------------------------+
               |  How to Install the OS/2 Warp CD  |              wcd525
               | Starting from 5.25-Inch Diskettes |
               +-----------------------------------+

The CD version of OS/2 Warp comes with two 3.5-inch diskettes that must
be used in the A: drive to start the installation. To install the CD
version from a 5.25-inch A: drive, two 1.2 MB, 5.25-inch diskettes must
be created. The process for creating them is given below.

Notes:

(1) Please read the entire procedure so that you understand it fully
    before beginning its steps.

(2) You will need two 1.2 MB, 5.25-inch diskettes for this procedure.
    Label one "OS/2 Warp 525 CD Disk 0" and the other "OS/2 Warp 525 CD
    Disk 1".

(3) If you intend to use Advanced Install, do NOT choose to format your
    hard disk as HPFS.

Procedure:

 1. Start the system from DOS.

 2. Insert the 525 CD Disk 1 into drive A. From the C:\> prompt, type:
      FORMAT A: /U
    and press Enter.

 3. When prompted for the volume label, type:
      DISK 1
    and press Enter.

 4. From the C:\> prompt, type (pressing Enter after each entry):
      MD CDINST
      CD CDINST
      MD DISK0
      MD DISK1
      CD DISK1

 5. Insert the 3.5-inch OS/2 Warp Disk 1 into drive B. Type (pressing
    Enter after each entry):
      COPY B:\*.*

      DEL PRINT02.SYS
      DEL SCREEN02.SYS
      DEL TEDIT.*
      DEL PRINT01.SYS
      DEL HPFS.IFS

 6. Insert the 3.5-inch OS/2 Warp Installation diskette in drive B.
    Type:
      COPY B:\LMS205.ADD
    and press Enter.

 7. Using an editor, edit C:\CDINST\DISK1\CONFIG.SYS. Add the word REM
    (followed by a blank space) before each of the following lines:
      IFS=HPFS.IFS /C:64
      BASEDEV=PRINT01.SYS
      BASEDEV=IBM2FLPY.ADD
      BASEDEV=IBM2ADSK.ADD
      BASEDEV=IBM2SCSI.ADD

 8. Below the line BASEDEV=LMS206.ADD, add the line:
      BASEDEV=LMS205.ADD

 9. Save the edited file and exit the editor.

10. Copy the entire C:\CDINST\DISK1 directory to the OS/2 Warp 525 CD
    Disk 1 in the A: drive. To do this (keeping in mind that you are
    currently in the C:\CDINST\DISK1 directory), type:
      COPY *.* A:\
    and press Enter.

11. Insert the OS/2 Warp 525 CD Disk 0 in drive A. From the C:\> prompt,
    type:
      FORMAT A: /U
    and press Enter. When prompted for the volume label, type:
      DISK 0
    and press Enter.

12. Type (pressing Enter after each entry):
      CD..
      CD DISK0
      COPY B:\*.*
      DEL BUNDLE

13. Type:
      DEBUG
    and press Enter.

14. From the - prompt, type (pressing Enter after each entry):
      L DS:0 1 0 1
      E 13 60
      E 14 09
      E 15 F9
      E 16 07
      E 18 0F
      W DS:0 0 0 1
      Q

      COPY *.* A:\

15. Remove the 3.5-inch OS/2 Warp Installation diskette from drive B,
    and reboot the system to begin the installation from drive A.

16. When prompted to insert DISK 1, insert your OS/2 Warp 525 CD Disk 1,
    and follow the prompts.

17. Select Easy or Advanced Installation.

     |   How to Install OS/2 Warp and OS/2 2.1 for Windows on   |  wapre
     | IBM Aptiva Computers that are Preloaded with DOS/Windows |
     +----------------------------------------------------------+

During the installation of either OS/2 Warp or OS/2 2.1 for Windows, the
user is prompted for Microsoft Windows diskettes. But IBM Aptiva
computers that come preloaded with DOS/Windows have no diskettes with
which to finish the installation process; therefore, the WIN-OS/2
component cannot be installed.

Three files used during installation of Windows provide the information
necessary to properly install and maintain the Windows platform. The key
file that Windows Setup uses to install the Windows system and its
application files is SETUP.INF (the other two are CONTROL.INF and
APPS.INF).

To enable installation of the WIN-OS/2 component, you must edit the file
SETUP.INF before you install OS/2 Warp or OS/2 2.1 for Windows.
SETUP.INF has 13 sections, one of which -- the .Disks. section -- needs
to be edited. This section describes the disks that may be requested
during installation, and their characteristics.

In the .Disks. section, the following statements appear:

  1 =. ,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #1",disk1
  2 =. ,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #2",disk2
  3 =. ,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #3",disk3
  4 =. ,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #4",disk4
  5 =. ,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #5",disk5
  6 =. ,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #6",disk6

Edit these statements so that they become:

  1 =X:\windows\drivers,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #1",disk1
  2 =X:\windows\drivers,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #2",disk2
  3 =X:\windows\drivers,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #3",disk3
  4 =X:\windows\drivers,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #4",disk4
  5 =X:\windows\drivers,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #5",disk5
  6 =X:\windows\drivers,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #6",disk6

where X = the drive where Windows is installed.

Although this change should be made before installing OS/2 Warp or OS/2
2.1 for Windows, it can be made after installation by using the
Selective Install feature.

              | How to Remove Multimedia in OS/2 Warp |           wremmm
              +---------------------------------------+

This procedure is for users who need to remove OS/2 Warp multimedia from
their computer if a wrong sound card is selected or the initial
installation did not complete properly.

Steps for removing multimedia:

1. Delete the Multimedia folder and all other folders that were created
   or shadowed.

2. Make a copy of your OS/2 CONFIG.SYS file for backup.

3. Edit the OS/2 CONFIG.SYS file as follows:

   a. Find and remove all instances of MMOS2 in the CONFIG.SYS.
      You should find instances of MMOS2 in the following locations:
      - Path
      - Dpath
      - Libpath
      - Bookshelf
      - Help

   b. Remove all MMOS2 device-driver statements.

   c. Remove the statement SET NCDEBUG=4000

4. Save and exit. Shutdown and reboot.

5. Open up the Drives folder, and double-click on the drive letter where
   multimedia is installed.

6. Locate the MMOS2 folder and delete it.

Multimedia is now removed from the system.

Users who subsequently wish to reinstall Multimedia should run Selective
Install.

migration of DAP services to Internet. Later in 1995, IBM will provide
question-and-answer forums for developers, as is currently done via the
EMEA OS/2 DAP bulletin-board system. The Q&A forums will be accessible
only by registered members of the EMEA OS/2 Developer Assistance
Program. In the meantime, the bulletin-board system will continue to
run.

PSM EMEA Web Server
-------------------

The new DAP presence is  apart of the IBM Personal Software Marketing
EMEA World Wide Web server.  The DAP home page can be located in the
Programmes and Services section on the PSM EMEA server's home page.
Also in this section you can find details about an extensive library
of device drivers available via FTP.

Selecting a Category
--------------------

There are two ways to select a category:

A. If your e-mail facility allows you to forward/resend the e-mail
   that contains the category form, place a "S" (for select) to the
   left of the category description. Resend the updated form with
   your choices to announce@webster.ibmlink.ibm.com. For example:

     To: announce@webster.ibmlink.ibm.com
     _ HARDWARE (HW000)
       _ Processors (HW100)
         _ Large (Mainframes, Enterprise Systems, Large Scale)(HW110)
         S AS/400 Business Computing Systems and Servers (HW120)
         _ Advanced Work Stations (RISC/6000, AIX) (HW130)
         _ Personal Systems (PC Series, ThinkPads) (HW140)
         S Supercomputers (HW150)
         _ Parallel Processors (HW160)
         ...

   In this example, the user "selects" (to subscribe to) two categories:
   AS/400 Business Computing Systems...(HW120) and Supercomputers
   (HW150).

B. Alternately, you can simply send a new e-mail with the keyword SELECT
   in the body of the e-mail (leave the subject blank), followed by the
   category descriptor codes (the 5 characters in () at the end of the
   category descriptor) to announce@webster.ibmlink.ibm.com. For
   example, to subscribe to AS/400 Business Computing ...(HW120) and
   Supercomputers (HW150), send the following e-mail:

     To: announce@webster.ibmlink.ibm.com
     Subject:
     SELECT HW120 HW150

Getting Detailed US Announcement Letters
----------------------------------------

A. If your e-mail facility allows you to forward/resend the e-mail that
   contains the US Announcement Letter titles, place a "G" (for Get) to
   the left of the letter title. Resend the updated form, with your
   request for ASCII output for the selected announcement letters, to
   announce@webster.ibmlink.ibm.com. For example:

     To: announce@webster.ibmlink.ibm.com
     Hardware
       G 194405  Cooperative Hardware Withdrawal: CBIS CD Tower
       _ 194404  Options by IBM: Storage Products
       G 194401  IBM 7135 Radiant Array Feature Enhancements
       _ 194399  IBM 3174 Establishment Controller Model 95R
       ...

   In this example, the user requests to "get" the ASCII versions of
   US Announcement Letters 194405 and 194401.

B. Alternately, you can send a separate e-mail with the keyword GET in
   the body of the e-mail (leave subject blank), followed by the US
   Announcement Letter number (the 6 digits that precede the
   announcement letter title) to announce@webster.ibmlink.ibm.com. For
   example, to get US announcement letters 194405 and 194401, send the
   following e-mail:

     To: announce@webster.ibmlink.ibm.com
     Subject:
     GET 194405 194401

C. If you prefer to obtain the US Announcement Letter(s) by fax, call
   1-800-IBM-4FAX within the USA (24 hours/day, 7 days/week service),
   then:
   1. Select main menu option "2 -- Know your document number"
   2. Enter the 6 digit US Announcement Letter number as the document
      number, e.g, 194405. Note: Only five US Announcement Letters) can
      be selected at a time with this service.
   3. Follow directions to enter the receiving fax machine number

Unselecting a Category
----------------------

A. If your e-mail facility allows you to forward/resend the e-mail that
   contains the category form, place a "U" (for unselect) to the left of
   the category description. Resend the updated form with your choices
   to announce@webster.ibmlink.ibm.com. For example:

     To: announce@webster.ibmlink.ibm.com
     _ HARDWARE (HW000)
       _ Processors (HW100)
         _ Large (Mainframes, Enterprise Systems, Large Scale)(HW110)
         U AS/400 Business Computing Systems and Servers (HW120)
         _ Advanced Work Stations (RISC/6000, AIX) (HW130)
         _ Personal Systems (PC Series, ThinkPads) (HW140)
         U Supercomputers (HW150)
         _ Parallel Processors (HW160)
        ...

   In this example, the user unselects 2 categories: AS/400 (HW120) and
   Supercomputers (HW150).

B. Alternately, you can simply send a new e-mail with the keyword SELECT
   in the body of the e-mail (leave subject blank), followed by the
   negative (minus) sign "-" and the category description codes (the 5
   characters in () at the end of the category descriptor) to
   announce@webster.ibmlink.ibm.com. For example, to unselect AS/400
   (HW120) and Supercomputers (HW150), send the following e-mail:

     To: announce@webster.ibmlink.ibm.com
     Subject:
     SELECT -HW120 -HW150

   The above example unsubscribes you from the AS/400 Business Computing
   Systems and Servers (HW120) and Supercomputers (HW150) categories.

Delivering on its "any-client-to-any server" strategy for transaction
processing, IBM announcing the first CICS transaction processing
software clients that allow PC users to connect to any computer server
that runs CICS software.

The connectivity gives customers new flexibility in building
client/server transaction processing environments on which businesses
depend for online commerce, such as electronic funds transfer or sales
information.

New versions of existing CICS software servers are also announced for
OS/2 and AIX operating systems.

CICS is IBM's industry-leading transaction processing software used by
90 percent of the Fortune 500 companies. It provides a high-performance
software environment in which to run business applications, and helps
solve the portability, interoperability, and scalability issues that
customers face when deploying applications across a multi-vendor
network.

"Our customers have long valued and relied upon CICS to run their
day-to-day applications," said Don Haile, general manager of IBM's
Networking Software Division. "With these announcements, we are
providing our customers with an even easier way to run their key
applications on client/server systems, and to integrate them with their
current desktop tools."

CICS Clients
------------

The new CICS software clients will run on OS/2, Windows, DOS, and
Macintosh. They can directly access all CICS software servers, which
scale from PCs to mainframe systems, and support a variety of Local Area
Network (LAN) environments including OS/2 and NetWare.

CICS Servers
------------

CICS for AIX V1.2 enhances CICS as the leading transaction-processing
software for UNIX, with significant performance gains, improved
installation and configuration, and client support.

CICS for OS/2 V2.0.1 reinforces OS/2 Warp for business-critical
computing, with enhanced application-development capabilities and
client support.

IBM also announces new client features for CICS for MVS/ESA that will
let customers connect CICS clients and UNIX systems to mainframe CICS
applications.

Industry Support for Client/Server CICS
---------------------------------------

The new CICS clients give customers and software vendors the opportunity
to access and exploit business-critical information directly from their
standard desktop packages. Software vendors are already recognizing the
value of bringing the power of CICS to the desktop:

"More and more companies are coming to depend on Lotus Notes to compress
the time and improve the results of everyday business processes. Many
companies also rely on CICS to manage their business-critical
applications and data," said Jeff Papows, Vice President, Lotus
Communications Products Division. "The new CICS clients offer an
opportunity to users of Lotus Notes and other Lotus desktop products to
easily integrate these two very diverse environments in a seamless
fashion."

Open Blueprint
--------------

This announcement is consistent with the IBM Open Blueprint, which
is the market-leading approach for open, distributed computing. Since
it incorporates a range of standards, the Open Blueprint offers the best
assurance that businesses can build, run and manage distributed

                    | The IBM LAN Server Family |               servfam
                    +---------------------------+

The IBM LAN Server family of products supports all major IBM operating
systems. From a single DOS, DOS/Windows, or OS/2 requester, you can
access data, and do file and print, on OS/2, AIX, AS/400, MVS, and VM
operating systems. This cross-platform support also provides a higher
level of security and administrative control than ever possible before;
AIX, AS/400, and MVS tape devices can back up your LAN, providing
centralized disaster recovery.

LAN Server 4.0, winner of Networld+Interop's Best of Show Award in 1994
with its industry-leading performance characteristics, makes
applications available faster to end users who need to get their jobs
done. Its exclusive drag-and-drop administration makes it easier to
manage users, groups, and resources on the LAN, and easier to use than
any network operating system in the marketplace today.

Other features in LAN Server include: peer capability for DOS,
DOS/Windows, and OS/2 workstations; network cut-and-paste; native
TCP/IP; and network DDE support.

IBM OS/2 LAN Server 4.0 Entry
-----------------------------

LAN Server 4.0 Entry is the answer to file and print requirements for a
remote site. This version of LAN Server was designed to eliminate the
need for a dedicated server. At remote sites, a single workstation can
function as a server or "super-peer", communications gateway, network
file system server, and data server. This makes LAN Server Entry the
low-cost solution for remote sites.

LAN Server 4.0 Entry highlights:

o  LAN Server Entry delivers on ease of use with its graphical
   drag-and-drop administration designed for the new or casual user. At
   the same time, all administrative tasks can be automated through
   simple batch files, macros, or programs.

o  LAN Server Entry supports up to 100 users with throughput equivalent
   to that of LAN Server Advanced. When you need to support more users,
   it is simple to upgrade to 1000-user support with LAN Server
   Advanced.

o  LAN Server Entry lets end users and network administrators work with
   LAN resources as though are on a single server. Users and
   administrators do not need to be concerned with the location of the
   information -- they just have to use it!

Overall, LAN Server Entry provides a low-cost alternative, is easily
upgradeable, allows multiple applications to run on the same
workstation, and provides the ability to share data and print across the
network.

IBM OS/2 LAN Server 4.0 Advanced
--------------------------------

LAN Server Advanced, in addition to having the features of LAN Server
Entry, provides the high availability, performance, and serviceability
needed in larger installations. Disk mirroring and duplexing, UPS
support, and hot-swappable disk drives enable a network to stay up and
running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

The High Performance File System (HPFS) provides the fastest file and
print support in the industry. According to LANQuest LABS, "For a server
with a single CPU and 800 equivalent users, LAN Server Advanced was 38
percent faster than Windows NT Server and 11 percent faster than NetWare
...  LAN Server Advanced had the best performance at every load point
from 200 to 800 equivalent users ..." (This LANQuest report is available
from 1-800-IBM-4FAX as document number 2014.)

LAN Server 4.0 Advanced highlights:

o  LAN Server Advanced supports up to 1000 users in large installations
   that want to reduce costs and consolidate applications on a single
   server.

o  Pentium optimization exploits the advanced characteristics of the
   Pentium microprocessor architecture.

o  Disk mirroring and duplexing keeps users running in the event of a
   disk failure; users will be unaware that a failure has occurred.

o  SMP support is provided in conjunction with OS/2 SMP. Think of LAN
   Server as the "Mainframe for Windows" application.

o  TCP/IP support is now included on the server and all clients, making
   it possible to build end-to-end routeable networks.

o  Network SignON Coordinator/2 is included at no charge, so that end
   users can have a single logon to multiple LAN Server domains, NetWare
   servers, and AS/400, MVS, and VM systems.

LAN Server Advanced gives enterprises a network operating system that
provides reliability, availability, and serviceability. It connects to
other IBM hosts on a LAN, and serves as a gateway to NetWare and UNIX
servers.

IBM LAN Server/400
------------------

LAN Server/400 combines the best of LAN Server 4.0 and the AS/400. With
over 20,000 line-of-business applications available on the AS/400, and
the speed, stability, and ease of use of LAN Server, LAN Server/400 can
be your LAN solution. LAN Server/400 is designed to provide performance
and integrated administration, security, and data.

LAN Server/400 highlights:

o  Security is integrated between the AS/400 and the LAN Server network.
   When the system operator creates a user profile on the AS/400, that
   user profile is created and synchronized with the LAN Server domain.
   This helps increase security on a LAN by providing a single point of
   maintenance.

o  Data is integrated between the AS/400 and LAN Server servers on the
   network. Applications can now access data either on the AS/400
   relational database or on remote LAN Servers on the network. LAN
   Server is able to take advantage of the reliability and disk capacity
   of the AS/400. Up to 128 GB of storage can be allocated for each PC
   file system.

o  LAN Server/400 administration provides OS/400 commands to configure,
   to save and restore, and to move and copy data. An AS/400 can issue
   CL commands to run these activities locally or across the LAN. This
   enables LAN Server/400 administrators to use their existing AS/400
   skills to administer and automate LAN activities such as backup and
   restore, error detection, and PC server monitoring.

IBM LAN Server for AIX
----------------------

LAN Server for AIX brings together data on AIX systems with data on the
LAN for DOS, DOS/Windows, and OS/2 client workstations. LAN Server for
AIX has the same drag-and-drop administration as LAN Server 4.0.
Applications can seamlessly reside on RISC/6000 systems running LAN
Server for AIX, or on Intel-based computers running LAN Server 4.0.
Users and administrators are aware only that the applications and
printers are being made available to them -- not where they reside.

LAN Server for AIX key features for Intel clients:

o  Access to high-availability features of the AIX HACMP/6000 offerings
   is available. By using off-the-shelf components in conjunction with
   software, HACMP/6000 can provide an environment where no single point
   of failure exists.

o  Access is available to advanced features of the AIX file system, such
   as dynamic resizing and relocation, the ability to span multiple
   physical disks, and transaction logging that provides total recovery
   of critical data in the event of a power outage.

IBM LAN Server for MVS and VM
-----------------------------

IBM LAN Server for MVS and VM brings the power of the mainframe down to
the LAN. Mainframe DASD and tape can be a central repository for data or
for backup and recovery. Provided as an integral part of MVS 5.2, and in
conjunction with LAN Server 4.0, IBM LAN Server for MVS and VM affords a
low-risk method of distributing applications and data on your LAN. For
many environments, the reuse of System/390 resources is substantially
less expensive than implementing and managing a unique outboard storage
subsystem.

LAN Server for MVS and VM is designed to:

o  Provide a workstation-compatible file system on System/390

o  Provide high performance and transparent access to System/390
   resources

o  Reduce the LAN administrator's workload by leveraging System/390
   resources and services

o  Support transparent sharing of data between clients of LAN Server for
   MVS and VM

LAN Server for MVS and VM leverages all the information technology
assets of a company. The skills of the network administrator can be
best utilized working on LAN connectivity, while the backup and recovery
skills of the central information systems organization can provide the
highest levels of availability and reliability. All resources, whether
on MVS, VM, AS/400, AIX, or OS/2, are provided transparently to end
users and administrators. All told, this is a true single-system-image
model for your network.

IBM LAN Server 3.0 Still Available
----------------------------------

Since many customers have two- and three-year rollout cycles across the
enterprise, IBM is continuing to market LAN Server 3.0.

LAN Server 3.0 can be managed by a LAN Server 4.0 client, and the
drag-and-drop administration interoperates between both releases. IBM
customers can continue to roll out LAN Server 3.0 on their servers while
managing the network from a LAN Server 4.0 client and taking advantage
of the many usability features in the newer version. With LAN Server
3.0, any DOS, DOS/Windows, or OS/2 workstation can access IBM and
non-IBM LAN resources no matter where they are located, and view them
as a single network.

LAN Server 3.0 turns as many as 1,000 disparate workstations into an
integrated system tailored to your business needs. Its advanced
administrative features give users a single logon to reach resources
residing on LAN Server or Microsoft LAN Manager.

A host of features give you greater reliability and faster access to
network resources. Each of two versions -- Entry and Advanced --
features remote installation, extensive language support for worldwide
use, and support of industry-standard Uninterrupted Power Supplies.

           | Software Association and IBM Enter Into |          provpref
           |  Preferred Provider Program Agreement   |
           +-----------------------------------------+

IBM, the world's largest software vendor, and the Chicago Software
Association (CSA) announce a Preferred Provider Agreement in which IBM
will provide software manufacturing, distribution services, and product
packaging services to CSA-member software publishers at a
volume-discounted rate.

The Chicago Software Association (CSA) is a private, not-for-profit
corporation serving as an industry trade association for software firms
in the Chicago metropolitan area.

One-Stop Total Outsourcing
--------------------------

"This program reinforces IBM's commitment to being a one-stop shopping
center for total outsourcing," said Michael P. Kiyosaki, director of
marketing, IBM Software Manufacturing Solutions (ISMS). "We have
streamlined our product manufacturing and management system for ease of
use, with several standard options that members can choose from to bring
their products to market. The program provides CSA members with
economies of scale that are traditionally available only to the largest
software developers and information providers."

Take Advantage of IBM Rates
---------------------------

CSA-member software publishers of any size can take advantage of IBM's
rates to help reduce the cost of building and delivering software to end
users. ISMS is able to enter into this Preferred Provider Agreement with
CSA based on the number of current ISMS clients who are also CSA
members. The Preferred Provider Agreement helps meet CSA's goal of
improving the overall climate for software companies in America's
"silicon prairie."

Benefits to CSA Members
-----------------------

The cost-related benefits for CSA members include significantly
discounted replication and order fulfillment services, improved cash
flow, and reduced shipping costs using IBM's negotiated rates for any
shipping method. Inventory benefits include just-in-time inventory
control, minimized inventory levels, and minimal inventory scrap costs.
Other customer service and publisher benefits include a short product
release cycle, 48- to 72-hour product delivery from receipt of an order,
access to IBM's global distribution capabilities, and access to other
IBM services such as foreign language translation, localization for
foreign markets, and electronic distribution technologies.

How the Program Works
---------------------

First, the CSA-member software publisher selects from a variety of
choices. For print-on-demand documentation, publishers can select from
two types of virgin paper, two types of recycled paper, and several
types of bindings. For kits, publishers can select from a variety of
generic box sizes from existing inventory, and customize them with
product sleeves that slip over the generic boxes. For replication,
publishers can select diskette, tape, or compact disc (CD).

Then, the publisher's product structures are loaded into the ISMS
production system in Boulder. When the publisher's customer places an
order by fax, E-mail, or electronic data interchange (EDI) using the IBM
Global Network, ISMS fills the order in 48 to 72 hours, depending on the
size of the order and the availability of the components. ISMS sends
shipping confirmations for all orders daily, and provides inventory
management reports monthly.

CSA Mission
-----------

The mission of CSA is to provide an environment in which Chicago area
software firms can thrive and achieve a competitive advantage.
Activities offered by CSA include providing networking opportunities and
contracting with preferred providers for discounted services such as
telephone service, software replication, and fulfillment services.

IBM plans to offer all the CDs in the Right At Home Software Series
through major retail stores, continuing its emphasis on working within
the channel. Currently, the SOHO CD is available in 26 PC Warehouse
stores, with more retailers planned in the future.

"Unlike shrink-wrapped products that require customers to know what they
want before they buy, the Right At Home Software Series lets customers
try or compare products before making a purchase," said Michael P.
Kiyosaki, director of marketing, IBM Software Manufacturing Solutions.
"IBM has done the 'pre-shopping' for customers by selecting the highest
quality products, grouping them logically by theme, and combining them
onto one inexpensive CD." Customers can purchase the CD, try or compare
software products, view marketing materials, and then buy the preferred
products directly from their home or office at any time of the day or
night.

Free Software and Money-Saving Offers
-------------------------------------

Plus, customers receive free software and money-saving offers with the
purchase of any Right At Home Software Series CD. On the SOHO CD,
customers get 150 USD worth of free software and more than 300 USD in
money-saving offers.

Each Right At Home Software Series CD contains a variety of software
products. Software publishers participating on the SOHO CD include
4Home Productions; Caere Corporation; Cybermedia; Delrina; IMSI;

A customer purchases any CD in the Right At Home Software Series at a
major retail store typically for about 10 USD, inserts the CD into a
home or office personal computer CD drive, and then reviews a variety of
software products and promotional demos. To purchase a product, the
customer calls the toll-free telephone number provided, arranges for
credit-card payment, and receives a code that instantly releases the
product and any related documentation for installation. The customer
receives any full documentation by mail.

Introductory Free Products
--------------------------

IBM encourages you to install the CD and begin your shop-at-home
experience by ordering any of three free, exciting products:

-  PC 911
-  Official Airline Guide FlightDisk (one month free)
-  Simply Money

Benefits to Publishers, Retailers, and Consumers
------------------------------------------------

For software publishers, the Right At Home Software Series offers
substantial marketing, merchandising, and production-cost benefits.
Participation in this innovative marketing program from IBM Software
Manufacturing Solutions lowers the cost of goods sold while letting
publishers penetrate new markets and capture valuable registration data
with each purchase. When a publisher agrees to participate and a product
is selected for a theme CD, IBM handles manufacturing, encryption,
production costs, registration, and documentation fulfillment.
Publishers receive royalties each time a customer purchases a product.

For retailers/resellers, the Right At Home Software Series means lower
inventory costs, lower "returns" costs, and increased customer
satisfaction through pre-purchase product reviewing. Software retailers
can expand software product offerings without increasing shelf space
requirements and other overhead costs. For retailers looking to enter
the software market, the Right At Home Software Series provides a
low-risk way to offer customers a variety of software products with
minimal cost and effort. The retailer earns a margin on each CD sold,
plus healthy net rebates each time a customer purchases a product at
home. IBM handles order entry, licensing and registration, disbursement
of publisher royalties, and other administrative functions.

For consumers, the Right At Home Software Series brings the convenience
of reviewing, purchasing, and installing software directly to the
customer's desktop.  And, with each CD, customers also receive free
software in addition to special pricing and discounts on future software
purchases.

MONDAY 22 MAY

 8:50-10:05 am

Keynote Address:

Leveraging APPN with New             Gary Weis, President and Chief
Networking Technologies              Operating Officer, Advantis

The demand for faster, more reliable networks is increasing rapidly.
Leveraging investments in current technologies with new technologies,
such as ATM, can be a challenge. Mr. Weis offers his unique perspective
on how to combine existing SNA, APPC, and APPN implementations with
investments in the new emerging technology infrastructure."

APPN Industry Perspective            David Passmore, President, Decisis,
                                     Inc.

"Hot" networking transports like APPN, TCP/IP, Frame Relay, or ATM each
have situations in which they work best. This presentation provides an
independent network consultant point of view of where APPN is likely to
succeed in the marketplace, including which types of customer
enterprises, vertical industries, and application environments are
likely to deploy APPN vs. other types of networks.

Breakout Sessions:

Introduction to APPC                 Anne Schick, APPC Market
                                     Enablement, IBM

APPC is the most widely used communication protocol for distributed
applications. This presentation demystifies the terms and concepts of
APPC so you can begin your client/server application development.
Easy-to-understand examples and analogies help prepare you for other
sessions in the conference.

Overview of APPC, APPN, CPI-C        Wayne Riley, Network Applications
Terminology and Technology           Enablement, IBM

If you have some experience with APPC, APPN, or CPI-C, this session
offers you a fast-paced overview of these technologies. We review
important terms and concepts that are used in other sessions.
________________________________________________________________________

 2:30- 3:30 pm

Breakout Sessions:

What is APPN?                        Mel Jones, APPC Market Enablement,
                                     IBM

APPN represents the latest stage in the development of SNA. APPN
provides the routing dynamics and ease of use required for today's
distributed networks. This session gives you a high-level overview of
APPN features that help reduce the time and effort required to define
and maintain your network.

APPN Through the Looking Glass       Ralph Case, Manager, APPN
                                     Architecture, IBM

This session explains some of the functions of an APPN network and the
distributed algorithms and components that provide them. We show how
data is transported, how LUs are located and routes are selected, and
how APPN control points communicate with each other to make the whole
network operate. We also discuss some of the newer extensions to APPN.

 3:30- 4:45 pm

Breakout Sessions:

The Basics of APPC                   Jill Bodine, APPC Market
Programming with CPI-C               Enablement, IBM

CPI-C provides a standard interface to the APPC functions. This
presentation describes how to use CPI-C to begin and end APPC
conversations and to exchange data. We discuss five classic transaction
models and walk through working CPI-C code samples.

Simplifying Your                    John C. Broughton III, SNA Studies,
Networks with AnyNet                IBM

Corporations are facing dual challenges in the 90s: consolidating their
network backbone protocols around APPN and TCP/IP and implementing a
solution for LAN internetworking. This session discusses how IBM's
AnyNet products meet these challenges and compares the AnyNet approach
to other solutions.

TUESDAY 23 MAY

 8:30- 9:15 am

The Future of APPN                   David Bryant, Director of SNA
Interoperability                     Technology, 3Com Corporation

This session tracks the the evolution of APPN with a brief look at its
beginnings through its status today. We also look at where APPN is
heading, and the APPN Implementers Workshop (AIW) and its role as a
multi-vendor SNA standards body which is shaping the APPN networks of
tomorrow.

 9:45-10:45 am

APPN and TCP/IP: A Comparison        Steve Joyce, Manager, Strategy
                                     and Market Enablement, IBM

Almost everyone in the networking industry is dealing with both TCP/IP
and APPC/APPN. Frequently, we have to decide which will be used for an
application, or even a network backbone. In this session, we compare the
strengths and weaknesses of the two solutions.

The Developer Connection for OS/2
---------------------------------

Volume 4 is now available for 75 CDN for a single issue. A four-issue
subscription (covering one year) costs 225 CDN.

The Developer Connection for OS/2 is a program that delivers the most
current information, tools, and pre-release code available from IBM and
Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) to developers in support of their
continuing application development on the OS/2 platform.

The cornerstone of The Developer Connection for OS/2 is two CD-ROMs plus
The Developer Connection News. The CD-ROMs and newspaper are updated and
released four times per year.

The Developer Connection CD-ROMs contain pre-release programs that are
licensed for 120 days or until the next Developer Connection CD-ROM is
available, whichever comes first. Canadian DAP members will be notified
of the next release via the regular mailing, and there are postings on
CompuServe.

To use the CD-ROM, you must have a CD-ROM drive attached to your
computer system, with the necessary drivers that work under OS/2 2.x.
The Developer Connection News lists the OS/2-supported CD-ROM drives;
additional device drivers are available from third-party vendors.

The Developer Connection also operates a forum on CompuServe that
provides fast, responsive answers to your questions and problems.

To order The Developer Connection for OS/2 in Canada, call
1-800-561-5293.

Certification Programs
----------------------

Canadian DAP members can certify their applications as compatible with
OS/2 or LAN Server. The process entails self-certification. For each
product that you want to certify, the certification package sells for 30
CDN plus applicable taxes. After receiving the package, you do the
self-certification test, and then send it to IBM for verification, along
with a not-for-sale copy of the product you are certifying.

To start the process of certifying your applications, call
1-800-992-4777 and request the appropriate package:

To certify ...                Ask for ...

OS/2 applications             OS/2 certification package

DOS applications              DOS certification package

               +-----------------------------------------+

As the computer industry shifts to new forms of development to meet the
demands of client/server computing, the abilities of the software
developer also need to evolve and expand. Fully exploiting the power and
potential of the latest advanced operating systems, together with
related products and technologies, places heavy demands on developers.

For software developers using IBM's OS/2 and OS/2-based products, the
IBM Developer Assistance Program in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA
DAP) meets these demands, and provides much more besides.

The EMEA DAP is open to any developer in EMEA who is actively developing
for OS/2, be it a device driver, a commercial product, a
line-of-business application, or a set of SOM objects.

Join the EMEA DAP and move into the fast lane of OS/2 development!

Bulletin-Board Service and CD-ROMs
----------------------------------

As a DAP member, you can access our dedicated EMEA DAP Bulletin Board
Service (BBS) and benefit from the wealth of tools, information, and
advice that we make available.

The BBS is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It enables
fellow OS/2 developers around the world to exchange ideas and
information, getting rapid responses from the experts. Support is
provided by our own OS/2 Certified Engineers, developers in the IBM
programming labs, and even other DAP members.

Our electronic repositories provide a comprehensive collection of many
IBM-developed OS/2 tools, documentation, fixes, sample code, electronic
newsletters, news items, and marketing material to support your
development efforts. We periodically mail out the latest offers to EMEA
DAP members, as well as DAP Library CD-ROMs, which conveniently package
together much of the information available on the bulletin board, making
this information readily accessible.

In order to make the BBS connection affordable for the developer, we
have installed local systems in many countries throughout EMEA, which
shadow the central BBS machine in Basingstoke UK. Members of the DAP in
those countries now no longer need to make an international telephone
call to connect to the DAP BBS. Local access to the DAP BBS will be
provided in more countries in the near future.

And what's more, it is all currently free of charge!

Discounts
---------

Selected promotions and discounts may be available when purchasing IBM
PC hardware, OS/2 software, and OS/2-related publications. These
discount programs vary by country, and your local IBM DAP contact will
be pleased to tell you if such a program is available in your country.

Technical Seminars
------------------

Technical seminars are held several times per year in different
countries, and the DAP program provides early information to members
about the dates and venues. These seminars are an excellent way to learn
about the latest developments in OS/2, and talk directly with the IBM
developers themselves.

HelpFax
-------

IBM HelpFax is an automated document-delivery system available on demand
from your telephone, 24 hours a day. HelpFax offers a wide variety of
information about IBM products and services, including "What's New",
"Operating Systems", "Networking", "Database and Client/Server", through

be sent directly to your specified fax machine.

Application Marketing
---------------------

IBM support does not end once you have developed your product ... We
have a variety of marketing programs to help you market your OS/2
product to the OS/2 community around the world. Most are free, but
others are available at a nominal charge to help cover costs. Details
about the current programs will be posted on the BBS or mailed out.

CompuServe Support
------------------

The IBM Worldwide Developer Assistance Program provides a complimentary
service which is open to individuals without company or product
prerequisites. Worldwide DAP services include a variety of technical,
business, and marketing support services, provided through CompuServe.

information service or by requesting an enrollment form from Internet.

Programming Tools and Information
---------------------------------

The EMEA DAP, through the BBS and DAP Library CD-ROMs, provides
developers with the latest OS/2 programming tools and information that
are generally (freely) available. An essential complement to our
services is The Developer Connection for OS/2, which provides additional
professional tools, utilities, product demos, information, and sample
code from IBM and others.

          | Q and A About The Developer Connection for OS/2 |   devconqa
          +-------------------------------------------------+

Q1. What is The Developer Connection for OS/2?

A1. The Developer Connection for OS/2 is an annual subscription program
    for application developers. Its purpose is to deliver: licenses to
    developers for toolkits, productivity tools, development tools, and
    sample code; licenses to the latest pre-release code, so developers
    can prepare for and simulate future environments; and the most
    up-to-date versions of technical documentation about OS/2.

    The Developer Connection for OS/2 consists of four issues (CDs and a
    newsletter) delivered over the course of one year, plus access to
    The Developer Connection section of the OS2DF2 forum on CompuServe
    until the subscription expires.

    For those subscribers who are not members of CompuServe, IBM has

    the US Developer Assistance Program may purchase The Developer
    Connection at a reduced price, 119 USD for an annual subscription
    and 45 USD for each additional license. US members of the
    Worldwide DAP, however, purchase The Developer Connection at the
    regular 199 USD price.

    European DAP members may purchase The Developer Connection at a
    reduced rate. When members call to order, the operators will give
    the reduced price in the appropriate currency.

Q4. What does The Developer Connection CD contain?

A4. The CD(s) contains pre-release versions of many IBM OS/2 and LAN
    products, internal development and productivity tools, bitmaps, and
    demos of products from IBM and others. Each CD also includes the
    latest release level of The Developer's Toolkit for OS/2, the
    Multimedia Presentation Manager Toolkit/2, and the Pen for OS/2
    Developer's Toolkit. In addition to these programs, the CD contains
    sample source code that can be used to develop your own
    applications. The CD also contains thousands of pages of
    documentation, with a search facility.

Q5. What advantages do I get from the CompuServe forum for DevCon that
    I didn't have before?

A5. Subscribing to The Developer Connection entitles you to access the
    private Developer Connection section of the OS2DF2 forum on
    CompuServe. IBM developers will be answering questions and carrying
    on dialogs with subscribers on a full-time basis and will respond to
    your comments/issues/questions on a timely basis.

Q6. How many copies of DevCon do I have to subscribe to for my
    company? I have many programmers, do I have to buy one for each?

A6. After your company has purchased its initial subscription to The
    Developer Connection, you may buy as many additional licenses as you
    want. For each additional license you order, 4 times over the year
    you will receive the current newsletter and a Proof of Additional
    License certificate, which entitles you to make one additional copy
    of the contents of the current CD volume. Additional licenses work
    best for Local Area Network development environments. (Example; If
    you have 10 developers on a LAN, you could buy one regular license
    and 9 additional licenses.)

Q7. I've heard that the DevCon program will grow in the future. What
    will I see over the next year?

A7. The Developer Connection for Image Plus Visualinfo was just
    recently announced. Future direction for The Developer Connection
    has not been announced; however, we are considering CDs for specific
    areas of interest to developers such as: Device Driver Source, AIX,
    Object Oriented, etc.

Q8. Does my license to use the release-level toolkits contained on
    The Developer Connection CD end if I do not renew my subscription at
    the end of my annual membership?

A8. In general, the license to use the code on each Developer Connection
    CD is shipped with the CD and expires 120 days after receipt of that
    issue or upon receipt of the next CD issue, whichever comes first.
    However, your licenses to the following toolkits continue beyond
    expiration of your subscription: The Developer's Toolkit for OS/2,
    Multimedia Presentation Manager Toolkit/2, and Pen for OS/2
    Developer's Toolkit. As long as you adhere to the terms and
    conditions of the agreement, your license to the abovementioned
    toolkits does not terminate.

Q9. Is the Developer Connection program available outside North America?

A9. The DevCon program has been announced in the US, Canada, Europe,
    Middle East, Africa, Mexico, Brazil, and the Asia / Pacific
    countries. It is currently available in all of these geographies.
