            | Pilot Workshop - Warp System Debug Tools:    |    lldebug
            | Basic Skills for Low-Level Program Diagnosis |
            +----------------------------------------------+

A two-day pilot workshop, "Warp System Debug Tools: Basic Skills for
Low-Level Program Diagnosis", will be held at the IBM site in Austin,
Texas on 25 and 26 January. Attendance for this pilot is free.

About the Course
----------------

In this two-day workshop, students become familiar with the way Warp
uses the x86 hardware to implement virtual storage. Students are taught
how descriptors work, what descriptor tables exist, how page tables are
used, and the resulting virtual storage environment in Warp. The lecture
is oriented to understanding exactly why a trap occurs. Students also
learn to read assembler instructions, and how the registers are
typically used. Additionally, students are taught how a stack operates.

This workshop is a combination of classroom lectures and hands-on lab
work. The student will spend a significant portion of the workshop using
a debugger to display descriptors, page tables, registers and storage,
and watching the execution of individual instructions.

Audience
--------

Programmers and support personnel who want to learn how to debug
software by using Warp system debug tools, those who want to learn how
Warp implements the virtual storage environment, and those who want to
build the basic skills needed to attend the next workshop in this
series, Diagnosing Traps in Application Programs.

Objectives
----------

o  Learn how the hardware is exploited to create the virtual storage
   environment of WARP.

o  Learn to read assembler instructions.

o  Learn to display the various components that go into resolving a
   virtual address, as well as how to display storage a number of ways.

o  Learn what the information on a trap screen means.

o  Learn what documentation can be made available for diagnostic
   purposes, and how to collect it successfully.

Topics
------

o  What x86 protection mechanisms exist, and how they work
o  Descriptors, descriptor tables, and how to find them
o  Paging, page tables, and how to find them
o  Selector, general, and system registers
o  Reading assembler instructions, and watching them run
o  What a stack is, and how to mine the data it contains
o  Directed lab exercises

Benefits
--------

The workshop will provide a broad base of understanding how the hardware
works, and how WARP uses it to create the execution environment for 16-
and 32-bit programs.

Prerequisites
-------------

Prerequisites include some programming skills; a good understanding of
arrays, structures, pointers, and linked lists; ability to do
hex-to-binary conversions; ability to use OS/2.

WordPerfect Corporation.

The Product Marketing Handbook
------------------------------

All attendees receive a copy of The Product Marketing Handbook, a
comprehensive workbook that demonstrates and reinforces the principles
taught in the forum. It contains extensive checklists that detail the
product marketing tasks used by successful marketers.

Forum Fee
---------

Each session costs 1,495 USD per attendee, and can be taught in on-site
or off-site classrooms.

Optional FREE Focus Session
---------------------------

Following each three-day forum, a fourth day of custom consulting is
offered to attendees at no extra cost. At this optional session,
students can focus in greater detail on their specific marketing
problems and challenges, using what they learned in class, reinforced
with individual consulting by the instructors.

                    | OS/2 Sales Soar in Europe |                eursoar
                    +---------------------------+

IBM announces that sales of OS/2 in Europe have increased by 120 percent
over the past twelve months. Over two million copies were sold in Europe
between January and November 1994, and over 800,000 copies of OS/2 Warp
have been sold worldwide since the product's launch in October 1994.

OS/2 Warp Preloads
------------------

The rapid acceleration in sales will be strengthened by OS/2 Warp's
strong performance in the preload market. For example, in Germany,
Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) -- Vobis, Escom, Comtech, and
Peacock -- have recently signed pan-European deals to preload Warp.
These deals account for 40 percent of the German preload market. IBM
expects to announce further significant European preload agreements in
the first quarter of 1995.

Robust Sales
------------

Sales have been particularly robust in France, Germany, Italy, the
Nordic countries, and the UK. Dealers and distributors across Europe are
reporting strong demand and sales.

Thousands of Retail Outlets
---------------------------

IBM now has 5,000 retail outlets throughout Europe selling OS/2 Warp,
and expects to double this figure early in 1995. Retail chains include
Carrefour and FNAC in France, Dixons in the UK, Funtronics in the
Netherlands, and Magic 32SR in Italy.

                |  3 - 4 April, Santa Clara CA   |
                +--------------------------------+

The next IBM International Seminar is scheduled for 3 and 4 April 1995
at the Marriott Hotel in Santa Clara, California. The target audience
includes software engineers and technical managers who design and
develop software for international markets. Both NLS (national language
support) and DBCS (double-byte character set) considerations are
covered.  The program is offered to independent software vendors and
customers.

Guidelines for Internationalizing Software
------------------------------------------

A team of technical experts from major IBM laboratories and consultant
firms provide detailed programming design guidelines for
internationalizing software. Topics range from a description of
worldwide writing systems and national-language-dependent functions to
translation and NLS specifications. Platform-specific information about
AIX, AS/400, DOS/V, OS/2, and System/390 is presented in individual
breakout sessions. There is a focus on current topics such as POSIX,
XPG and Unicode / UCS-2.

Schedule and Fee
----------------

The meeting takes two full days, including evening discussion groups.
Ample time is allowed for individual dialogue with the instructors.
The fee is 500 USD, including meals.

Hands-On Lab
------------

A separate program is offered on Wednesday 5 April in San Mateo, CA.
This will be a lab environment where AIX developers can gain hands-on
experience in internationalization. There is an additional fee for the
lab.

The cornerstone of The Developer Connection for OS/2 is two CD-ROMs plus
The Developer Connection News. The CD-ROMs and newspaper are updated and
released four times per year.

The Developer Connection CD-ROMs contain pre-release programs that are
licensed for 120 days or until the next Developer Connection CD-ROM is
available, whichever comes first. Canadian DAP members will be notified
of the next release via the regular mailing, and there are postings on
CompuServe.

To use the CD-ROM, you must have a CD-ROM drive attached to your
computer system, with the necessary drivers that work under OS/2 2.x.
The Developer Connection News lists the OS/2-supported CD-ROM drives;
additional device drivers are available from third-party vendors.

The Developer Connection also operates a forum on CompuServe that
provides fast, responsive answers to your questions and problems.

To order The Developer Connection for OS/2 in Canada, call
1-800-561-5293.

Certification Programs
----------------------

Canadian DAP members can certify their applications as compatible with
OS/2 or LAN Server. The process entails self-certification. For each
product that you want to certify, the certification package sells for 30
CDN plus applicable taxes. After receiving the package, you do the
self-certification test, and then send it to IBM for verification, along
with a not-for-sale copy of the product you are certifying.

To start the process of certifying your applications, call
1-800-992-4777 and request the appropriate package:

To certify ...                Ask for ...

As the computer industry shifts to new forms of development to meet the
demands of client/server computing, the abilities of the software
developer also need to evolve and expand. Fully exploiting the power and
potential of the latest advanced operating systems, together with
related products and technologies, places heavy demands on developers.

For software developers using IBM's OS/2 and OS/2-based products, the
IBM Developer Assistance Program in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA
DAP) meets these demands, and provides much more besides.

The EMEA DAP is open to any developer in EMEA who is actively developing
for OS/2, be it a device driver, a commercial product, a
line-of-business application, or a set of SOM objects.

Join the EMEA DAP and move into the fast lane of OS/2 development!

Bulletin-Board Service and CD-ROMs
----------------------------------

As a DAP member, you can access our dedicated EMEA DAP Bulletin Board
Service (BBS) and benefit from the wealth of tools, information, and
advice that we make available.

The BBS is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It enables
fellow OS/2 developers around the world to exchange ideas and
information, getting rapid responses from the experts. Support is
provided by our own OS/2 Certified Engineers, developers in the IBM
programming labs, and even other DAP members.

Our electronic repositories provide a comprehensive collection of many
IBM-developed OS/2 tools, documentation, fixes, sample code, electronic
newsletters, news items, and marketing material to support your
development efforts. We periodically mail out the latest offers to EMEA
DAP members, as well as DAP Library CD-ROMs, which conveniently package
together much of the information available on the bulletin board, making
this information readily accessible.

In order to make the BBS connection affordable for the developer, we
have installed local systems in many countries throughout EMEA, which
shadow the central BBS machine in Basingstoke UK. Members of the DAP in
those countries now no longer need to make an international telephone
call to connect to the DAP BBS. Local access to the DAP BBS will be
provided in more countries in the near future.

And what's more, it is all currently free of charge!

    Multimedia Presentation Manager Toolkit/2, and the Pen for OS/2
    Developer's Toolkit. In addition to these programs, the CD contains
    sample source code that can be used to develop your own
    applications. The CD also contains thousands of pages of
    documentation, with a search facility.

Q5. What advantages do I get from the CompuServe forum for DevCon that
    I didn't have before?

A5. Subscribing to The Developer Connection entitles you to access the
    private Developer Connection section of the OS2DF2 forum on
    CompuServe. IBM developers will be answering questions and carrying
    on dialogs with subscribers on a full-time basis and will respond to
    your comments/issues/questions on a timely basis.

Q6. How many copies of DevCon do I have to subscribe to for my
    company? I have many programmers, do I have to buy one for each?

A6. After your company has purchased its initial subscription to The
    Developer Connection, you may buy as many additional licenses as you
    want. For each additional license you order, 4 times over the year
    you will receive the current newsletter and a Proof of Additional
    License certificate, which entitles you to make one additional copy
    of the contents of the current CD volume. Additional licenses work
    best for Local Area Network development environments. (Example; If
    you have 10 developers on a LAN, you could buy one regular license
    and 9 additional licenses.)

Q7. I've heard that the DevCon program will grow in the future. What
    will I see over the next year?

A7. The Developer Connection for Image Plus Visualinfo was just
    recently announced. Future direction for The Developer Connection
    has not been announced; however, we are considering CDs for specific
    areas of interest to developers such as: Device Driver Source, AIX,
    Object Oriented, etc.

Q8. Does my license to use the release-level toolkits contained on
    The Developer Connection CD end if I do not renew my subscription at
    the end of my annual membership?

A8. In general, the license to use the code on each Developer Connection
    CD is shipped with the CD and expires 120 days after receipt of that
    issue or upon receipt of the next CD issue, whichever comes first.
    However, your licenses to the following toolkits continue beyond
    expiration of your subscription: The Developer's Toolkit for OS/2,
    Multimedia Presentation Manager Toolkit/2, and Pen for OS/2
    Developer's Toolkit. As long as you adhere to the terms and
    conditions of the agreement, your license to the abovementioned
    toolkits does not terminate.

Q9. Is the Developer Connection program available outside North America?

A9. The DevCon program has been announced in the US, Canada, Europe,
    Middle East, Africa, Mexico, Brazil, and the Asia / Pacific
    countries. It is currently available in all of these geographies.
