OS/2 System Resources - Comments

  This program provides a digital clock (with date), the elapsed time since
your system's last restart, the amount of free virtual memory, the current
swap-file size, the maximum amount the swap-file can still grow, the current
CPU load (%), the number of active tasks and the amount of disk space free on
each of your hard disks.  Each figure is updated once per second, or at
whatever interval from one to thirty seconds that you wish. Removable disk
drives (including CDs) are not supported at this time.

  I've provided the source code.  Feel free to borrow ideas from it, just
don't change the program and distribute it as if it were still my program.
If you would like to see new features, drop me a note.	My CompuServe ID
is 72607,3111, and I check my mail several times a week. I'm interested
in your comments.

  NOTE: If you'd like to see the program translated into another language,
feel free to make your own version of ENGLISH.DOC, ENGLISH.CMD, ENGLISH.RC
and ENGLISH.IPF.  Make your own version and send it to me via CompuServe mail,
and I'll build the HLP, DLL and make files and post the updated package
out to CompuServe for anyone to download.


Installation:

    Run the installation file ENGLISH.CMD.  It will ask you where you want
the program stored and whether you want it to be placed in the startup folder.
The job will create a program object and place it either on the desktop or
in the system startup folder.  This object will have all its attributes set
up correctly for running the program.

History:

  1.00 - Submitted to Compuserve's OS/2 Forum, early January, 1992.

  1.01 - Added single-line border.
         Removed default TaskList processing, added custom logic.

  1.10 - Added ability to hide controls.
         Added ability to be moved with the mouse, independent of title bar.
         Added help facility.
         Removed 'exit' option from system menu (Alt+F4 or F3 does fine).
	 Now searches CONFIG.SYS to find SWAPPATH.
	 Responds to WM_PRESPARAMCHANGED messages, allowing OS/2 2.0's
	   font, color and color scheme palettes to work with it properly.
	 Added CPU load indicator.
	 Added ability to select which items are to be monitored.
	 Added ability to reset presentation parameters to default state.

  1.20 - Restructured program to make status items easier to add.
	 Changed 'Swap-disk free space' to 'Available swap space'.
	 Added disk drive free space items.
	 Optimized window refresh logic.
	 Corrected minor bugs in handling font changes.

  1.21 - Fixed bug in computing swap-file size.

  1.22 - Fixed bug in computing available swapping space.

  1.23 - Fixed bugs in initial sizing and location of CONFIG.SYS.

  1.24 - Fixed underflow error in computing CPU load.

  1.25 - Fixed bug with determining swap-drive.

  1.26 - Switched from using COMSPEC to SYSTEM_INI when trying to determine
	   the boot drive in order to find CONFIG.SYS.	There have been
	   users with alternative command-line interpreters altering
	   COMSPEC to point to a different disk drive.	Something more
	   reliable was needed.  This is still not a perfect solution.

  1.27 - Fixed problem with initial positioning under OS/2 1.x.
	 If SYSTEM_INI cannot be found, look for COMSPEC instead.  If that
	   cannot be found, assume the boot drive to be current drive.

  1.28 - Fixed problem where title bar and system menu were not being
	   initialized correctly when the program started up with the
	   controls hidden.

  1.29 - Now skips removable drives during setup.
	 Now uses the Global Information Segment to determine boot drive,
	   and thereby the location of CONFIG.SYS.
	 Now accepts any color from the color palette.	It no longer forces
	   the use of solid colors.

  1.30 - Show Spool-file Size option added to program.
	 Fixed bug in adjusting options while program is minimized.

  1.31 - Changed to use DosFindFirst2 in spool-file search.
	 Minor clarity changes.

  1.40 - Added digital clock.

  1.41 - Added generic icon.  Had only the VGA definition before.

  1.42 - Responds to WM_SYSCOLORCHANGE message.
	 Fixed bug in spool directory scanning.

  1.50 (16 October 1992) -
    Uses country information to determine date/time format.
    Moved all language-dependent text to a DLL.
    Created separate DLLs for English and Spanish texts.
    Fixed bug in accessing network drives.
    Don't bother looking at disk drives A: or B:.
    Installation script for OS/2 2.0 added.

  1.51 (10 November 1992) -
    Code streamlining.
    Use country's thousands separator in numbers.
    Turn off timer while moving window with the mouse.
    German translation by Dr. H. Klaeren, University of Tubingen, Germany.

  1.52 (09 December 1992) -
    Added command-line parameter processing.
    Added RESET parameter to clear saved profile information.
    Added timer interval dialog.
    Added HELP option to menu.
    Fixed bug in installation procedure.
    Moved display item list to submenu.

  1.53 (28 December 1992) -
    Fixed for Novell Server drives.
    Split out debugging support to DEBUG.C & DEBUG.H.
    Revised translation to Spanish.
    Added translation to Catalan.
    Rewrote CPU usage function.

  1.54 (30 January 1993) -
    Added ALT+H accelerator for the hide controls menu function.
    Treat ERROR_NOT_READY as removable media.
    Rebuild menu and window when available drive list changes.
    Treat ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED as remote drive (TCP/IP).

  1.60 (08 March 1993) -
    Added ability to monitor the number of active tasks, according
      to the system switch list.
    Fixed bug with attempts to hide controls while minimized.
    Only checks drive types at startup and at time of NET USE.
    Precalibrates the CPU load meter if HRTIMER.SYS is available.

  1.61 (09 April 1993) -
    Now checks to see if a drive is remote before attempting to
      open it as a complete drive.  All remote drives get monitored.
      Only fixed local drives get monitored.
    Show drive file system names.
    Fixed bug in update of drive list.
    If a drive returns an error during poll, stop trying to poll it.
    Added item list resource lock.

  1.62 (03 May 1993) -
    Fixed bug where drive Z was not checked.
    Fixed bug where V-disks were not monitored.
    Fixed bug in monitoring CPU load in very fast machines.
