	   Pretty Good Privacy version 2.0 - READ ME FIRST


You are looking at the README file for PGP release 2.0.  PGP, short for
Pretty Good Privacy, is a public key encryption package; with it, you
can secure messages you transmit against unauthorized reading and
digitally sign them so that people receiving them can be sure they
come from you.

The files pgpdoc1.txt and pgpdoc2.txt contain documentation for the
system. 

Before using PGP, PLEASE READ THE DOCUMENTATION.  This tends to get
neglected with most computer software, but cryptography software is
easy to misuse, and if you don't use it properly much of the security
you could gain by using it will be lost!  You might also be unfamiliar
with the concepts behind public key cryptography; the manual explains
these ideas.  Even if you are already familiar with public key
cryptography, it is important that you understand the various security
issues associated with using PGP. 

The file SETUP.DOC contains information on how to install PGP on your
system; this document is broken up into several sections, each dealing
with a different operating system: PGP is known to run on MS-DOS,
UNIX, and VMS.  Part of the information in SETUP.DOC might make more
sense if you have already read the manuals.

The file MANIFEST in this distribution contains a list of files in
your distribution kit.


PGP 2.0, which was released on September 3, 1992, will likely be
followed by updated versions within a few months of the release date.
Bugs will likely be found and fixed, this being a new major release of
the software, ans we will try to get these fixes out to the public as
soon as possible.

Given this, if you have received PGP 2.0 substantially after the
initial release date, you may want to check around for a more recent
release.  If there is a more recent release, please acquire it, and
please get the place you got PGP 2.0 from to update their release,
too.


For Clinical Paranoia Sufferers Only
------------------------------------

It is always possible that the PGP you have received has been tampered
with in some way.  This is a risk because PGP is used as a system to
assure security, so those wishing to breach your security could likely
do it by making sure that your copy of PGP has been tampered with.  Of
course, if you receive PGP in a binary distribution, it makes sense to
check it for viruses, and if you receive PGP as source code, looking
for signs of obvious tampering might be a good idea.  However, it is
very difficult to actually determine if the code has no subtle bugs
that have been introduced and that the executable you are using has
not been tampered with in any way.  If you are a really paranoid
person, try getting a cryptographically signed copy of the software
from someone you trust to have a good copy.  It would also likely be
good for you to read the sections of the manual on "Vulnerabilities",
which you should have read anyway since you have read the
documentation already, haven't you?
