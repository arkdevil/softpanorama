This is the 'new, improvevd' GNU sed.  Please report all bugs, comments,
requests for features, etc to hack@gnu.ai.mit.edu or hack@wheaties.ai.mit.edu
or hack@media-lab.media.mit.edu or hack@lsrhs.UUCP (ONE of them should work.)

To compile sed, use something on the order of
cc -g -I. -o sed sed.c regex.c glob.c
or use the enclosed Makefile
If you don't have vfprintf(), add -DNO_VFPRINTF to the cc command, or
to the CFLAGS in the Makefile.
