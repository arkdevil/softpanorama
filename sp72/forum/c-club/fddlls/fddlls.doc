Purpose:
         FDDLLS helps you find unused DLLs on your system by finding, sorting and classifying Windows executable files. FDDLLS can list the EXE and DLL files on your system by name, extension or reference count.

Setup:

To install FDDLLS, simply copy it to a directory on your hard disk, and create an icon for it in Program Manager. Then double click on the icon to load the program.
   After FDDLLS is started, click on the Scan button to enable FDDLLS to search your hard disk for Windows executable files. You can specify which disks are to be scanned by clicking on the Select disks button. In general, all non-removable disks must be scanned for FDDLLS to properly work.
   FDDLLS lists the executable files and DLLs in order by name. Any EXE or DLL that requires DLLs not found on the machine are listed in red. Files with duplicate names are listed in yellow.

Remarks:

Do not delete DLLs that appear to be unused. Instead, move suspect DLLs to a directory not listed in the path statement. It's not possible for FDDLLS to show all needed DLLs as referenced. DLLs loaded at run time such as those used by Visual Basic programs will be incorrectly identified as orphans. Programs run from CD-ROM drives will also cause false positives. Yet another common situation is when you have drivers installed, such as those for sound cards or video cards or networks, which are not currently in use.
   If you delete a DLL which is needed by a program, you will have to reinstall that program. A much safer solution is to move DLLs that seem to be orphans to a separate subdirectory or to a floppy disk. DLLs should never be deleted.
