Many thanks to Dave Fetrow (mailto:fetrow@biostat.washington.edu)
for creating an archive of setup files. The archive is 
particularly oriented toward sets of applications that 
are somewhat tricky, such as combinations involving 
different driver sets, mixtures of NetWare, TCP/IP, 
and W4WG, etc. 

Please include not only the setup and configuration files
but some directions. Comments included with the setup files
are highly desirable. The files can include your name if you
desire. 

Please mail submissions to mailto:ftp@ftp.biostat.washington.edu.

--------------------- FAQ Begins Here ---------------------------

A. Components of a TCP/IP solution

A-1. What do I need to run TCP/IP on the PC?

To run TCP/IP on the PC you will need:

* Appropriate hardware, such as:

    Ethernet card
    Token Ring card
    AppleTalk card
    Serial Port
   

  Any other network card with a packet driver or NDIS or ODI driver,
  (such as Arcnet), will also work.  If your card supports NetBIOS,
  this is also acceptable, since you can run a packet-driver-over-
  NetBIOS shim.

* Drivers for your hardware.

  Your card probably came with one or more of the following drivers:
 
    Network Device Interface Specification (NDIS) drivers
      [spec. by 3Com and Microsoft, used by LAN Manager, Windows
      for Workgroups, and Windows NT. LAN Manager uses NDIS 2.0,
      Windows NT uses 3.0, and WFW supports 2.0 and will support 
      3.0]
    ODI Drivers [spec. by Novell, abbreviation for Open DataLink
      Interface]
    Packet Drivers [spec. by FTP Software]
   
  TCP/IP stacks have been written for each of these driver interfaces, 
  so the important thing is whether your chosen stack is compatible 
  with the interface available for your card.
 
  A shim is software that runs on top of one set of drivers to
  provide an interface equivalent to another set. This is useful,
  for example,if you are looking to run software requiring an
  NDIS driver(such as Chameleon NFS) alongside software
  requiring a packet driver interface (such as KA9Q, Gopher, Popmail,
  NCSA Telnet, etc.), or run software intended for, say, a packet
  driver over an NDIS driver instead.
 
  Shims are available to run packet drivers over NetBIOS, ODI,
  or NDIS, in order to run software expecting a packet driver over
  NDIS, ODI, or NetBIOS instead. There are also shims to run NDIS
  over ODI (ODINSUP), and ODI over Packet Drivers (PDETHER). 


* A TCP/IP protocol stack.

  The TCP/IP protocol stack runs on top of the driver software, and
  uses it to access your hardware. If you are running a TCP/IP
  protocol stack that requires drivers that aren't available for your
  hardware, you're in trouble. Check into this before purchasing!

  For DOS, in many cases a TCP/IP stack is built into the applications.
  This is true for a great many of the packet driver applications, including
  KA9Q, and the WATTCP applications. 
 

* If running Windows applications that require it, WINSOCK.DLL. 


  Windows Sockets is a sockets interface which was created as a 
  Windows DLL. Each  TCP/IP implementation requires its own version 
  of Windows Sockets. Trumpet Winsock and VxDTCP are the only
  two publicly distributable Windows Sockets implementations. 
  WINSOCK.DLL provides 16-bit support; WSOCK32.DLL provides 32-bit support. 

   
* Applications software.

  Although most of us in this newsgroup seem to spend our time
  looking for working combinations of applications,WINSOCK.DLLs,
  Windows Sockets compliant TCP/IP implementations, shims, 
  drivers, and hardware, ultimately your goal is eventually to 
  run an application successfully. If and when that happens, 
  please send me a note, so I can add it to this FAQ.


A-2. What are packet drivers?  Where do I get them?

Packet drivers provide a software interface that is independent of the  
interface card you are using, but NOT independent of the particular 
network technology. As Frances K. Selkirk (mailto:fks@vaxeline.ftp.com) notes:

"That's one reason they're easier to write than ODI drivers! If you
write a class three (802.5 Token Ring) driver, you will need to use
software that expects a class three driver, not software that expects
a class 1 (DIX ethernet) driver. There are a few drivers that fake class 1. 

I believe only class 1 and class 6 (SLIP) drivers are supported by 
freeware packages."

The chances are fair that your Ethernet card came with a packet
driver, and if so, you should try that first. If not, then you
can try one of the drivers from the Crynwr collection (formerly
called the Clarkson Drivers). See the Resource listing for info.

For 3COM drivers, try ftp://ftp.3com.com/pub For technical information,
try mailto:info@3com.com. For marketing and product info, try
mailto:leads@hq.3mail.3com.com.The packet driver specification is available
from ftp://vax.ftp.com/packet-d.ascii

The following vendors have packet drivers with source available for
their pocket lan adaptors:

D-Link - +1-714-455-1688
Solectek - +1-619-450-1220
Accton - +1-408-452-8900
Compulan - +1-408-922-6888
(soon Kodiak's Noteport - +1-408-441-6900)

You can obtain a complete library of packet drivers from many of the
Simtel20 mirror sites, including:
ftp://oak.oakland.edu/pub/msdos/pktdrvr/pktd11.zip, 
ftp://oak.oakland.edu/pub/msdos/pktdrvr/pktd11c.zip. 


A-3. What is Windows Sockets?  Where can I get it?

  The idea for Windows Sockets was born at Fall Interop '91, during a
  Birds of a Feather session.  

  From the Windows Sockets specification:
  [courtesy of Mark Towfiq, mailto:towfiq@Microdyne.COM]:
 

    The Windows Sockets Specification is intended to provide a
    single API to which application developers can program and
    multiple network software vendors can conform. Furthermore, in
    the context of a particular version of Microsoft Windows, it
    defines a binary interface (ABI) such that an application
    written to the Windows Sockets API can work with a conformant
    protocol implementation from any network software vendor.

Windows Sockets will be supported by Windows, Windows for Workgroups,
Win32s, and Windows NT. It will also support protocols other than TCP/IP.
Under Windows NT, Microsoft will provides Windows Sockets support over
TCP/IP and IPX/SPX. DEC will be implementing DECNet. Windows NT will 
include mechanisms for multiple protocol support in Windows Sockets, 
both 32-bit and 16-bit.

Mark Towfiq writes:

    "Files and information related to the Windows Sockets API are
     available via ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/micro/pc-stuff/ms-windows/winsock, 
     which is a mirror of ftp://microdyne.com/pub/winsock (SunSite has a much
     faster connection to the Internet, so you are advised to use
     that).

     If you do not have FTP access to the Internet, send a message
     with the word "help" in the body to either
     mailto:ftpmail@SunSite.UNC.Edu, or mailto:ftpmail@DECWRL.DEC.Com, to obtain
     information about the FTP to Mail service there."
 
  Alternative sources for the Windows Sockets specification include
  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/ (an FTP server running NT), as well as the
  Microsoft forum on CompuServe (go msl).
  
  Currently NetManage (NEWT), Distinct, Spry, FTP and Frontier are shipping
  Winsock TCP/IP stacks, as is Microsoft (Windows NT and TCP/IP for
  WFW), Beame & Whiteside Software (v1.1 compliant), and Sun PC-NFS. 
  If you are looking for a Winsock.dll, you should first contact your TCP/IP
  stack vendor. Novell has one in beta for their Lan Workplace for DOS.

A-4 What is Trumpet Winsock? How can I get it to dial? 

Peter Tattam has released a shareware Windows Sockets compliant
  TCP/IP stack. You can obtain it via    
  ftp://ftp.utas.edu.au/pc/trumpet/winsock/winsock.zip, 
  ftp://ftp.utas.edu.au/pc/trumpet/winsock/winapps.zip
  ftp://biochemistry.bioc.cwru.edu/pub/trumpwsk/winsock.zip.   
  ftp://biochemistry.bioc.cwru.edu/pub/trumpwsk/winapps.zip.   
  
The first thing to do after you download WINSOCK.ZIP is to create
a directory for Trumpet Winsock, such as C:/TRUMPWSK, and put it
in your DOS PATH statement. 

Trumpet Winsock operates over packet drivers, or over a serial port
using its own built-in SLIP/CSLIP and PPP. If you are using a network
adapter, this means that you will have to locate a packet driver
for your adapter, and load it. Trumpet Winsock also comes with 
WINPKT, and this is loaded next, via the command
WINPKT.COM 0x60 [or whatever the software interrupt for your packet driver]

You will then enter Windows, and create a group in the Program Manager
for all the files that come with Trumpet Winsock. The stack itself is loaded
by executing TCPMAN. Applications that come with it include WinCHAT, 
a chatting program; PINGW, a ping utility; FTPW for FTP, WINARCH for Archie. 

When you first execute TCPMAN, you will be asked to fill out the setup 
information for the stack. Select whether you will be using a network
adapter or SLIP; you cannot use both. 

Since Trumpet Winsock now supports PPP, you do not need to load an Ethernet
simulation drivers such as EtherPPP. 

If for some reason you don't like Trumpet Winsock's scripting language, 
you can use any other comm program that doesn't drop carrier on exit, or 
the DIALER program, available via: 

ftp://ftp.cica.indiana.edu/pub/pc/win3/util/dialexe.zip. 

You can also use EtherPPP (ftp://merit.edu/pub/ppp/pc/etherppp.zip) 
instead of Trumpet Winsock's built-in PPP. This is an Ethernet simulation driver, 
so you will configure Trumpet Winsock as though it were running over an Ethernet 
Packet driver, i.e. by loading WINPKT 0x60, and setting the packet driver
vector in TCPMAN to 0x60. 

EtherPPP comes with its own dialer, so you will need to create a dialing script.
If your TCP/IP address will be changing, you will also need to write a little
batch script to capture the assigned IP address, and insert it into Trumpet's
initialization file.  EtherPPP takes up too much RAM (121K), but otherwise
works fine.  

As for Trumpet Winsock's built-in scripting language, the default dialout
script is LOGIN.CMD. A sample LOGIN.CMD file from Geoff Cox 
(mailto:geoff@satro.demon.co.uk):

#

A-5. What publicly distributable TCP/IP applications are there for
     DOS?  Windows?

Right now there are a wealth of publicly distributable TCP/IP
applications running under DOS.  Windows also has a wealth of 
programs available, including implementations of Gopher, Mail
(POP3/SMTP), FSP, WWW, Telnet, FTP, IRC, and WAIS. 

See the Resource listings for information.


A-6. What software is available for doing SLIP?  Compressed SLIP?
     PPP?  For DOS?  For Windows?  For OS/2?

Trumpet Winsock now supports both PPP as well as SLIP/CSLIP. 

For SLIP or CSLIP use with DOS, I recommend using SLIPPER or CSLIPPER. 
These are packet drivers that can be used along with a dialer. For PPP, 
I recommend the EtherPPP packet driver described above.  

There is a special version of NCSA Telnet for PPP, available from
ftp://merit.edu/pub/ppp/pc. 

KA9Q supports SLIP/CSLIP as well as PPP, but unfortunately can not be used as a
TCP/IP protocol stack to run other apps.

I have heard good things about IBM's TCP/IP for OS/2, but haven't
used it msyelf. Please see the FAQ from news:comp.os.os2.networking for details.

IBM, FTP Software, Beame & Whiteside, Frontier, SPRY and Netmanage also 
offer SLIP support in their products. See the resource listings for details.  


A-7. What about the software included with various books?

The software included with various books (including mine) is usually
Chameleon Sampler from NetManage. Sampler supports SLIP/CSLIP/PPP, but
not connection over a network, and includes software for FTP, Telnet,
TN3270, and Mail. The stack included with Sampler (NEWT) is Winsock
compatible, so you can run any Windows Sockets-compatible application
over it. Installation is quite a bit simpler compared with going the
Trumpet Winsock route, so this is probably the best way to go assuming
that you are a dialup IP user.

However, be aware that Chameleon Sampler can cause problems if you
attempt to install it on a system that already has a version of TCP/IP,
such as one running Microsoft WFW TCP/IP-32. The installer does not
have an "applications only" option, which is unfortunate.  

Lately, some books are bundling Spyglass Mosaic. This is a good,
solid Mosaic implementation, but not as featureful or wizzy as
second generation browsers such as Netscape or BookLink. 

A-8. What diagnostic utilities are available to find problems with
my connection?  Where can I get them?

Frequently used diagnostic utilities include ifconfig (checks the
configuration of the network interfaces), ping (tests IP layer
connectivity), traceroute (traces the route that a packet takes
between two sites), netstat (checks the routing table), tcpdump
(protocol analyzer), arp (looks at the IP to Ethernet address
mappings). Microsoft TCP/IP-32 includes versions of all of these
except for tcpdump. 

KA9Q includes ifconfig, ping and traceroute functions. In KA9Q hop
check is the equivalent of traceroute. The Trumpet TCP/IP stack also
has a hopchk2 command that is a traceroute equivalent.

Etherload is very useful for network profiling, as well as packet 
analysis. Although it can't understand RARP or DHCP, it does
handle multiple protocols (AppleTalk, IP, IPX/SPX, NetBEUI),
lots of IP protocols (ARP, BOOTP, DNS, RIP, TFTP, TCP and UDP
statistics, Telnet, FTP). It even can handle NetBIOS traffic,
which UNIX tcpdump can't. One weakness is that it doesn't do
RARP or DHCP. 

The other major diagnostic utility I use is tcpdump, running
under UNIX. However, this is a TCP/IP only diagnostic tool,
can't be used with Netware, and doesn't know diddly about
NetBIOS. 

While Etherdump can be used for packet catching, I wish it would 
do more of the work for you, along the lines of TCPDUMP. Life's too
short to spend looking at hex packet traces, so I use EtherLoad
or tcpdump instead.  

Trumpet Winsock comes with Windows implementations of Ping and Traceroute. 

A-9. Is there a CD-ROM with the software included in this FAQ?

The Packet Driver, WinSock & TCP/IP CD-ROM is available from
CDPublishing for $29.95. This includes the packet drivers of course,
but also lots of other DOS and Windows TCP/IP stuff, including
Windows Sockets applications. It also includes the text of all
the RFCs. This is now somewhat out of date (it was cut in
December 1993), but is otherwise highly recommended. 

CDPublishing, (604)874-1430, (800)333-7565, fax: (604)874-1431,

A-10. Does Windows NT support SLIP? PPP? 

The Windows NT 3.5 supports PPP (client and server) and SLIP (client), 
both including support for Van Jacobson header compression. It also
supports DHCP, and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). 

A-11. Where can I get Microsoft TCP/IP-32? 

Microsoft has now released a 32-bit TCP/IP stack for  
Windows for Workgroups v3.11. It's easy to set up,
fast, and has worked fine for me. It supports a host of very
nice new features, including DHCP automatic configuration, WINS
name resolution, and Windows Sockets v1.1. In addition it comes
with Telnet and FTP applications. However, please note that
it does not offer SLIP or PPP support. 
The final release is now available via:
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/peropsys/windows/Public/tcpip/


A-12. How do I get my BBS to run over TCP/IP? 

First off, let's clarify what we mean by "over TCP/IP." This can mean
everything from "accessible via Telnet" to being a full Internet
citizen, supporting Gopher, HTML, etc.

NovaLink Professional is today the only BBS software that includes
support for HTML in mail and news. For info, contact Res Nova
Software. Softarc's FirstClass package will soon be availble on Windows NT,
and has also promised HTML support. 

eSoft's IPAD is a full fledged SMTP, NNTP, DNS, FTP, Telnet, and SLIP/PPP
server, that can be hooked up to an existing TBBS system to provide
full Internet support. It comes with hardware and costs in the neighborhood
of $4K. 

The Major BBS now runs under UNIX, and thus offers Internet support;
the DOS version now has an Internet gateway that can handle telnet,
mail, and news, among other things. 

Support for a variety of BBSes is available from Murkworks. Their
BBSNet product provides a Telnet interface that looks like a FOSSIL driver.  
The first version runs partly as an NLM; some of the code resides on the server.
For info, contact 

BBSnet,MurkWorks, Inc., P.O. Box 631,Potsdam, NY 13676, 
+1 315 265 4717, mailto:info@MurkWorks.com

For further information on running BBSes on the Internet, see The
Online User's Encyclopedia, Addison-Wesley. 

A-13. Are there graphical servers out there?

Yes! For Windows there is a graphical SMTP daemon which is not very
functional (it can't do as much as KA9Q); several Web servers, including
a Windows version of NCSA's HTTP, and SerWeb. 

For Windows NT, The European Microsoft Windows Academic Consortium (EMWAC) has
released Windows NT servers for Gopher, WAIS, and WWW. These servers
are easy to install, and fast, and offer the full complement of capabilities,
including support for forms, access to WAIS indices from within HTTPS, 
installation as a Windows NT service, etc. Highly recommended. 

See the resource section for details.

A-14. What methods of address assignment are available?

Methods of address assignment include client/server protocols
(RARP, BOOTP, DHCP), as well as script-based methods 
(terminal server indicates, "your address is 192.187.147.2"). PPP
also supports assignment of addresses from the server. 

As part 2 of this FAQ discusses, there are RARP and BOOTP clients
and servers available for DOS. Typically the clients work by stashing
the IP address in a DOS environmental variable. It is then your responsibility 
to modify the appropriate config files to reflect this 
address. This can be done using a DOS batch script and a utility such as 
DOS awk. This same approach can be used to modify config files when using
EtherPPP; this does not place the IP address into a variable, but the output
of EtherPPP can be piped to a file and the IP address picked off and inserted 
in the appropriate locations. If this sounds complicated, it is; be warned.

Trumpet Winsock supports script-based assignment of addresses. Microsoft TCP/IP
supports a DHCP client and NT Server supports a DHCP server. 
There is also a forthcoming DHCP server for Sun. 

However, be aware that these products are not always RFC compliant. For example,
RFC covers interoperability between BOOTP and DHCP. This
RFC states states how a DHCP client can use a BOOTP server to determine its
parameters, and how a BOOTP client can interoperate with a DHCP server. 
However, I am not aware of a DHCP client or server that implements these
recommendations. 

A-15. How can I set up PPP server on a UNIX host? 

This is not the appropriate place to address that question, but lots
of info on this is available in the news:comp.protocols.ppp FAQ. 

A-16. What is WinSNMP? Why doesn't my TCP/IP stack support SNMP? 

WinSNMP is an API which provides a standard interface to to the
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for network
management applications running under Windows. Applications written to 
WinSNMP can run on any WinSNMP-compatible implementation. 

Vendors supporting WinSNMP include FTP Software, which supports it
in both OnNet 1.1, and PC/TCP 3.0. SNMP agents are also available
in Windows NT, Chameleon, and other packages. 

There are also freeware WinSNMP-compliant applications. See the 
Resource Section for details. 

However, if your chosen TCP/IP stack does not support an SNMP agent,
you are probably out of luck. This is because SNMP support cannot just
be tacked on; the stack must keep the statistics, and work closely
with the SNMP agent in order to allow these variables to be read
in response to SNMP queries. Without detailed knowledge of a particular
stack's operation, it is virtually impossible to write an SNMP agent
for it. 

A-17. What proxy servers are available for use with Web browsers? 

Mosaic and WinWeb now both support proxies via the CERN httpd, which
supports http, ftp, gopher, and wais proxies, as well as caching. 
Netscape supports the SOCKS proxy. 

A-18. Why doesn't my Web browser support direct WAIS queries?

If you've been trying out WinWeb, Netscape, Booklink, Windows Mosaic, 
or Cello, you've noticed that trying to resolve a WAIS URL results
in an error. You may have checked your URL syntax over and over,
trying to figure out what you did wrong. 

Guess what? The only Web browser that supports direct WAIS queries
is XMosaic v2.4 or later. On that browser, a WAIS query will generate
a request to port 210 on the destination WAIS site. (I know, because
I've run TCPDUMP to verify this).

On other browsers, you can reach WAIS sites that have set up a
Gopher or Web server to handle queries; however, you cannot
reach them directly. 

How did this come about? Windows Mosaic v1.0 contained 
support for a WAIS gateway operating at NCSA. This gateway took 
your incoming request, and forwarded it to the destination WAIS site, 
and when the response came back, forwarded the answer to you. However,
the NCSA WAIS gateway got bogged down, so support for WAIS gatewaying
was removed in v2.0. However, since they didn't put direct WAIS
support in, an error was generated.

In my opinion, this was (and is) handled lamely. Either put up a 
reasonable error message explaining that WAIS is not supported,
or put in direct support.

A-19. What is SOCKS? What TCP/IP stacks and applications support it?

SOCKS is a type of proxy server that listens on port 1080. Instead
of sending HTTP requests to port 80, gopher to port 70, etc. a
SOCKS-compliant application will instead route them to port 1080 on the
SOCKS server. The SOCKS server then examines the requests and decides
if they should be allowed or denied. 

To my knowledge, Trumpet Winsock v2.0 is the only TCP/IP stack with
built-in SOCKS support. It apparently has problems with rbind, which
can get gotten around by using FTP in PASV mode. 

Netscape also supports SOCKS. 

A-20. How can I handle authentication on my NNTP server?

A good way to handle this is to use the AUTHINFO extensions to NNTP
which are supported by the INN server, as well as clients supporting
AUTHINFO, such as WinVN, the Trumpet newsreader (DOS and Windows versions), 
and Internews on the Macintosh. With AUTHINFO, you can automatically 
allow hosts within a known subdomain to post without authentication, 
forcing users outside this domain to input their userID and password, 
which is the same as that needed to access a POP server running on the 
same machine. With AUTHINFO, the userID is automatically placed in the posting. 

A-21. What is SlipKnot? 

SlipKnot (TM) is a shareware Web browser for MS Windows that works with ordinary UNIX
shell accounts, without requiring a SLIP or PPP connection. SlipKnot provides
a UNIX shell terminal window so that you can still use your ordinary UNIX
commands, or you can switch into Web browser mode. With SlipKnot, up to
five documents can be visible at a time; previous requests are cached. Since
SlipKnot supports threading, you can look at an existing document while a 
new one is being retrieved. SlipKnot supports saving or printing of documents, 
including embedded images. 

SlipKnot requires a mouse, Windows 3.1 or WFW with 2 MB disk space, 4 MB of memory, 
with 8 MB recommended. On the UNIX side, you will need Xmodem or Ymodem support. 

See the resource section for details. 

A-22. What is TwinSock?

TwinSock is a freeware Winsock proxy client implementation. When using
TwinSock, you need not assign an official IP address. When a Windows
application makes a Windows Sockets call, the TwinSock client passes
the request to a version of TwinSock running on the firewall host. The
firewall host will then permit or deny the request, and will pass the response
to through to the requesting client. 

For more information on TwinSock, check out news:alt.dcomp.slip-emulators,
news:comp.os.ms-windows.networking.tcp-ip, news:comp.os.ms-windows.apps.comm

A-23. How do I get info on the ODI specification? 

Try:
ftp://netlab2.usu.edu/odi

A-24. What is WinISDN?

Ed Klingman (mailto:klingman@interramp.com) writes:

The WinISDN API is an open standard. It was created by
NetManage, ISDN*tek and Performance Systems. Inc (PSI)
to support PPP packets to the Internet, peer-to-peer
connectivity, and Voice applications over ISDN. It is NOT
a proprietary standard, no royalties are associated with it. 

WinISDN is packet-based and (for simple connectivity) requires
NO knowledge of ISDN protocols. This is probably its main
advantage over CAPI and TAPI, both of which tend to
require ISDN protocol knowledge to do the simplest connection.
Of course, ISDN protocol support is there for advanced applications. 

WinISDN provides very simple connections over ISDN networks and
supports HDLC PPP packets on B-channels, Voice, and streaming data
transfer as well as X.25 packets on the D-channel. It runs on
Windows 3.1 systems and has run under Windows 95 beta. It works
well under IBM's Win/OS2 software.

WinISDN is supported by the following hardware providers:

	ISDN*tek	- available
	IBM		- announced
	3COM		- not officially announced
	AccessWorks	- not officially announced
	Motorola	- not officially announced
	Teles		- not officially announced
	others		- working on it

WinISDN is supported by the following TCP-IP software vendors:

	NetManage	- available
	Spry		- Q2 - not officially announced
	Wollongong	- Q2 - not officially announced
	FTP		- Q3 - not officially announced
	Frontier	- ??

Internet Access using WinISDN is available in:

	US	- all ISDN switches: AT&T 5ESS, DMS-100, Siemens
	Japan	- NTT INS-64
	Israel	- Bezeq ISDN
	Europe	- Q2 or Q3, 1995

The WinISDN API can be downloaded (as a Word 2.0 doc) from:
ftp://ftp.netmanage.com/pub/win_standards/winisdn/winisdn9.doc

The market did not "agree" to this standard. It became a standard
by providing the first PC-card ISDN acess to the Internet in the US.
Its simplicity, robustness, and open-ness, caused it to be adopted
by the above players, among others. It was designed to allow
mapping from CAPI and TAPI into WinISDN.

ISDN*tek will be announcing a Visual Basic WinISDN Developers kit
at the Software Developers Conference in Feb and VBITs in March.


B. Questions about drivers

B-1. What do I need to know before setting up SLIP or PPP?

Before setting up your SLIP or PPP connection, you should
have available the following information:

* The domain name and TCP/IP address of your host.
* Whether your TCP/IP address will be assigned statically,
  dynamically, or from the server.
* If from the server, whether you will be using RARP, BOOTP or DHCP. 
* The domain name and TCP/IP address of your machine (if you are not
  configuring the address dynamically or via BOOTP)
* The domain name and TCP/IP address of the primary and secondary
  Domain Name Server.
* The subnet mask.
* The domain name and TCP/IP address of an NNTP server.
* Whether your host supports POP, and if so, what version.
* Whether the host supports compressed or uncompressed SLIP, or PPP.
* The size of the Maximum Receivable Unit (MRU). 


Do not attempt to connect to your host before you have this
information, since it will just waste your time and money, and may
cause problems for the network.  In particular, do not attempt to
initiate a connection using a made up TCP/IP address! It is possible
that your madF-up address may conflict with an existing address.  

This is probably the quickest way to get people very angry at you.

Static addressing means that your TCP/IP address will always
be the same. This makes it easy to configure your setup files.
Dynamic addressing means that the host will send you a message
containing your TCP/IP address when you log on. This can be
problematic if your software doesn't support grabbing the address
and inserting it into the setup files. If not, then you may have
to edit your setup files every time you log on. Yuck!

Chameleon includes a version of SLIP which can handle dynamic
addressing. The most recent version of Novell's Lan Workplace for
DOS does as well. 

You can also retrieve your address using RARP, BOOTP or DHCP. RARP
is only available to those on the same LAN as the RARP server, since
it uses broadcasting. BOOTP clients can access BOOTP servers on other
LANs via BOOTP relay. DHCP is a BOOTP extension, which allows
complete configuration of a client from info stored on a DHCP server, and in
addition supports new concepts such as "address leases". Since
DHCP frames are very similar to BOOTP frames, devices supporting BOOTP relay 
will also support DHCP relay. 

Of course, for DHCP or BOOTP to work, you will need to set up a DHCP
or BOOTP server. DHCP servers are available for UNIX, and Windows NT;
BOOTP servers are available for UNIX (BOOTPD, from CMU).

PPP also supports server assignment of TCP/IP addresses.


B-2. How do I configure SLIPDIAL?


From Ashok Aiyar, mailto:ashok@biochemistry.bioc.cwru.edu:

PHONE Script Files:

PHONE comes with several scripts (for various modems) and for the
University of Minnesota Terminal server built into it.  The command
PHONE WRITE writes these scripts to an ASCII file called PHONE.CMD,
which can be edited to your needs (modem and slip server)

The documentation that accompanies PHONE, provides good instructions on
writing script files to get PHONE to dial SLIP servers other than
the University of Minnesota server.  For example here is a script
that I use to dial a CISCO server at the University that I attend.

Background:  To start a SLIP connection, I dial our terminal server,
and login with a username and password.  After doing so, I start a SLIP
session with the following command "slip usernamF-slip.dialin.cwru.edu",
followed by my password -- again.

Here then is the relevant portion of the PHONE.CMD script file -

How to use packet drivers other than UMSLIP with PHONE?

The quick answer -- there is no "clean" way.  Below is a batch file
hack that I wrote to use PHONE with other packet drivers.  In this
example, the packet driver is Peter Tattam's CSLIPPER.  To use a
batch file like this, you must know the parameters with which you
plan to use the packet driver -- i.e interrupt vector, baud rate,
port address, and IRQ.  This batch file requires UMSLIP.COM,
CSLIPPER.EXE, and TERMIN.COM to be in the same directory
or in your path ...

All that the BATCH file does is to let you dial the SLIP connection
using PHONE, load the appropriate packet driver, hangup the
connection, and unload the driver when you are done ...

B-3. How do I install packet drivers for Windows applications?

The secret is to load the packet driver, then run Windows. If you
are running Trumpet Winsock, you will also have to load WINPKT
before running Windows, as follows:

winpkt 0x60

If you are running DOS applications within a virtual DOS session
under Windows, you should load PKTMUX after your packet driver, as
follows:

PKTMUX 4 [or however many sessions you want]
WIN [load windows]
 
Then within each DOS session, load PKTDRV, the virtual packet driver.

If you are running Trumpet Winsock along with other DOS apps in a 
virtual DOS session, then you will need to load PKTDRV prior to
loading Windows, and then load WINPKT on top of it, as follows:

PKTMUX 4
PKTDRV 0x62
WINPKT 0x62
PKTDRV 0x60
WIN

TCPMAN will then find the virtual packet driver at 0x62. 


B-4. When do I need to install  WINPKT? 

You only need to load WINPKT before Windows if you have a network
card in  your computer, or are running a packet driver that simulates 
such a card, such as EtherPPP, or CSLIPPER in Ethernet simulation mode. 
If you are using Trumpet Winsock via SLIP/CSLIP, there is no need to load
WINPKT, since you can use Trumpet Winsock's built-in CSLIP driver. 

PKTMUX and WINPKT both accomplish the same thing: allowing you to
connect to a DOS packet driver running in real mode from a virtual
DOS session under Windows. PKTMUX is useful when you are running
more than one TCP/IP stack, and since it takes up more RAM and is
slower than WINPKT, you should only use it when you want to run more
than one stack at a time. If you are running only one DOS app,
or are using Trumpet Winsock, stick with WINPKT. 

James Harvey (mailto:harvey@iupui.edu) notes:
Winpkt is only useful running DOS applications with built-in TCP/IP
stacks under Windows, and for some Windows-based stacks (like the
Trumpet winsock.dll).  When an application registers with a packet
driver TSR to receive packets of a specified protocol type, one of the
things it hasto pass as a parameter to the packet driver in the call
is the address of a routine in the application that the packet driver
is to call when it has a packet to pass back to the application.  In
the case of an application running in 386 enhanced mode in a DOS shell
under Windows that is using a packet driver loaded in real mode before
Windows was loaded, the packet driver must ensure that Windows has the
application in memory when it does the callback, otherwise the callback
jumps off into space and your system locks up.  Winpkt does a Windows
system call to force the app into memory before the callback is done.

Erick Engelke (mailto:erick@uwaterloo.ca) notes:
Windows in enhanced mode uses the protected mode of the
386 CPU to create multiple virtual machines.  Winpkt tells
Windows to switch to the correct virtual machine before
trying to pass up the packet.  This reduces the chances of
Windows crashing.


B-5. How to do I run both WinQVT and ODI?

My advice is to use the Windows Sockets version of WinQVT/Net, Trumpet
Winsock, and ODIPKT. ODIPKT will allow you to run packet driver software
over ODI. You will also need to load WINPKT for Trumpet Winsock. 

The loading sequence is:

LSL [Link support layer]
NE2000.COM [or other ODI driver]
IPXODI [IPX version supporting ODI]
NETX
ODIPKT 1 96
WINPKT 0x60
WIN [run windows]

Then run Trumpet Winsock, and load WinQVT/Net. 

B-6. Is it possible to use BOOTP over SLIP?

Yes, but it is easier to use dynamic address assignment to get 
your IP address. This is where the SLIP server outputs your IP address 
before switching to SLIP. 

If you need BOOTP, then you should run a BOOTP server on the SLIP
server so that it can tell which SLIP connection originated the
request. Of course, the BOOTP server will ignore the hardware address
of the request originator, but instead will keep track of the SLIP
interface the request came in on. See the question on adding BOOTP to
KA9Q for info on how to handle this on the PC. Under UNIX, you may
have to add BOOTP capability to your slip driver, and rebuild the
kernel. (Not recommended for the squimish). 


B-7. How do SLIP drivers work? 

Some TCP/IP applications are written to only support Class 1 (Ethernet)
packet drivers, but do not support Class 6 (SLIP). For these applications, you
need software to make the application think it is dealing with a class 1
interface. This is done by adding fake ethernet headers to incoming 
SLIP or PPP packets and stripping the headers off outgoing packets. 


B-8. When do I need to install PKTMUX?

PKTMUX is needed to allow you to use more than one TCP/IP stack at the same 
time. This is useful if you have applications that require different stacks. 
Note that you do not need PKTMUX to run different protocols, since packet 
drivers only look at packets in the protocol they're designed to handle, 
and therefore you can use more than one of these at a time without conflict. 
You also don't need PKTMUX if all your applications use the same TCP/IP stack. 

PKTMUX works by looking at outgoing datagrams, and caching information on 
source and destination ports and addresses. Using this information, PKTMUX
tries to sort incoming datagrams by TCP/IP stack. If it can't figure out
which stack to send a datagram to (as might be the case if you were running
a server application on a well-known port, and had not sent any outgoing
packets yet), PKTMUX will send the datagram to all stacks. If all stacks
do not complain about the datagram, PKTMUX will throw away the ensuing outgoing
ICMP error message, assuming that one of the stacks correctly received
the datagram. If all stacks complain, it will send a single ICMP message
and throw the rest away.

While PKTMUX does its job very well, there are some situations that it cannot
handle, such as port conflicts. If two applications open the same TCP port,
chaos is inevitable, and there is little that PKTMUX can do to help. 

B-9. Can NDIS be used underneath multiple protocol stacks of the same type?
No. There is no equivalent to PKTMUX for NDIS.  

B-10. Is there an NDIS over packet driver shim? 
Joe Doupnik writes:

"No. Packet Drivers work by having an application register
for a particular packet TYPE, such as 0800 for IP. NDIS works much
differently, by offering a peekahead of every packet to applications in turn,
a polling operation. The only way NDIS could gracefully sit on a PD would
be to run the Packet Driver in all-types mode and let NDIS see all pkts
not used by other clients. Needless to say, that's an undesirable situation.
The quick solution, costing about US$100 (at least at my place,
more at yours) is a second Ethernet board in the client together with a
second IP address (most important, please)."

B-11. How do I run NetBIOS over TCP/IP? 

NetBIOS over TCP/IP is discussed in RFCs 1001 and 1002, which defines
three types of NetBIOS nodes:  

* B nodes, which use UDP broadcast packets to distribute datagrams and
resolve names. 
* P nodes, which use point-to-point communications and which 
require NetBIOS Datagram Distribution (NBDD) and NetBIOS Name 
Servers (NBNS). P nodes do not listen to or use broadcast 
services, so they cannot be used alongside B nodes. Unfortunately NBNS, 
and NBDD servers were not widely implemented, and those
that do exist (such as an implementation from Network Telesystems) 
are not inexpensive.  
* M nodes, which use both point-to-point and broadcast. 

B node technology cannot be used on an IP internet without extensions, 
since UDP broadcast packets are not forwarded through routers. This 
is not a problem with use of NetBIOS over IPX/SPX, since in IPX/SPX 
broadcast packets can be forwarded. 

However, until very recently, M and P node technology was not supported 
by popular TCP/IP implementations. For example, PC/TCP supports
B node technology with extensions such as a broadcast file, host file, 
or DNS resolution of NetBIOS names. Windows NT and WFW TCP/IP uses an 
LMHOSTS file for resolving names. 

According to Chip Sparling of FTP Software:

"From what I remember from our discussions of a few years ago, P
nodes were only implemented by Ungermann Bass and 3COM (and they 
required you to use a NetBIOS name resolver which was non-rfc 1001, 1002 compliant), 
nobody did M nodes (as far as I remember) and PC-LAN, Lantastic and
LanManager used B node.  Also, if you did a P or M node it wouldn't be
compatible with a B node NetBIOS.  We decided that we could give the
compatibility and functionality (routability) with a B node plus
extensions implementation.  So, that's what we did." 

Without implementation of M and P node technology, the only way 
to run over an IP internet is to to implement B node technology 
with extensions, as FTP Software does in PC/TCP. According to Chip, 
"one way to handle large numbers of hosts on multiple networks is 
to use the broadcast file extenstion.  Instead of putting specific 
ip addresses in the broadcast file, use a subnet broadcast address 
like nnn.nnn.nnn.255. which will cover an entire subnet."

Assuming you don't need any of the extensions to RFC NetBIOS 
Microsoft created to make NetBIOS work smoothly in a routed environment 
(available only in their IP stack), you can choose from a wide variety of
commercial vendors. For example, FTP Software's PC/TCP includes RFC NetBIOS 
support; Performance Technologies has a NetBIOS that runs over packet drivers,
as does Accton (LANSoft). 

If any other vendors are reading this, I'd love to have information 
on how *you* implement NetBIOS over TCP/IP, and whether you'll be
supporting WINS, the new P-node technology name resolution service
from Microsoft. 

WINS support is included in the recent release of TCP-IP/32 which
is available for download on ftp.microsoft.com. Consult the 
release documentation for more information on this. 

Another recent development is the release of an NBNS and SMB
server for UNIX, known as Samba. Samba works great, I am using
it. See resource section for details. 


B-12. How do I run NFS along with another TCP/IP application?

The DOS NFS implementation by M. Durkin now supports a built-in
packet multiplexer that can handle NFS plus another stack loaded
simultaneously. If you need to load more stacks, then you will need
to run PKTMUX as well.

See the resource section for details. 

B-13. How do I run Trumpet Winsock along with KA9Q or NFS? 

The secret is to load WINPKT on top of the PKTDRV virtual
packet driver, if you are running PKTMUX. 

B-14. I am trying to run Netware and TCP/IP at the same time, using
      PDETHER. How do I do this?

Chris Badura (bad@flatlin.ka.sub.org ) writes:
"On one PC running odipkt over the ODI driver for the pocket ethernet
adaptor resulted in a 10x performance *decrease*.  So I switched to
running IPX/SPX over a paket driver for this adaptor wich performs
very well. The setup is like:

	pkdriver 0x60
	lsl
	pdether
	ipxodi
	netx
	winpkt 0x60

I had to get pde103.zip from netlab2.usu.edu to get IPX with Ethernet
II frameing to work.  The older pdether from simtel didn't work.
It seems also like winpkt has to be loaded last."

B-15. Sample Stick Diagrams

It has been proposed that we begin to collect some diagrams of working
combinations of hardware, drivers, shims, stacks, and applications. I'm
game, and have made a start below. If you've got some other exotic
configuration that works (or if you've tried one of the configurations below
and discovered it doesn't work, drop me a line).

NOTES:

Win/QVTNet must be loaded as the very first Windows application and must be 
kept operating as long as your are in Windows.  It appears that its TCP/IP 
stack does some strange things when it disconnects and kills access to the 
actual packet driver.

I run PC gopher and POPMail alternatively, so they share one channel which 
is allocated via PKTDRV before running the application and deallocated 
after the application is finished (I usually throw in a reset command to 
PMTMUX as well just to be safe).

To explain what is happening (as best I can since a lot of this came from 
experimentation):

1.  The packet driver is loaded
2.  PKTMUX is run over the packet driver in order to multiplex it (in this 
    case three channels).
3.  A virtual packet driver is loaded for Win/QVTNet on interrupt 65 and 
    the packet driver is told that it is not to listen for any server 
    requests.
4.  PKINT is loaded over top of the virtual packet driver
5.  Start Windows and run Win/QVTNet as the first application, it must be 
    kept running throughout the Windows session.
6.  Load a virtual packet driver from a DOS session and start KA9Q.  I use 
    the following batch file to do this:

         c:\network\pktdrv 63 /l
         h:
         cd \
         net091b
         c:\network\pktdrv 63 /uu
         c:\network\pktmux /r

7.  Load a virtual packet driver and run PC Gopher or POPMail as needed.  I 
    use the following batch files for PC Gopher and POPMail respectively:

         c:\network\pktdrv 63
         h:\goph-cli\gopher /T=h:\goph-cli\text /X=h:\goph-cli\binary
         c:\network\pktdrv 63 /uu


         c:\network\pktdrv 66 /c
         h:\popmail\popmail /noems
         c:\network\pktdrv 66 /uu

8.  The only problem seems to be that the NNTP module in Win/QVTNet will 
    not operate correctly if POPMail is operating.  Otheriwse it seems to 
    work okay without too many problems.

C. KA9Q Questions

C-1. What version of KA9Q should I use and where do I get it?

There are so many releases of KA9Q that it is a significant amount of
work just to keep track of them all. This has occurred partly because
KA9Q does not support extended or expanded memory, and therefore many
people have needed to customize it with the features relevant to them
in order to allow it to do what they want as well as fit into memory. 
The primary difference among the various releases is whether they 
include code for a BBS, packet radio support (AX.25), synchronous cards (for
use with leased lines), NNTP, CSO or Gopher servers, packet filtering, DNS,
BOOTP, RIP or PPP support. 

The three primary KA9Q releases at this time are those managed by Ashok Aiyar
(ashok@biochemistry.bioc.cwru.edu), those put out by Demon Internet
Services (DIS), and the JNOS distribution. JNOS is the primary packet radio-
oriented release; the other two major releases do not include AX.25 support.
Since JNOS does not include several features important to non-packet radio
users (DNS/Gopher/CSO server,hop check), try one of the other two releases
if you're not interested in packet radio.

Ashok's release is based on the N1BEE 0.85-beta which in turn 
is based on PA9GRI 2.0m NOS. Version 11c includes support for NTP, CSO,
gopher, FTP, FINGER, HTTP and SMTP/POP2/POP3 servers, plus VT102 and packet 
filtering support. Please not that this release does *not* include radio or 
synchronous card support, unlike the standard KA9Q release, and only supports 
SLIP/CSLIP. Also, there is no DNS server support, and the tip command has been 
removed, so that you need to use an external dialer to make the connection. It
does however support BOOTP, and comes with a good manual which is fairly current
(June 1994). 

Available as:

ftp://biochemistry.bioc.cwru.edu/pub/nos/nos11c.exe, 
ftp://biochemistry.bioc.cwru.edu/pub/nos/nos11c.txt,

ftp://biochemistry.bioc.cwru.edu/pub/nos/filter.txt, 
ftp://biochemistry.bioc.cwru.edu/pub/nos/autoexec.nos

The TextWin version from Demon Internet Services includes support for 
DNS server, packet filtering, FTP, SMTP/POP2/POP3 servers, NNTP server, 
VT102 support, NTP, BBS, PPP, demand dial, ping, hop check 
(traceroute equivalent). I am using it now on my own LAN, it is great.
However, SLIP/CSLIP support is no longer compiled in by default;
you'll have to compile a custom version to get this. 

From mailto:mike@childsoc.demon.co.uk (Michael Bernardi):

"Demon Internet Services have a dialin Internet service in the UK.
They also support a customised version of KA9Q optimised for
dialup, they also support the PCElm mailer, SNEWS news reader and
a customised front end. There is also a combined NEWS and MAIL
program called CPPNEWS and an alternative MAIL program called
VIEW, these last are unsupported by mailto:Internet@demon.co.uk but other
DIS users do support them. All these programs can be found on
ftp://ftp.demon.co.uk/pub/ibmpc/ and are written to
work with KA9Q (specifically the DIS version)."

Anthony McCarthy has added a multi-windowing system to KA9Q that 
supports the mouse, which has been recommended. See Resource 
listings for info. 

The DIS release includes three versions, small, medium and large. 
The large version includes everything but the kitchen sink, including
an NNTP server. I also believe it includes the KA9Q BBS code, and
radio support. 

Editorial: To my mind, the time has come for the major releases to combine 
their code bases and produce a version with the best features of all of them. 
To my mind, the ideal KA9Q release would be a release combining the improved 
server support of the CWRU release with the working PPP implementation, demand 
dial, packet filter and DNS server support of the DIS version.  


C-2. What do I need to run KA9Q? Why won't it do VT-100 emulation?

KA9Q is usually run from a startup script, such as my script
startnos.bat:

\nos\drivers\8003pkdr
\nos\net -d \nos

Here I first load the packet drivers for my 8003 Ethernet card, then
run KA9Q (known as net.exe).

The KA9Q package then reads commands from a configuration file, called
AUTOEXEC.NOS in some implementations, AUTOEXEC.NET in others. 

For VT100 emulation with KA9Q, try using Giles Todd's VT102.COM,
available via ftp://ftp.demon.co.uk/pub/ibmpc/DIS.

C-3. How do I configure KA9Q as a SLIP dialup connection?

Here is a sample CSLIP only configuration file which will run
on the DIS version with CSLIP/SLIP compiled in:

After executing this setup file, you should hear the modem dial out
to your SLIP host. Assuming that the dialing script is correct,
it should login and go into SLIP mode.

Type RESET at the prompt. This kills any residual processes that
may be operating.  

At this point you should have a functioning connection. You might
try to ping your host via the command:
PING <host adddress>
If this works, you will then see the round trip time to your host,
in milliseconds. 

Other possible diagnostic commands:

ASYSTAT <interface>	Gives statistics on packets received, sent, etc.
                        Very useful, particularly if you need to know if
                        you should install a 16550 on your serial port.
TRACE <interface> 1011	Shows incoming characters
RIP TRACE 1		Traces RIP packets
HOP CHECK <address>	Traces the route to the designated system. Useful 
			for figuring out routing problems. 


C-4. How do I configure KA9Q as a router?

I know have KA9Q up and running as a dial-on-demand router, using
an old 386 with only 1 Mb RAM. Boy, is this great! The TextWin version 
supports packet filtering, DNS server, FTP server, dial-on-demand, and PPP.
These capabilities put Textwin KA9Q head and shoulders above PCROUTE, 
in my humble opinion. About the only reason to use PCROUTE is if you
have an old 286 with just a floppy drive, but even then I'd urge
you to go out and get a 386/16 for $300, just so you could implement
packet filtering and be more secure.   

The KA9Q configuration that follows uses two interfaces, one a PPP
interface (pp0), the other an Ethernet interface (lan). Here I
am implementing dial on demand, and can also be doing packet 
filtering, and DNS serving on the same box. 

Please note the strange interrupt settings (Interrupt 5, port is COM3).  One of 
the nice things about KA9Q is that it is flexible enough to deal with 
such situations.

Here is a sample router configuration file for demand dial PPP:

# This config file is for use with the large TextWin 
# version of KA9Q available from ftp.demon.co.uk
#
# Set the host name
#
hostname gate.foobar.com
#
# Configure COM3 on Interrupt 5, at 38400 bps with 
# RTS/CTS (c) and PPP
# 
attach asy 0x3e8 5 ppp pp0 8092 576 38400 c
ifconfig pp0 ipaddress [192.187.147.2] 
ifconfig pp0 netmask 255.255.255.0
dialer pp0 dialer.ppp demand
#
ppp pp0 trace 2
ppp pp0 quick
ppp pp0 lcp open
ppp pp0 ipcp open
#
# Packet driver installed at software interrupt 
# number 0x60.
#
attach packet 0x60 lan 2 1500
ifconfig lan ipaddress [192.187.157.4] 
ifconfig lan netmask 255.255.255.0
#
route add default pp0
#
# The local Ethernet has a Class C network address so
# route all IP addresses beginning with 192.187.157 to 
# it.
route add 192.187.157/24 lan
#
# if you had the default route instead going through
# 192.187.157.4, you'd put in this statement:
# route add default lan 192.187.157.4
# and take out the route add default pp0 statement
#

You might try to use an on-demand dial router as a secondary DNS
server, like this:

named.boo file:

secondary foobar.com 192.187.157.7 foobar.com
secondary 157.187.192.in-addr.arpa 192.187.157.7 157.rev

However, this will not work, because the DNS timeout is shorter
than the average time to get KA9Q connected. As a result, KA9Q will
try to download the zone files before the link is fully up, and will
fail. However, you can act as a secondary on an ethernet network
just fine.

C-5  How do I get KA9Q to support BOOTP?

The CWRU NOS version has a working BOOTP client and server built-in,
and is the best version if you are looking for BOOTP support.
[Does Textwin offer full BOOTP support?]
If you are using another version of KA9Q that does not support BOOTP,
try the following: 

Steven L. Johnson (mailto:johnson@TIGGER.JVNC.NET) notes:

  KA9Q does have a bootp client but it is not compiled in by default.
  It has a bug that truncates the returned ip address to 16 bits
  which must be corrected before it will work.  It also complains
  about bootp servers that only support RFC 951 bootp without RFC
  1084 (or 1048) vendor extensions.  Other than that it seems to work
  for me.

  To enable the bootp client, add the following line to config.h:

    #define BOOTP 1

  To correct the ip address truncation problem, in bootp.c change:

                Ip_addr = (int) reply.yiaddr.s_addr;    /* yiaddr */
                          ^^^^^problem
  at line 188 to:

                Ip_addr = (int32) reply.yiaddr.s_addr;    /* yiaddr */
                          ^^^^^^^solution

  And of course, recompile.

  This worked on the src1229 (1991) version and may work on the
  most recent version. I did check to make sure that the bug still
  exists, but I haven't rechecked whether there are additional
  problems in the new version.



C-6.  How do I get KA9Q to support PPP?

Here is a sample ppp configuration file: 

# Set the host name
#
hostname aboba.slip.netcom.com
ip address [192.187.134.3]
#
#

#
# Time To Live is the maximum number of hops a packet can take
# before it is thrown away.  This command prevents an inadvertent
# infinite loop from occuring with packets in the network.
#
ip ttl 255
#
#-------------------------------------------------
#
# The Maximum Segment Size is the largest single transmission that
# you care to receive.  An mss of 216 will force folks to send you
# packets of 256 characters or less (counting the overhead). 
#
tcp mss 576
#
#-------------------------------------------------
#
# The Window parameter establishes the maximum number of bytes that
# may be outstanding before your system expects an ack.  If window is
# twice as big as mss, for example, there will be two active packets
# on the channel at any given time.  Large values of window provide
# improved throughput on full-duplex links, but are a problem on the
# air.  Keep mss <= window <= 2*mss if you're on the air.
#
#

C-7. How do I get KA9Q to support SLIP dialin?

If you are willing to settle for little or no security, there is not
much you have to change to allow a KA9Q system to receive calls, as
opposed to originating them. These should include:

1. Setting the system to autoanswer, via use of the ATS0=1 command to
the modem. 

2. Setting up a trace on the router end, to figure out if it's working,
via the command:
TRACE <interface> 1011, where <interface> = sl0 for SLIP, or another
value such as LAN or ether0 for the Ethernet interface. It's probably
a good idea to put a trace on all interfaces until the system is
shaken down. 

Note that without addition of a special dialing script, this setup
is completely insecure! 

For more details, see the FAQ posting enclosed below:

DOS Slip Server HOW-TO using ka9q
May 11, 1994
Bob Sanford
mailto:sanford@aurora.bld189.jccbi.gov
mailto:bob_sanford@mmacmail.jccbi.gov

This paper will attempt to help an individual interested in turning a 
DOS machine with ethernet and internet IP address into a dial-in slip 
server.  This paper is based on my experiences tying to configure my 
machine for just this purpose.  Although I am not an expert by any 
stretch of the imagination, I have learned a little from this 
experience. 

My configuration is a AST 486/66 Premmia running with 8 meg ram, 3C509 
Etherlink III network card, U.S. Robotics 14.4k modem on the server 
side. Gateway 486/33 with 4 meg ram, Zoom internal 14.4k modem on the client 
side.

Server side

1.  First acquire two IP addresses (or one if you already have one).  
The addresses must be in the same domain i.e. 123.123.123.xxx and 
123.123.123.xxy.  These numbers will be assigned by you system admin.  
Be sure that you set up names if your site has a name server.  Once 
again your sysadm can help here.

2.  Get the needed software.  I will place the needed software on my 
machine for anonymous FTP under slip_server.  The address is 
ftp://aurora.bld189.jccbi.gov/ (162.58.16.196).  Some of this software is 
shareware, so be sure to read the agreements.  Here is a list of the 
needed files from aurora:

	Required	nos11b.exe
			nos11b.map
			autoexec.nos
			autoexec.bat
			sliplog.zip
			slippr13.zip
			winsock.zip  (you probably have this)
			sliphow.txt  (this document)

	optional	config.sys

You will also need a packet driver for your network card.  The one you 
use with winsock should be o.k.		

3.  Create a dir named nos and place all the files there.  Then under 
the directory nos, create another dir called slip.  Place the 
sliplog.zip and slipper.zip files in there and unzip them.

4.  Edit the comlog.xxx files as outlined below:
	comlog.msg - place your clients Ip address there.
	comlog.pwd - The order has meaning.  1st name listed is sysop, he 
has special powers!  Read manual for more info.  The second is guest.  
The third is where I put my mine.  The first entry on one line is your 
password and will be what you type at the Login prompt when signing in.  
The number indicates amount of minutes available each day.  I set mine 
to 1440 ;)
	comlog.log - This is just a log file that shows who and when 
access was made to your system.

4.  Edit the autoexec.nos file inserting your Ip address and ethernet 
address where noted.  Save this file and place it in your ROOT (i.e. 
c:\) dir.  Be sure that you make all changes outlined in the beginning!

5.  Create a boot disk in your favorite dos format and place the new 
autoexec.bat on this disk.  Be sure that everything points to the proper 
place.  The config.sys is nothing different.  I'll include mine just for 
your info.

6.  Boot using your slip boot disk.  If all goes well you will be 
presented with:

Keyboard locked
enter password:

If you get this, and the auto-answer light on the modem is lit, all went 
well, on the server end.

Go ahead and enter the password and play around with nos.  Try to telnet 
etc, to make sure it is configured properly.  Once your happy, type lock 
to lock the keyboard.

If you fail to get this message, double check all your paths and where 
they point to.  I also had problems with my vectors, make sure that they 
are consistent through out the set up.  If you still have problems, 
contact me and we'll work together and try to solve it.


C-8.  Can I use KA9Q as a packet filter? 

Yes! Both the TextWin Large and CWRU NOS versions support this. You can
filter by incoming or outgoing, TCP or UDP port number, IP address, SYN
bit on, etc. For information, see the file filter.txt included with both
distributions. 

C-9.  Can I use KA9Q as a BOOTP server?

[Anyone know the answer to this?]

C-10. Where can I get a manual for KA9Q? 

A detailed manual for KA9Q can be downloaded using this bookmark:

      host: cases.pubaf.washington.edu
      port: 70
      type: 1
      path: 1c:/manual
      URL:  gopher://cases.pubaf.washington.edu/11c:/manual

C-11. Is there any way to stop KA9Q from listening to ICMP redirect
packets? RIP packets?

Yes! Assuming you get the Textwin large version, you can use the IP Filter
capability as follows:

ip filter pp0 permit in icmpxrd !192.187.157.0/24     192.187.157.0/24

The ICMPXRD refers to all ICMP packets other than redirects; as a result,
this command will allow all ICMP packets in the pp0 interface which
have a source address outside the 192.187.157.0 network, and which are
destined for the 192.187.157.0 network.

Using similar logic, you can kill RIP packets from non-trusted source
addresses.

C-12. Will KA9Q route sourcF-routed packets? If so, is there any way to
turn off this (rather undesirable) behavior?

It looks to me like KA9Q will route sourcF-routed packets, and it appears
that there is no way to turn this off, other than modifying the source code. 
The IP FILTER capability included in the TextWin large implementation, available 
at ftp://ftp.demon.co.uk doesn't offer anything to ameliorate this.

[Confirmation, anyone?]

C-13. I'm trying to use the TextWin version of KA9Q as a SLIP router
and it isn't working. What's wrong?

I use Textwin for PPP routing (see the config files) and it works
great. The problem is that SLIP support is no longer compiled in by
default. So you have to get the source code, change this, and recompile.

D. PCROUTE Questions

D-1. How do I get PCROUTE set up?

Some hints:

1. Use PCROUTE version 2.4 (see Resource Section for location)
2. Put the packet driver on Interrupt 0x60; it won't look for it in
   another location.
3. PCROUTE cannot handle variable length subnet masks. 
4. Use KA9Q instead; PCROUTE does not give error messages if it hangs,
   and does not support packet filtering.

However, beyond all this I question why anyone should prefer PCROUTE to
KA9Q, particularly considering the DIS version's IP filtering capability
and PPP support. In my opinion, the DIS KA9Q is superior to PCROUTE
[any of you out there who disagree, please pipe up!]

Similarly, PCBRIDGE has been superceded by KARLBRIDGE. 

D-2. I want to use WFW TCP/IP-32 to contact a host over a serial link,
but have no SLIP or PPP driver. Also, my provider has me setup for only
one machine. What do I do?

One somewhat convoluted approach is to use KA9Q or PCROUTE as a router,
turning off RIP, and using CSLIP. Wait: you said your provider couldn't
support that, right? Well, since CSLIP does not do address
negotiation, your provider will not know what is on the other end. 
What they will know how to do is to route packets to that CSLIP interface
based on your IP address. So as long as your TCP/IP-32 machine has the
IP address assigned to it, uses the router as its default route, 
and the router has the CSLIP interface as its default route, you'll
be ok. The host on the other side will not know that there is an
intervening machine, since the packets will bear the source address of the
TCP/IP-32 machine, and will be sent along with SLIP framing as required.
 
D-3. How do I get PCBRIDGE to use a SLIP or PPP driver?

To get this to work, use an Ethernet simulation driver, such as EtherSLIP,
SLIPPER, CSLIPPER, or EtherPPP. For the curious, this works by having the
driver snarfing ARP packets without passing them through, and stripping off
the Ethernet header before adding SLIP framing to the IP packet and passing
it on. You can invoke CSLIPPER in Ethernet simulation mode as follows:


D-4. Can I get PCROUTE to switch off RIP?

Yes. This is a PCROUTE configuration option.

E. Windows NT

E-1. Does Windows NT support OSPF or RIP? What can I do to get around this?

No, it doesn't. However, it does support ICMP redirects, so you can use this to
establish your routing table. 

E-2. Why shouldn't I try to install Trumpet Winsock on NT?

Because NT already has a built-in TCP/IP stack that is faster and more capable. If 
you need to do dialout, use RAS. 

E-3. Where can I find out more about SMB? What ports does it use?

The group comp.protocols.smb discusses the Server Message Block (SMB)
protocol. 

F. Hints for particular packages

F-1. How do I get DesQView X to run over the network?

V1.0 of DesQView X did not include a TCP/IP protocol stack.
Surprise! It required a TCP/IP implementation such as Beame & Whiteside,
PC-NFS, FTP's PC/TCP, or Novell LWP. They've corrected the situation 
in subsequent revisions. Contact QuarterDeck for assistance.

[pricing and availability, anyone?]

F-2. Why is NFS so slow compared with FTP?

NFS usually runs over RPC via UDP, rather than utilizing TCP. NFS only 
acknowledges a write request when the disk completes; there
are no sliding windows as in TCP. This makes NFS fairly inefficient.

Frances K. Selkirk (mailto:fks@vaxeline.ftp.com ) notes:

"There are NFS implementations that use TCP. They are only
faster over WANs. UDP is faster over most normally functioning LANs.
The lockstep paradigm is inherent to NFS, but some implementations
provide the ability to violate it - a speed win when the net is
reliable, a loss when it is not.

Whatever the transport, NFS will have more overhead than TCP, because
it is trying to transparently imitate an OS, and has to do a lot of
shuffling and translating."


F-3. Where can I get information on running NetWare and TCP/IP
      concurrently? 
      
The bit.listserv.novell group regularly posts a FAQ
which includes information on concurrent use of TCP/IP and Novell
IPX. 

F-4. What NetWare TCP/IP NLMs are out there and how do I get them
      to work? 

A public and known to work reliable TFTP and BOOTP daemon for NetWare
OS 3.1x/4.0x and NetWare/IP are available from 
ftp://ftp.novell.de/~/pub/netwire/unsupported/server/bootpd.exe. 
Contact: mailto:dirk@rhein-main.de

F-5. How do I get a telecom package supporting Int 14h redirection
      to work? 

INT 14 is the BIOS serial port interrupt. "Int 14h redirection" means
that Interrupt 14 is redirected to a Telnet connection to a 
particular host. This is useful because it allows a communications 
application to readily support telnet. Int 14h support is becoming 
increasing common, with vendors such as Mustang (QMODEM Pro) and
Procomm Plus for networks having included this feature. 

Aside from commercial stacks (such as FTP's PC/TCP),
try the TCPPORT program in WATTCP, available via 
ftp://dorm.rutgers.edu/pub/msdos/wattcp/apps.zip. However, I have
tried to get this to run with QMODEM Pro and found that I didn't
have enough RAM.

FTP's PC/TCP includes a program called tnglass that supports Int 14h
redirection.

F-6. I am having trouble running Netmanage Chameleon apps along with
WFW TCP/IP-32. What do I do? 

The problem is that you have two WINSOCK.DLLs installed, and when
you bring up a NetManage Chameleon app, it attempts to load NEWT. 
To get around this problem, on starting up WFW, you need to run a
TCP/IP-32 application such as Telnet or FTP. Once you do this, if
you run a Chemaleon app, it will default to the Microsoft WINSOCK.DLL
and everything will be fine.  

F-7. How do I get Windows For Workgroups to work alongside NetWare?

The easiest way to do this is to first install Novell with ODI
drivers, then install WFW v3.11. This version can run over ODI drivers,
and will install itself so as to be compatible with NetWare.

Another option is to use ODINSUP from Novell. This is an NDIS over 
ODI shim. This allows you to run software requiring ODI drivers, as well 
as software requiring NDIS drivers. Since IPX and TCP/IP are different 
protocols, you will not need to run PKTMUX. 

F-9. How come package X doesn't support the AppleTalk packet driver?

An AppleTalk driver is available as appletlk.com as part of the Crynwr 
driver set. NCSA Telnet 2.3.03 and NuPOP support it, but very few other
applications do, including Trumpet Winsock. This is because AppleTalk
corresponds to packet driver class 5, while most applications only
support Class 1 (Ethernet). 

Vendors with Windows Sockets implementations that support AppleTalk include
FTP Software's PC/TCP. WinQVT/Net's built-in TCP/IP stack version is also
rumored to be due to support AppleTalk in a future release.


F-10. NCSA Telnet doesn't reassemble fragments. What should I do?

Yell at the folks at NCSA to fix the problem, and to notify all
the people who are using the same TCP/IP code to insert the fix in
their software as well. This problem is really common, and
very annoying, and affects NCSA Telnet as well as PC Gopher III,
and POPmail. One possible workaround is to set the MTU to 576,
but this will not always work.

The following solution has been provided by Matthew T
Kaufman (mailto:matthew@echo.com):

How to get rid of the message:
"IP: fragmented packet received, frags not supported"
(assuming you have a C compiler and source code)
by Matthew T Kaufman

Many people on the net have complained that NCSA Telnet
(among other useful PC TCP/IP programs) doesn't properly handle 
fragmented IP packets. this problem becomes especially evident if 
any of your packets are arriving over SLIP connections.
I figured that the fastest way to get it to work would be to go
ahead and do it myself rather than wait for it to get to the
top of the list of desired features.

MANY other programs have used the NCSA TCP/IP implementation, so
if you maintain a program which does, PLEASE add this fix.
I (and MANY OTHERS) are unable to use your software until you do.

I posted the basic form of this fix around the beginning of the year,
but it didn't seem to make it into several subsequent versions of
related software, so I am posting and mailing this once again, in
a revised form, with helpful hints at the end.

I request only the following in return:
    This software revision is in the public domain. It may be
    used anywhere without further permission from the author.
    Please credit the origin of the fix in your release notes
    or bug fix document. (I am "Matthew Kaufman, matthew@echo.com")
    If you are the official maintainer of a software package
    which you have added this fix to, please send me an
    email note letting me know that the fix made it in.
    (So I don't need to worry that, for instance, the next
    version of NCSA Telnet or WinQVT/Net isn't going to
    include this) And, please add this fix as soon as possible.

So here's my fix:

The following are the changes to the NCSA Telnet TCP/IP engine to add
support for IP fragment reassembly. I also know how to make telnet compile 
properly under Borland C without running out of space in DGROUP (see the end of this)

if you have any questions, you can reach me at:
matthew@echo.com. I am willing to help, within the limits of my schedule.

changes follow:

file: engine\ip.c (the only file that needs to change)

delete the following:
>/*
>*  We cannot handle fragmented IP packets yet, return an error
>*/
>
>    if(p->i.frags &0x20) {           /* check for a fragmented packet */
>        netposterr(304);
>        return(1);
>      }

----------
after the line:
>    iplen-=hlen;

but before the lines:
> /*
> *  check to make sure that the packet is for me.


add this:

	/* check for fragment and handle. note that the &0x20 above is WRONG */
    if(p->i.frags)           /* NOW check for a fragmented packet - mtk add*/
    {
	ipfraghandle(p,iplen);	/* pass in computed iplen to save time */
        return(1);
      }

----------
and then, at the end of that file (ip.c) add this:

*** helpful hint:

if you run out of space in DGROUP, its because your compiler doesn't
place each 'far' data object in its own segment. To make things work,
you need to make the raw packet buffer be in its own segment.
Here's how:
in include/pcdefs.h search for:

-->  unsigned char far raw[17000];

 (the 17000 might be some other number... smaller, if someone tried to
  fix this before)
 and change to

-->  unsigned char far raw[17000]={0,0};	/* force into own segment */  
 
F-11.  I am trying to configure a Macintosh to set its parameters automatically 
on bootup, but it isn't working. What's wrong?

MacTCP has several bugs that can make it difficult to do automatic configuration.

If you are trying to configure the default gateway by sending RIP packets
to a Mac, you may have problems. While MacTCP can use RIP to configure
the default gateway, it has a bug in that it will not choose the lowest
advertised hop count, as it should. Instead, it uses the first RIP packet
that comes along.

But wait, there's more. When booted in "dynamic" mode, MacTCP puts out an
ICMP Address Mask Request. This method of determining the network mask is
often unsupported by other hosts. For example, my UNIX machine does not 
respond to these packets, and neither does KA9Q; some UNIX implementations 
such as System VR4 may return the wrong answer. As a result, my advice 
is not to automatically configure the subnet mask this way.

But wait, there's more. When booted in "server" configuration mode off
a LAN, MacTCP uses a buggy version of BOOTP. So if you send it a list of
gateways, it will just use the first one sent, even if it is down and one 
of the others is up.

F-12. I've heard that DHCP is a potential security risk. Is this true?

No, it isn't. The concern relates to the use of dynamically allocated 
addresses, not DHCP per se. BOOTP allows configurations to be stored 
in a table, so that you know that student 337.ip.berkeley.edu 
corresponds to Ralphie Root, in case they do something nasty. 
However, in addition to dynamic address allocation from a pool, 
the DHCP protocol supports reservation of certain IP addresses for 
various MAC addresses, as well as automatic assignment, where an 
address is dynamically assigned the first time, then continues to 
be assigned to the same host after that. The result is that going 
to DHCP won't lose you any flexibility.

Some services, such as FTP servers, will have problems with dynamically
allocated addresses if DNS records are not properly setup for them. To do
this, a given address must have a PTR record to an FQDN, and that FQDN must 
also point back to the address. This can be done by creating PTR and A
records for all the addresses in the pool.

F-13. What is TIA? 

TIA is a program that can be run on a UNIX shell account, which allows you
to run graphical applications such as Mosaic as though you were connected
over a SLIP link. You can therefore use TIA with stacks such as Trumpet
Winsock, Chameleon, etc. 

TIA does not require root permissions, so it can only use ports 1024+,
and therefore using it you can only run client applications, not
server apps. 

To use TIA, your provider must offer an "8-bit clean" environment. This is
*not* the same as 8-N-1 communications parameters, since even if you are 
using this, some characters may still cause problems.

Many Internet service providers (such as Netcom) now officially endorse TIA
for use on shell accounts. While right now only SLIP is supported, support
for CSLIP and PPP is reportedly in the works.

F-14. What PC TCP/IP implementations support recent advances?  

Here is a list of vendors supporting various advances:

Long Fat Pipes:
T/TCP:
TOS queuing:
Path MTU discovery (UDP):
Path MTU discovery (TCP):
OSPF:
Round-robin DNS:
DHCP client: FTP Software, Microsoft TCP/IP-32, NT
NFS over TCP:
SNMP Agents: Chameleon, FTP Software, Windows NT

[Vendors out there, please pipe up if you support one or more of these!]

F-15. What network adapters have on-board SNMP agents?

This is by no means a complete list, but the following vendors are known to
support this:
MasterLAN ISA by UB Networks, Inc. 800-777-4LAN.
ProNIC LAN10MM by Zenith Electronics Corp. 800-788-7244.

F-16. What is the easiest way to get WFW and Novell to coexist?

Before installing WFW v3.11, install Novell on the machine using an
ODI driver. Then install WFW, and after that, the TCP/IP-32 protocol
stack. The installers will automatically detect the present of
Novell Netware, and will complete the setup for you, usually without
a hitch. WFW v3.11 can talk directly to ODI drivers, so you will
not need ODINSUP.

F-17. I'm trying to use packet driver software alongside WFW v3.11 and
am having a hell of a time. What should I do?

Your problem is probably that you are trying to run NDIS v3.0 drivers
alongside DIS_PKT. This will not work. What you need is Dan Lanciani's
NDIS3PKT.386, a VxD packet driver over NDIS shim. See part 2 for
details on how to get this.

F-18. What proxy software is available for those concerned about security?

WS_FTP can act as a proxy client to some ftpd version. Does anyone know what
the appropriate server side is? Mosaic has also reportedly been "socksified." 
Any further details on this?

Information on proxies is available at tns.com.

F-19. How do I mount ftp.microsoft.com using File Manager? 

This is a really cool thing, since it is a lot faster than most graphical
FTP applications, and is easy to do. Be aware that for this to work, you
must *not* be behind a firewall. 

1. Edit the WIN\LMHOSTS file to include the following line:
198.105.232.1        FTP

2. Set Microsoft TCP/IP up to "Resolve using LMHOSTS file"

3. Open the File Manager, and select Connect Network Drive from the Disk
Menu. Type:  \\FTP\DATA to the path to mount the FTP server area in the File Manager.
Do *not* check the box saying "Reconnect on startup"

4. Copy files.

5. Select Disconnect Network Drive from the Disk menu. 

F-20. I am having problems connecting to a Windows NT PPP server. What
      should I do? 

On Windows NT you are probably using CHAP as the authentication protocol 
within LCP. Try using PAP authentication instead on both client and server.
This can be accomplished by unchecking "Require encrypted authentication," 
which is the default setting. 

If this still doesn't work, you may be having problems in the IPCP
negotiation. Leaving the remote and local IP addresses set to 0.0.0.0
may solve the problem, allowing these parameters to be set by the NT
server. 

F-21. When should I use COMT?

COMT is a "Telnet modem" that can be used to allow any communications
program to use Telnet. Since COMT acts like a modem, you can telnet
to a site using commands such as ATDTwell.com (to dial The WELL).

Why should you care about this? 
a. If you want to do an XMODEM, YMODEM, or ZMODEM transfer over
Telnet. For this to work, your Telnet implementation will need
to negotiate a binary (8-bit) channel. 
b. You want to use RIP or ANSI graphics. Via COMT you can use
a program such as QMODEM Pro to login to that RIP BBS.
c. You need to dial in to CompuServe or AOL over the Internet.
Using COMT you can fool the standard versions of these programs
into dialing in over the Internet.

F-22. What version of POP should I be running alongside Eudora?

A lot of people (including me!) run the June 1991 1.83 beta of POP 
called popper, available via:
ftp://ftp.CC.Berkeley.edu/pub/pop/solaris2/popper.tar.Z

This generally works ok, but there are newer versions out there. These
include: 

ftp://ftp.qualcomm.com/quest/unix/servers/popper/qpop2.1.3-r5.tar.Z
(Qualcom POP server)

ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/imap/imap.tar.Z
(ipop3d, part of the IMAP distribution)

F-23. How do I use Netscape to read local files?

To use Netscape without a network, you will need the following file:
ftp://ftp.mcom.com/netscape/unsupported/windows/mozock.dll
Install this as winsock.dll; you will then be able to run Netscape to
view local files. 

F-24. I want to run an NNTP server under OS/2. Does such an animal exist?

Apparently yes. There is an OS/2 native appliation called changi01.zip
that uses inews and UUPC to connect to a news server. This runs under
OS/2 v3.0, and IBM TCP/IP v2.0. 

G. Information for developers

G-1. What publicly distributable TCP/IP stacks are there that I can
     use to develop my own applications?

In writing an application, you can use device drivers provided by
particular vendors, or you can opt for an Application Binary Interface (ABI) 
that supports multiple TCP/IP protocol stacks, such as Winsock. For a given 
version of Windows, Winsock is an ABI for both Windows 3.x and Windows NT 
(via the NT Win16 subsystem).

Device drivers are included with PC-NFS and Beame & Whiteside's
BW-TCP.  Free examples of ABIs are the WATTCP API, the NCSA API
(public domain), the Trumpet ABI from Peter Tattum, and the NuPOP ABI.

All major TCP/IP vendors have by now implemented Windows Sockets.

G-2. Where can I get a copy of the Windows Sockets FAQ?

A separate developer-oriented FAQ file about Windows Sockets created
by Mark Towfiq is available on
ftp://SunSite.UNC.EDU/pub/micro/pc-stuff/ms-windows/winsock/FAQ
and ftp://Microdyne.COM/pub/winsock/FAQ

An alternative source for the FAQ is ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/

G-3. How do I do multicasting using Windows Sockets?

Information on use of multicasting is available via:
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/WinSock/ms-ext/MULTCAST.TXT
and
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/WinSock/ms-ext/winsock.h

This is the sampler version of the NetManage Chameleon 
TCP/IP product. Available via:

TRUMPET WINSOCK

Recommendation
Trumpet WinSock v2.0b
	
A shareware version of Windows Sockets that runs over packet 
drivers and requires WINPKT. The latest version supports
PPP as well as SLIP/CSLIP, and Socks Proxies. Available as:
ftp://ftp.utas.edu.au/pc/trumpet/winsock/twsk20b.zip,

MICROSOFT TCP/IP

Recommendation
Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for WFW 3.11
	
Adds TCP/IP to WFW 3.11. This stack is unique in that it
supports NetBIOS over TCP/IP, allowing you to mount shares 
across the Internet, including ftp.microsoft.com. Available as:  
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/peropsys/windows/Public/tcpip/ 

CHAMELEON SAMPLER

Recommendation
Chameleon Sampler   Free

This is an introductory version of Chameleon by NetManage, that
is currently packaged with various Windows Internet books (including mine).
This supports SLIP/CSLIP/PPP, but not network adapters. In my
opinion this is the easiest to setup, fully functional dialup IP
stack around. The package includes applications for mail, ftp,
telnet, and ping. Telnet supports TTY, ANSI, VT52, VT100, and VT220
emulation. However, be aware that this stack should not be installed
if you already have another WINSOCK DLL loaded; several applications
in Chameleon Sampler do not check for another WINSOCK version and
will load the NEWT stack anyway.

*Suggestion
Internet Connect v2

Internet-Connect v2.0 from Core Systems is a TCP/IP stack implemented
as a 32-bit VxD and DLL, thus requiring no DOS memory. It supports
both LAN (Ethernet) and SLIP/CSLIP/PPP connections. Other features
include demand dial, dynamic address assignment, scripting, multiple 
interfaces with IP routing and forwarding, and BOOTP/DHCP.

Internet-Connect v2.0 provides a complete Winsock API. A Windows-based 
setup program and network configuration utility is included. Available via:
ftp://oak.oakland.edu/SimTel/win3/winsock/inetv2.zip


DIALERS

Recommendation
Dialer    Free

DIALER is a Windows program that will dial up a host and then 
run a series of WIndows applications. It isn't needed with 
Trumpet Winsock anymore, since this now has its own built-in 
scripting language. Available at:

SLIP AND PPP DRIVERS

Suggestion
SLIPPER v1.5	Free
CSLIPPER	Free

SLIPPER and CSLIPPER get rave reviews for being less 
obtrusive than some other SLIP/CSLIP drivers so that 
the machine loses fewer clock ticks. The result is 
that the clock stays more accurate. SLIP/CSLIP operation 
is supported at up to 57.6 Kbps on a 486. CSLIPPER is a 
version which supports Van Jacobson header compression. 
Supports PKTMUX.

ETHERPPP	Free

Glenn McGregor, formerly of Merit Network, has released 
ETHERPPP, a PPP packet driver that simulates a class

QVTNet is a Windows v3.1 application that supports FTP 
client and server (not fully graphical; commands are 
entered at the bottom of the window), telnet (up to 
15 simultaneous sessions), mail (SMTP and POP3), 
NNTP (up to 30 newsgroups) and lpr.  It is written 
as a DLL, and comes in several versions: a Windows 
Sockets-compatible version (recommended); a 32-bit 
version;  and a version with it's own built-in 
TCP/IP stack. The version with the built-in stack 
requires that you load PKTINT in DOS before running 
it, and also requires you to supply your own packet 
drivers, and is compatible with AppleTalk as well as 
class 6 SLIP drivers. 

Note: the 16-bit Winsock version of WinQVT/Net has

*Recommendation
Netscape v1.0	Free

Although it could use some improvements in the speed area,
and it has its share of bugs, Netscape is now recognized as
the preeminent Web browser. The interface is clean, it includes 
buttons linking to some excellent Web pages at mcom.com, it supports
proxy servers, mailto: URLs, and best of all, a newsreader
that completely outclasses the competition. For example, 
while reading news, you can follow URLs in the text. 
Biggest complaint: no direct support for WAIS URLs (no PC
Web browser supports this, only XMosaic does). 
Second biggest complaint: Mozilla is the ugliest mascot 
since Spuds MacKenzie. The current release is a 16-bit
application.

This is a demo version of a commercial program called

*Recommendation
Windows Mosaic v2.0a9	free

In my opinion, the release of Netscape has rendered Mosaic
(as well as its commercial cousins, Spyglass Mosaic and
AIR Mosaic) obsolete. However, it still may be of
historical interest for some.  

The Internet's Swiss army knife: supports hypertext links, 
font styles, embedded pictures, sounds, and movies. An amazing 
application. Compatible with Windows Sockets. Version 2.0 
supports forms, clickable regions within pictures. To use this
to read local documents without a TCP/IP stack installed, you
will need to download the Null Winsock. 

Please note: Since Mosaic is now a 32-bit app,
unless you are running Windows NT, or Windows 95 you must install 
Win32s (available from ftp.microsoft.com) in order to run Mosaic. Also,
make sure you get the viewers for sounds, JPEG, and MPEG.

implement Windows Sockets. It also runs with wslpd's new 
"raw spooler," provided that you get lpd up and running 
prior to printing, since it will timeout quickly. Also, 
remember to name the spool files correctly and once you set 
the default spool directory, don't specify a full path in 
defining a spool file.

driver applications on top of the NDIS v3.0 interface used by WfW 3.11,
Windows NT, and Windows 95. Previously, it was necessary to run
NDIS v2.0 in order to use DIS_PKT, which prevented WfW from
using 32-bit adapter drivers.

PDEther v1.03

Supports ODI over packet drivers. Although I haven't had much 
success with it, others have used it on thousands of machines 
and found it better than ODIPKT, especially under Windows. 
Available as:
ftp://sjf-lwp.novell.com/odi/pdether/getpde103.zip

Recommendation
Odipkt v3.0

Supports packet drivers over ODI. This is the recommended 
method of getting Novell NetWare to coexist with a packet-driver 
based TCP/IP stack. Compatible with WINPKT.

Suggestion
ODINSUP

This is an NDIS over ODI shim from Novell. This allows you to run 
software requiring ODI drivers, as well as software requiring NDIS 
drivers. Since IPX and TCP/IP are different protocols, you will not 
need to run PKTMUX. 

This was available via: 
ftp://ftp.novell.com/netwire/novfiles/client.kit/doswin/files/WSDOS1.EXE

But it has apparently vanished. Anyone know where it has gone?  

 
TCP/IP AND NETWARE

Downright speculation
BYU Netware shell drivers	free

Allows you to build an IPX.COM that runs over packet drivers.  
Works by  providing .obj and .lan files for the Neware shell 
generation program, shgen.exe. Running shgen.exe produces netX.com 
as well as an ipx.com for your interface card. Again, I've had 
better results with ODIPKT than with this.

PKTMUX v1.2	Free

This program allows multiple TCP/IP protocol stacks to 
use a single packet driver. It can also run over shims 
such as DIS_PKT; I have used it with four or more 
simultaneous DOS-based applications. Works great. However, 
if you are only using a single DOS TCP/IP application 
under Windows, use WINPKT instead, since it takes less 
memory and is faster.

KarlBridge v1.41

This software, which uses WATTCP, provides a two port 
Ethernet to Ethernet bridge that can filter based on any 
Ethernet protocol, including IP, XNS, DECNET, LAT, 
EtherTalk, NetBEUI, Novell IPX, etc. It will also 
act as an IP firewall by filtering IP packets based on 
IP address/network/subnet combinations and socket numbers. 
It can also filter DECNET and AppleTalk Phase 1 & 2 packets. 
It now supports SNMP queries for remote management. Novell 
SAP and NCR WaveLAN filtering are coming in a future release.

Recommendation
KA9Q	
Educational Use	Free
Commercial Use	$50

There are several versions of KA9Q, each with different 
capabilities. The current most capable versions are the 
ones put together by the folks at Demon Internet Services 
(DIS) in the UK, and the version put out by Ashok Aiyar at 
CWRU. CWRU Version 1.0b is based on the N1BEE 0.85-beta 
which in turn is based on PA0GRI 2.0m NOS, and includes 
support for NTP, CSO, Gopher, FTP, and SMTP/POP2/POP3 
servers, plus VT102 and packet filtering support. Base 
code is by Ashok Aiyar, ashok@biochemistry.cwru.edu. 
The Textwin version from DIS does not include Gopher 
support, but does support Domain Name Service and 
can act as an NNTP server. 

KA9Q can route TCP/IP packets over X.25, Ethernet, 
LocalTalk (with a special version), and serial lines 
(via SLIP/CSLIP/PPP). It supports connection to 56 
Kbps leased lines via a CSU/DSU and an SCC card, and 
supports up to 4 serial ports per machine. This means 
you can purchase a 56 Kbps Internet link, then divide it 
among 4 users, bringing the cost way down. KA9Q is a 
useful tool for sysops looking to hook their systems 
to the Internet, regardless of what kind of computer 
the BBS runs on.

UNIX SERVERS

Recommendation
Samba v1.8      Free

Samba includes a UNIX-based SMB file and print server, 
as well as a UNIX SMB client and a NetBIOS nameserver (NBNS). 
It can be used with clients such as Windows for Workgroups, 
Windows NT, OS/2, Pathworks, and LanManager for DOS. This 
means that it can attach to Windows NT and WFW servers or 
mount portions of the UNIX file system on these machines. 
You can also print from UNIX to an SMB printer by adding 
an entry in /etc/printcap. It supports username/password 
security, umask support, guest connections and system 
attribute mapping. Samba is being run under Linux, 
SunOS, Solaris, SVR4, Ultrix, OSF1, AIX, BSDI, NetBSD, 
Sequent, HP-UX, SGI, FreeBSD, and NeXT.

I just installed this on my UNIX machine, and I am ecstatic. 
I haven't gotten the print server to work yet (hints anyone?), 
but I am sharing files between the UNIX machine and others 
running WFW and NT. Compared with publicly distributable NFS 
implementations, this SMB-based solution integrates well with 
Windows, is easier to secure (transfers occur over TCP, not UDP) 
leaves the PCs with quite a bit more low memory (570K vs.
470K for NFS), is more stable, and faster than most NFS 
implementations to boot. What more could you ask for?

Not only does Samba implement B-node technology, but it also 
appears to support P and M node technology via a UNIX implementation 
of the NetBIOS Name Server (NBNS), which runs as a daemon called 
nmbd. The SMB server, smbd, can either be called up by inetd 
or run as a daemon.

Other nice features include proper locking as required by OLE2 apps. This
is not yet handled by any NFS implementations. Only major deficit is 
that browsing is not yet supported.

X-Ray/Winsock API Trace/Debugger        $169

X-Ray/Winsock is a debugger for the Windows Sockets API, which shows the
interaction between a Windows application and  theWinsock API in  realtime.
X-Ray displays Winsock API functions both before and after the call with
parameters, constants and flags displayed according to their "C" header
file equivalents. All "send" and "recv" data can be displayed in Hex and/or
ASCII. All pointers are checked for validity. X-Ray has a
selectable circular or fixed trace buffer with 2000 event capacity.

Applications that are X-Rayed do not need debug information such as Codeview or
modifications to the application. X-Ray can be used at the customer site,
using production versions of applications.

X-Ray has a unique floating "Details" window that displays individual trace
records. VCR style controls are used to selectively view any records currently 
in the trace buffer. The trace  buffer can be searched for a parameter value,
error code, or other information. Context-sensitive help is available for
all Winsock API functions.

X-Ray can trace Winsock functions occurring in multiple applications simul-
taneously. Individual applications can be selected for tracing. X-Ray has
multiple logging options, including DBWin and file.

Recommendation 
PC/TCP v2.2	$350 
Kernel Only	$200

PC/TCP v2.2 offers a solid implementation of TCP/IP for DOS, with some
Windows applications.  It includes NFS for UDP or TCP, remote login
(telnet, rlogin, supdup) with a variety of terminal emulators, file
transfer (FTP, TFTP, rcp), electronic mail and news (pop2, pop3, pcmail,
mail, SMTP, NNTP), printing (LPR and print redirection) and informational
utilities (whois, ping, finger, host). Some kerberos support is available
to domestic customers. If used alongside ConcordCommunications Mapware
controllers, this product is capable of handling both OSI and TCP/IP
concurrently. 3270 support is OK.

It is available for Ethernet (DIX or 802.3), Token Ring, SLIP, PPP,
LocalTalk and X.25 interfaces, over packet drivers, ODI drivers, NDIS
drivers, banyan drivers, and ASI drivers.

This package does not route; you are therefore restricted to installing it
with PPP, SLIP or Ethernet, but not some combination of the above.

PC/TCP is incompatible with Stacker. As of version 2.2, the Windows
applications have been improved. New to Windows support is the ability to
mount and unmount NFS drives from within Windows, and to use PCNFSD printer
services from Windows.

The 2.2 manual includes a 6-page install guidelette, and now offers a
menu-driven installation and configuration program.

Suggestion
PC/TCP OnNet 1.1 for DOS/Windows  $350 
PC/TCP OnNet 1.1 for DOS/Windows  $450 (with PC/TCP)

This is a graphical package from FTP Software with a VxD TCP/IP
stack. It includes support for FTP, Telnet, NFS, news, mail, finger,
DHCP, BOOTP, NetBIOS, SNMP, as well as support for packet or ODI drivers. 
It also supports network printing. There is a bug in the telnet vt-100/220 
emulation which is fixable via ftp'ing a new version.

Features of the software (from Graham Kenville, mailto:graham@mitta.com ):
1. Provides a nice GUI based way to configure printers and drive
   attachment which is pretty easy to use. Makes it possible
   to automatically mount whatever drives you usually mount
   each time you start Windows. You can provide a default user
   name. You only have to enter the password once per session
   to mount all drives.
2. You can set up any PC running PC-TCP/OnNet to be a print server
   for PC's and Unix. The icon and setup for this is all there,
   but I haven't tried it yet.
3. The telnet is pretty good, provides VT-100/200 & DEC character
   support. Allows you to print screen, save scroll-back buffer
   to disk or print it, you can set the number of scroll-back lines
   up to (I think) 3000.
4. Provides a ping/traceroute utility which works ok.
