I. Where do I get X programs?

   1 X Consortium's contrib ftp site X clients (as the applications are
     normally referred to) are available for anonymous ftp from many
     sites; the most popular of these being the X Consortium's contrib
     archive at ftp.x.org (198.112.44.100).
     
     Note that there is a limit of 90 anonymous-ftp users at a time. The
     contrib directory, organized into sub-directories by category; e.g.
     editors/, audio/, games/, fonts/, etc., archives clients that have
     been tested with X11R6.
     
     With the release of R6, the H U G E collection of clients in
     R5contrib is considered "old" (although they will still work with
     R4 & R5 servers). The file 0ftpxorg.dir , maintained by Daniel S.
     Lewart, is a concerted attempt at organizing the plethora of
     packages available. It contains descriptions of the more popular
     (and sometimes obscure) packages.
     
     New releases and updates to contributed packages will be placed in
     /contrib/ ; /R5contrib/ will eventually be deleted.
     
     
   2 X11R6 distribution The X11R6 distribution, available for ftp, also
     contains clients written by the X Consortium, in:
     
     ftp.x.org:/pub/R6untarred/xc/programs
     
     and clients contributed by others, in:
     
     ftp.x.org:/pub/R6untarred/contrib/programs .
     
     The complete R6 distribution, including contibuted clients, is also
     available on CD-ROM. Information on purchasing the CD-ROM is
     available in the file:
     
     ftp.x.org:/GettingR6
     
     
   3 comp.sources.x newsgroup and archives New clients are often posted
     to the USENET group comp.sources.x . These clients are then
     archived and available for anonyomous ftp, at various sites.
     
     
     In North America:
     
     
     usc.edu:/archive/usenet/sources/comp.sources.x/
     
     halcyon.com:/dec/.0/usenet/comp.sources.x/
     
     calypso-2.oit.unc.edu:/pub/archives/comp.sources.x/
     
     sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/archives/comp.sources.x/
     
     ftp.wustl.edu:/usenet/comp.sources.x/
     
     
     In Europe:
     
     
     ftp.eu.net:/windows/X/comp.sources.x/
     
     ftp.sunet.se:/pub/usenet/comp.sources.x/
     
     unix.hensa.ac.uk:/pub/uunet/usenet/comp.sources.x/
     
     
     In Australia:
     
     
     plaza.aarnet.edu.au:/usenet/comp.sources.x/
     
     The archive sites usually have an index file that briefly lists the
     contents of each volume in the archives. New packages or patches
     and bug-fixes are announced in comp.windows.x.announce ; it would
     be worth your while to subscribe to this newsgroup.
     
     (Op-Ed: If at all possible, try not to ftp large packages during
     prime-time (08:00 - 18:00 ftp-site local-time) so as not to
     load-down the computing resources at the sites that graciously make
     these facilities available. Also, try to use a ftp-server that is
     geographically near your own site.
     
     Now, I don't expect everyone to stay-up past their bed-time just to
     ftp a package in the middle of the night. I have some nifty
     shell-scripts to perform unattended ftp'ing using cron(1). If
     anyone wants a copy of these scripts, mail me a note and I will
     mail them off to you.)

II. Does anyone know of any good X-based editors other than xedit?


(Religious wars have been fought on this extremely sensitive topic;
flames about the merits of *your* favourite editor will be summarily
ignored, though submissions of additional editors will be gladly
accepted.)


   1 +Snapshot+ GNU Emacs, an extensible, customizable real-time display
     editor, is The One True Editor. It was developed and is maintained
     by Richard Stallman. It offers true Lisp--smoothly integrated into
     the editor--for writing extensions, and provides an interface to
     the X Window System (it works equally well on a dumb-terminal
     (VT100, etc.)).
     
     In addition to its powerful native command set, extensions which
     emulate other popular editors (vi, EDT (DEC's VMS editor) and
     Gosling (aka Unipress) Emacs) are distributed. Features making it a
     full computing support environment include: pull-down menus,
     multiple fonts, multiple windows with multiple views into the same
     file, on-the-fly syntax highliting for various languages including
     C.
     
     Users seeking help or guidance with using or installing Emacs can
     post queries (after consulting the GNU Emacs FAQ (please!)) to
     gnu.emacs.help (a mailing-list gatewayed to USENET),
     comp.emacs.xemacs and comp.emacs . ( alt.religion.emacs offers
     support for the truly devout seeking enlightenment.)
     
     User contributed additions in the form of LISP packages (games
     (like tetris), PIM's, databases, calendars, mailers, etc.) are
     available from the definitive LISP archive:
     
     archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/
     
     GNU Emacs (or sometimes, a less feature-laden derivative) is
     available for ever system on this earth; the latest version of GNU
     Emacs is 19.28.
     
     What's GNU? GNU's Not Unix!
     
     (Note that various media, containing all the sources (of course)
     and pre-compiled binaries (all major platforms) of all their
     applications (emacs, gcc, gdb, gnuchess, etc.) and utilities
     (groff, flex, gmake, etc.) in addition to the latest release of X),
     may be ordered from the Free Software Foundation (for more
     information, send email to gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu or refer to the
     order form (ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/ORDERS)). The
     latest version of Emacs is available for anonymous ftp at the
     following (North American) sites which also archive all the GNU
     utilities:

     William Smith has made the source and binaries for GNU EMACS
     version 19.27 available via anonymous ftp on:
     
     das.wang.com:/ftp/wjs/gnu/emacs
     
     Binaries (built with R5 Athena Widgets) are avilable for:
     
        1 IBM RS6000 3.2.0-3.2.5 with X11R4 or X11R5;
        2 HP-UX 9.00-9.04 series 800 with X11R5;
        3 Solaris 2.3 with X11R5;
        4 SCO 3.2.4.0 (ODT 2.0) - 3.2.4.2 (ODT 3.0) with X11R5; and
        5 MSDOG (oemacs 4.1 GNU Emacs 19.19).
     
     
   2 XEmacs 19.11 , formerly Lucid Emacs 19.10, is derived from GNU
     Emacs version 19. Pre-compiled binaries are available for most
     popular platforms; the reader is encouraged to check-out the XEmacs
     home-page for details about the specific files to retrive.
     
     Unlike GNU Emacs, XEmacs absolutely requires the X Window System to
     run; VT100 support is in the works. Some of its popular features
     include:
     
        * the ability to embed pixmaps of arbitrary size in a buffer;
        * use of variable width fonts;
        * on a machine with audio hardware, XEmacs can play sound files
          instead of the default X beep;
        * embedding an X window in a buffer in the same way as a pixmap;
          external programs (such as GhostScript, or an MPEG player) can
          then render arbitrary graphics on that window. The latest
     version is available for anonymous ftp from the canonical
     distribution point:
     
     cs.uiuc.edu:/pub/xemacs
     
     Since cs.uiuc.edu has a 20-user limit on ftp connections, you
     should also be able to get it at the following mirror sites:
     
     self.stanford.edu:/pub/xemacs/
     
     ftp.uu.net:/systems/gnu/xemacs/
     
     ftp.ai.mit.edu:/pub/xemacs/

     ftp.germany.eu.net:/pub/packages/lucid-emacs/
     
     ftp.th-darmstadt.de:/pub/editors/xemacs/
     
     audrey.levels.unisa.edu.au:/xemacs/
     
     ftp.sunet.se:/pub/gnu/lucid/lemacs/

     ftp.technion.ac.il:/pub/unsupported/gnu/xemacs/
     
     
   3 aXe (an X editor) was developed by Jim Wight. It is a simple to use
     text editor that represents a significant improvement over xedit.
     Built around the Athena Text Widget it features, amongst other
     things:
     
        * multiple windows and multiple buffers;
        * menu interface with configurable menus;
        * keyboard macros;
        * parenthesis matching and regular expression searching;
        * restricted or unlimited undo;
        * ability to change font;
        * both brief and comprehensive (hypertext) on-line help.
     
     The latest version of aXe, 6.1.2, is avaliable for ftp from:
     
     ftp.x.org:/contrib/editors/aXe-6.1.2.tar.Z
     
     
   4 xcoral, developed by Lionel Fournigault, Bruno Pages and Dominique
     Leveque is a multi-window text editor. It features:
     
        * a built-in browser to navigate through C functions and C++
          classes, methods and files;
        * a built-in ANSI C interpreter to dynamically extend user
          functions, key bindings, modes etc;
        * variable-width fonts;
        * menus, scrollbars, buttons, kill-buffers, search, macros, undo
          regions, and a online manual;
        * commands are accessible from either menus or standard key
          bindings.
     
     The latest version of xcoral, 2.1, is available for anonymous ftp
     at:
     
     ftp.inria.fr:/X/contrib/clients/xcoral-2.1.tar.Z

   5 asedit, developed by Andrzej Stochniolis, is a text editor built
     around the Motif text widget. It includes support for the following
     languages: English, Dutch, French, German, Polish, Portuguese and
     Swedish. All commands and messages are localized for each language;
     the context sensitive, hypertext on-line help, however, is only
     available in English. It features:
     
        * multiple editing windows with "point and click" interface;
        * drag and drop support (Motif 1.2 and above only);
        * dialog for printer-selection and extra print options for
          printing either selected text or the complete document;
        * multiple undo and redo of edits;
        * user customizable commands and filters;
        * support for emacs keyboard bindings.
     
     Version 1.3 of asedit (International Free Release) is available for
     ftp from:
     
     ftp.x.org:/contrib/editors/asedit-1.3.tar.Z
     
     src.doc.ic.ac.uk:/packages/X11-contrib/editors/asedit-1.3.tar.Z
     
     
   6 Refer to part 4 of the comp.lang.tcl FAQ for an extensive list of
     editors that have been written with Tcl/Tk. The latest version of
     the FAQ is always available for anonymous ftp from:
     
     ftp.aud.alcatel.com:/tcl/docs/tcl-faq.part04.gz
     
     
   7 sam, developed by Rob Pike, is a hybrid command-oriented/GUI multi-
     file editor for AT&T's Plan 9, that has been ported to X.
     
     sam was developed as an editor for use by programmers, and tries to
     join the styles of the Unix text editor ed(1) with that of
     interactive cut and paste editors by providing a comfortable
     mouse-driven interface to a program with a solid command-language
     driven by regular expressions.
     
     sam extends the regular expression paradigm beyond line-oriented
     ASCII files by introducing "structural regular expressions", which
     can partition a file into arbitrary textual units.
     
     sam supports the UTF-8 file-format-- an 8-bit encoding of the 16
     bit Unicode character set which has nice properties like ASCII
     being preserved. This feature allows sam to simultaneously
     represent multiple languages in a single file. Although full
     Unicode support is unavailable, sam's flexibility with
     international text is still beyond that of most text editors.
     
     The latest version of sam is available for anonymous ftp from:
     
     research.att.com:/dist/sam
     
     
   8 +Snapshot+ vile/xvile, (VI Like Emacs), developed by Paul Fox, is a
     vi workalike put together from Micro-Emacs. It works in an xterm
     (vile) and as a true X client (xvile).
     
     vile features:
        * multiple 'windows' (split screen);
        * keyboard macros (nothing from .exrc, including map);
        * understands SIGWINCH (window resizes);
        * understands the xterm-style mouse, with ":set xterm-mouse".
     
     xvile features:
        * all the features of vile and additionally,
        * mouse control over the current window (with an option to
          center the chosen point);
        * rudimentary selections (best feature so far is that it always
          inserts the text; no string of bells if you forget to go into
          insert mode);
        * font & selection resource control;
        * on-the-fly font change.
     
     vile and xvile build from the same backage; the latest version,
     4.5, is usually available for anonymous ftp at:
     
     ftp.cayman.com:/pub/vile
     
     Sometimes there's a compiled DOS binary there too. The author
     maintains a mailing list; if you wish to be added to the list, send
     email to <pgf@foxharp.boston.ma.us>.
     
     
   9 NEdit , developed by Mark Edel, is a GUI editor for X/Motif-based
     Unix and VMS systems.
     
     Nedit features:
     
        * multi-window, mouse based editing;
        * multi-level undo;
        * comprehensive on-line help;
        * auto-indent and block indentation adjustment;
        * parenthesis flashing and matching;
        * finding lines directly from compiler error output;
        * Unix ctags support. Nedit has been tested on Silicon Graphics,
     Sun (Solaris & SunOS), HP, OSF/1, DEC Ultrix, IBM AIX, and VMS
     systems. The latest version, 3.1, is available for anonymous ftp
     at:
     
     ftp.fnal.gov:/pub/nedit/v3_1_1/nedit_source.tar.Z
     
     ftp.x.org:/contrib/editors/nedit/nedit_source.tar.Z
     
     Pre-built binaries for the mentioned architectures are available

III. Does anyone have any suggestions for X-based news-readers?

   1 xrn (not threaded) NNTP newsreader, developed by Ellen M. Sentovich
     & Rick L. Spickelmier (now maintained by Jonathan I. Kamens), is
     based on rn (a termcap-based news-reader written by the reverend
     Larry Wall); it is popular with novice users and looks rather
     elegant when compiled with the 3D Athena Widgets developed by
     formidable Kaleb Keithley.
     
     The latest version 7.0, is available for anonymous ftp from:
     
     ftp://ftp.x.org:/contrib/applications/xrn/xrn-7.0.tgz
     
     ftp://remote-access.cam.ov.com:/pub/xrn/xrn.tgz
     
     
   2 mxrn (not threaded) Motif-based NNTP news reader that has had part
     of the functionality of `rn' added since a number of users are `rn'
     users. Much of the `rn' functionality that mxrn currently has was
     not in the original plan; e.g. kill-files.
     
     The latest version is 6.18, but 6.17 seems to be the only one
     widely available for ftp at the following sites:
     
     geocub.greco-prog.fr:/pub/X11/mxrn.tar.Z
     
     sun.soe.clarkson.edu:/pub/src/mxrn/
     
     
   3 +Snapshot+ xvnews (not threaded) is a simple, intuitive Open-LOOK
     compliant NNTP-based newsreader that uses the XView libraries.
     
     The latest release, 2.3, is available for ftp from:
     
     ftp.twi.tudelft.nl:/pub/news/xvnews-2.3.tar.gz
     
     ftp.uu.net:/networking/news/readers/xvnews/xvnews-2.3.tar.gz.
     
     
   4 +Snapshot+ GNUS (threaded) if you have Emacs 19.x installed (above)
     , you can use GNUS 4.1, developed by Masanobu Umeda, from within
     Emacs. It uses NNTP to communicate with the news-server and is part
     of the standard emacs distribution as of emacs 19.x. An updated
     version of GNUS, released with Emacs 19.27 supports pull-down menus
     containing common newsreader functions.
     
     
   5 Netscape is a Web-browser, developed by Mosaic Communications (now
     called something else entirely and mostly consisting of the
     developers of the popular NCSA Xmosaic Web-browser), that has a
     threaded news-reader built-in.
     
     Netscape is available from the Mosaic Comm. home-page at:
     
     http://www.mcom.com
     
     or via ftp at:
     
     ftp://ftp.mcom.com .
     
     
   6 +Snapshot+ nn-tk, developed by Toivo Pedaste, is based on the NN
     newsreader (NN commands should still work). nn-tk provides a GUI
     interface with command menus and buttons, the use of the mouse to
     select articles, a scrolling panel for displaying articles and
     group selection using either of scrolling panel or cascading menus.
     If EXMH is available then there is also an internal editor for
     posting items and the ability to send and read MIME messages (so,
     installing EXMH is recomended).
     
     The latest version is available for anonymous ftp from:
     
     ftp.uwa.edu.au:/pub/nn/contrib/nn-tk.beta.10.tar.Z

IV. Any good debuggers (or debugger front-ends) out there?

   1 An excellent C source-level debugger is gdb 4.13, the GNU debugger.
     gdb may either be used as a stand-alone debugger or nicely
     integrated, from within Emacs itself. It can be found at any
     anonymous ftp GNU archive, see the sites for GNU Emacs (above) .
     
     +Snapshot+ xxgdb is an X front-end to the gdb debugger. Some people
     prefer using gdb through this front-end rather than via the
     command-line. xdbx is an X front-end to the the popular dbx(1)
     debugger; xxgdb, xdbx, etc. are available for ftp from:
     
     ftp://ftp.x.org/R5contrib/xxgdb.108.tar.gz
     
     ftp://bash.cc.keio.ac.jp/pub/mirror/X11-contrib/R5/xxgdb.108.tar.gz
     
     colonsay.dcs.ed.ac.uk:/export/X11R5/Misc-contrib/xdbx
     
     colonsay.dcs.ed.ac.uk:/export/X11R5/Misc-contrib/mxgdb
     
     
   2 +Snapshot+ ups is another source-level C debugger, developed by
     Mark Russell, that runs either under X or Sunview (which is rather
     irrelevant now). It also comes with its own theme song! Ups
     includes a C interpreter which allows you to add fragments of code
     simply by editing them into the source window (the source file
     itself is not modified). This lets you add debugging printf calls
     without recompiling, relinking (or even restarting) the target
     program.
     
     ups is available for ftp from:
     
     ftp.x.org:/R5contrib/ups-2.45.2.tar.Z
     
     The theme-song is available from:
     
     ftp.x.org:/R5contrib/ups-song.au
     
     
   3 tgdb is a GUI front-end for the gdb debugger with similarities to
     commercail debuggers such as Borland's "Turbo debugger" or
     MicroSoft's "CodeView". Some of its features include:
     
        * setting and deleting breakpoints, listing source code,
          displaying variables;
        * direct command line interface to gdb, including command line
          completion, and command history;
        * windows, which display the CPU registers, memory, auto-display
          (watch) variables and expressions, the current stack frames,
          etc.;
        * an assembly dump window, which allows the display of machine
          instructions, scrolling through the application's code and
          debugging at the assembler level (setting/deleting
          breakpoints, single stepping, etc.).
     
     The latest version, 1.1, is available for anonymous ftp from:
     
     ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/devel/debuggers/tgdb-1.1.src.tgz
     
     Pre-built binaries are available from:
     
     ftp://ftp.aud.alcatel.com/tcl/code/tgdb-1.1.src.tgz
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

V. Can anyone suggest any good calendar programs?

There are several popular calendar packages with more features than the
standard calendar client xcalendar.

   1 xcal: calendar with daily alarms and a notebook
     
     +Snapshot+ xcal, written by Peter Collinson, is an interactive
     calendar program. When started xcal displays today's date in a
     small command box on the screen. The date changes at midnight. The
     command box is intended to sit on the screen as a companion to the
     xclock program. A small button in the top level window can be
     pressed to inspect appointments for today. This generates a panel
     showing information from the calendar file for today and
     information from a set of seven daily files holding regular
     commitments. Finally, the memo panel displays and allows the
     editing of a memo file.
     
     
   2 xkal: graphical appointment calendar
     
     +Snapshot+ xkal, developed by George Ferguson, is a graphical
     appointment calendar that allows you to maintain many types of
     reminders (system, personal (with colour-coded criticality
     levels)), displays them in several different formats, and allows
     you to add and edit them. Silent and non-graphic modes are provided
     to allow xkal to be used to check for appointments without
     interaction.
     
     
   3 ical: a calendar manager
     
     ical , developed by Sanjay Ghemawat, is a calendar manager
     featuring:
     
        * appointments or notices that can be easily added or deleted
          and can be made to repeat in various ways;
        * post reminders for upcoming appointments, print and list item
          occurrences;
        * share calendars amongst different users.
     
     Release 1.9 of ical is designed to work with Tcl7.0/Tk3.3 or later.
     If you are using older versions of Tcl/Tk, you will need to
     upgrade.
     
     See the Appendix, for information about obtaining Tcl/Tk. Reading
     the comp.lang.tcl FAQ will also help.
     
     The latest version of ical can be ftp'd from:
     
     ftp.aud.alcatel.com:/tcl/code/ical-1.9.tar.gz
     
     ftp.lcs.mit.edu:/pub/sanjay/common/ical-1.9.tar.Z
     
     
   4 +Snapshot+ calentool: day/week/month/year-at-glance
     
     Calentool, developed by Bill Randle, is a day/week/month/year-
     at-glance tool. It also features recurring appointments (e.g every
     Monday or every 1st & 3rd Tuesday), as well as a reminder of future
     appointments. calentool also permits other user's schedules to be
     accessed and also provides interesting information about the sun
     and moon.
     
     The windowed display interface uses XView (2.X or 3.X) to present
     an Open Look style user interface (including the Help key!).
     
     The latest version of calentool, 2.3X, is available for ftp from:
     
     ftp.x.org:/contrib/office/calentool-2.3.tar.gz
     
     
   5 k-lendars : a multi-user/multi-calendar diary
     
     k-lendars, developed by Jean-Michel Leon, is a
     multi-user/multi-calendar diary with a Motif interface. Multi-user
     functionality, is optional and k-lendars may be used in single-user
     mode with one or more calendars.
     
     Since multi-user communications are email-based, a dispatch
     mechanism such as procmail, slocal , etc. is a necessity.
     
     The latest version, 1.2, is available for ftp at:
     
     ftp://avahi.inria.fr:/pub/k-lendars-1.2.tar.gz
     
     ftp.x.org:/contrib/applications/k-lendars-1.2.tar.gz
     
     
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VI. Are there any (CAD) drawing programs for X?

   1 +Snapshot+ xfig (Facility for Interactive Generation of figures),
     originally written by Supoj Sutanthavibul, is a menu-driven drawing
     program that may be used to draw and manipulate objects
     interactively in an X window. It comes with a translator package
     (transfig, also available at ftp.x.org) that allows xfig drawings
     to be converted to sundry other formats including LaTeX,
     PostScript, PiCTeX, etc. xfig can also import encapsulated
     PostScript files that can be annotated. xfig features primitive
     objects: circles, ellipses, arcs, etc. that may be grouped into
     complex objects and scaled, rotated, and manipulated in various
     ways.
     
     xfig is now maintained by Brian V. Smith (he certainly answers all
     the queries posted); the latest version, 3.0, can be ftp'd from:
     
     ftp.x.org:/contrib/applications/drawing_tools/xfig/xfig.3.0.tar.Z
     
     You also need to get TransFig version 3.0.0. TransFig contains the
     post-processor needed by xfig to convert fig files to one of
     several output formats.
     
     The TransFig package is in:
     
     ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/applications/drawing_tools/transfig/
     
     
   2 tgif , developed by William Chia-Wei Cheng, also features primitive
     objects: circles, ellipses, arcs, etc. that may be grouped into
     complex objects and scaled, rotated, and manipulated in various
     ways. It also supports "building-block" objects that can be made
     part of a library of objects which are stored as Prolog code. tgif
     can also generate PostScript, and xbm (monochrome x-bitmap files)
     compatible output.
     
     Due to the tremendous surge of interest in the World-Wide-Web, tgif
     also supports the retrieval of tgif (obj and sym) files from HTTP
     servers. Hypertext jumps are supported using the old tgif
     teleporting or traveling mechanism (the attribute "href=" is
     recognized in addition to the original ones).
     
     The latest version, 2.16, is available for ftp from:
     
     ftp.x.org:/contrib/applications/tgif/tgif-2.16.tar.Z
     
     ftp://cs.ucla.edu:/pub/tgif/tgif-2.16.tar.Z
     
     
   3 picasso, developed by Frank Mangin, is an interactive drawing tool
     in the style of idraw (idraw is available as part of the Interviews
     toolkit) that implements interactive image rescaling, rotation, and
     color control. It requires Tcl/tk (see the Appendix for information
     on obtaining Tcl/Tk). picasso features:
     
        * greyscale image and Postscript object management;
        * supported image formats include: Postscript, PPM, GIF, Pict,
          XPM, etc.;
        * LaTeX object management and creation;
        * LaTeX picture generation (picasso can generate a latex picture
          mixing postscript drawing and latex objects. The picture is
          resizable at include time using the \epsfsize facility.)
     
     picasso requires that the following packages are installed:
     
        * tcl7.1, tk3.4 and tclX7.1a or later (refer to the appendix for
          details);
        * Jef Poskanzer's PbmPlus package (available for ftp from:
          ftp.x.org:/R5contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z).
          
          
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

VII. Any virtual window managers out there?


The "Virtual Desktop" feature of these window managers effectively makes
your monitor, a window onto a screen that is larger than the physical
limits of the monitor.


   1 fvwm , developed by Robert Nation, seems to be the most ubiquitous
     of the virtual window-managers being used in recent memory
     (especially in the Linux community). It borrows heavily from Tom
     LaStrange's famous twm window manager. (Actually, any
     self-respecting window-manager will borrow from twm since it was
     the first ICCCM-compliant window-manager to be written. It should
     also be noted that Tom LaStrange also wrote the first virtual
     window-manager (swm) for Solbourne Corp. (is this guy brilliant or
     what?))
     
     fvwm is a derivative of twm, redesigned to minimize memory
     consumption, provide a 3-D look (indistinguishable from Motif's
     mwm) and provide a simple virtual desktop.
     
     Versions of fvwm beginning with 1.15 support modules, separate
     programs, which runs as a separate unix process, but transmits
     commands to fvwm to execute.
     
     The latest version of fvwm are available for ftp in:
     
     ftp://spcot.sanders.com/pub/fvwm
     
     
   2 vtwm is a virtual window manager with the look-and-feel of twm. It
     is available for ftp from:
     
     ftp.x.org:/R5contrib/vtwm-5.3.tar.gz
     
     
   3 olvwm, developed by Scott Oaks, is a virtual window manager with
     the look-and-feel of OpenLook (Sun's windowing environment). It is
     available for ftp from:
     
     ftp.x.org:/R5contrib/olvwm4.tar.Z
     
     
   4 piewm, developed by Don Hopkins, is a virtual window manager with
     the look-and-feel of tvtwm, with the additional of pie-shaped
     menus. It is available for ftp from:
     
     ftp.x.org:/R5contrib/piewm.tar.Z
     
     
   5 ctwm, developed by Claude Lecommandeur, is an extension to twm,
     that features up to 32 multiple virtual screens, called workspaces.
     
     You switch from one workspace to another either by clicking on a
     button in an optional panel of buttons (the workspace manager) or
     by invoking a function. Each workspace can be customize by choosing
     different colors, names, and pixmaps for the buttons and root
     windows. It also features:
     
        * optional 3D window titles and border (ala Motif);
        * shaped, colored icons;
        * multiple icons for clients based on the icon name;
        * windows that can belong to several workspaces;
        * a map of your workspaces to quickly move windows between
          different workspaces;
        * icons, root backgrounds and buttons that can be animated;
        * pinnable and sticky menus.
     
     The latest version of ctwm, 3.2, patchlevel 1, is available for ftp
     from:
     
     ftp.x.org:/contrib/window_managers/ctwm-3.2p1.tar.Z

IIX. Project Management Software

Pete Phillips maintains a Project Management Software FAQ that is posted
regularily to comp.software-eng .

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

IX. Where can I find icons?

   1 The xpm-3 distribution has a set of icons available. They may be
     ftp'd from:
     
     ftp.x.org:/R5contrib/xpm3icons.tar.Z
     
     
   2 Anthony's X Icon Library is a large collection of monochrome
     bitmaps and color pixmaps for general use by the X community. These
     icon-images are small (usually less than 100x100 pixels) and can be
     used as:
     
        * program icons for general use by window managers;
        * buttons/widget/gadget images;
        * representing document types for a desktop program (like xdtm),
          wallpaper, landscapes, space ships, objects for games;
        * etc. The latest version, 1.5, is available for ftp from:
     
     ftp.x.org:/R5contrib/AIcons/
     
     
   3 The Really Humungous Library of Icons
   4 Tony's Icon Collection
   5 Erin's Icon Collection
   6 Building Blocks and Icons
   7 Yahoo's Archive of Icons



X. Are there any editors/paint-programs for xpm/GIF/TIFF/etc.
image-formats?

   1 +Snapshot+ xpaint, developed by David Koblas, is a incredibly
     versatile mono-bitmap and/or colour-pixmap editing tool. It
     features, among other things:
     
        * the usual paint operations:
             * Brushes, Spray paint, Pencil;
             * Lines, Arcs, Pattern Fill, Text;
             * Boxes, Circles, Polygons (filled and un-filled);
        * edit multiple images simultaneously and cut/copy/paste between
          them;
        * "Fatbits"/zooming;
        * on-line help facility;
        * built-in font-selector;
        * reading and writing of X11 bitmaps, PPM, GIF, XPM, and TIFF
          image-formats; SGI RGB format (SGI only);
        * writing PostScript;
     
     The latest version, 2.1.1, is available for ftp from:
     ftp://ftp.x.org:/R5contrib/xpaint-2.1.1.tar.Z
     
     
   2 pixmap, developed by Lionel Mallet, is an editor for XPM version
     3.4 pixmap-format files, derived from Davor Matic's bitmap editor.
     It can be optionally be compiled with a Motif interface.
     
     The latest version, 2.6, is available for ftp from:
     
     ftp://ftp.x.org:/contrib/applications/pixmap/pixmap2.6.tar.gz
     
     ftp://avahi.inria.fr:/pub/pixmap/pixmap2.6.tar.gz
     
     

XI. Are there any apps that can display files in parallel, highlighting
(in color) the differences between them?

   1 +Snapshot+ ediff, developed by Michael Kifer, is a visual interface
     to diff and patch , accessed within emacs, that highlights the
     differences between two files in color.
     
     Not only does ediff highlight (in different colors) differences
     between regions but it also highlights differences within the
     region (i.e. sub-regions). The two files being compared, can be
     viewed side-by-side (windows split vertically), one-over-the-other
     (windows split horizontally) or in separate windows (frames).
     Either of the files can be patched with the differences of the
     other, and old differences can also be recovered.
     
     Ediff is part of the standard emacs and xemacs distribution.
     
     
   2 mgdiff, developed by Daniel Williams, is a graphical front-end to
     diff . When the user selects two files for comparison, it runs the
     diff command, parses the output and presents the results
     graphically. This presentation can also be used to generate a
     user-specified merge of the two files into a third file.
     
     This program's appearance is based upon a program called gdiff,
     available for Silicon Graphics workstations.
     
     The latest version of mgdiff is available for anonymous ftp at:
     
     ftp://ftp.x.org:/pub/R6untarred/contrib/Motif/mgdiff
     
     
   3 +Snapshot+ tkdiff, developed by John Klassa, is a graphical
     front-end for the standard Unix diff utility. Its features include:
        * Highlighted difference regions;
        * side-by-side viewing of files;
        * linked (synchronized) scrolling of the two files;
        * random access to difference regions. The latest version,
     1.0b5, is available for anonymous ftp at:
     
     ftp://ftp.aud.alcatel.com/tcl/code/tkdiff-1.0b5.tar.gz

Appendix

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Obtaining Tcl/Tk
Tcl and Tk were developed by John Ousterhout, Sun Microsystems.

Tcl stands for "tool command language" and is pronounced "tickle". Tcl
is actually two things: a language and a library. Tcl is a simple
textual language, intended primarily for issuing commands to interactive
programs such as text editors, debuggers, illustrators, and shells; it
can also be used as a library package embedded in application programs.

Tk is an extension to Tcl which provides an interface to the X. Note
that many users will encounter Tk via "wish", a simple windowing shell
which permits the user to write Tcl applications interactively.

The latest versions of Tcl/Tk can be obtained via anonymous ftp from:

ftp://ftp.aud.alcatel.com/tcl/ftp.cs.berkeley.edu

ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/tcl/

The definitive archive of Tcl/Tk applications and packages is at:

ftp://ftp.aud.alcatel.com/tcl/code

     arranged them in a (hopefully) visually pleasing collage and
     detrimentally added to the access-time when this FAQ is retrieved
     via the Web.

Version 1 Release 1 of this FAQ, was created entirely from within GNU
Emacs 19.23> (on a lazy Sunday afternoon, sometime in July '94 (on a
VT100-terminal yet!)). GNUS was used to access relevant USENET FAQ's in
news.answers and the ange-ftp and crypt++ packages made it possible to
visit the README's of the various packages mentioned, at ftp sites
around the world, after searching for them with archie (from within
emacs, of course).

The hyper-FAQ (Release 1.8) was generated from the original text-version
using Emacs' massively useful macro-facility (and thus the conversion
was painlessly automated) and the html-mode package.

The plain-text version of this FAQ is now generated from the hyper-FAQ,
with the html-to-ascii perl-script written by James R. Davis.

The text version of this FAQ is posted to comp.windows.x.apps and
uploaded to the archive on or about the 15th of every month. Additions,
corrections, criticisms and suggestions are welcome and encouraged;
please email them to the maintainer of this FAQ: <elf@ee.ryerson.ca>.
