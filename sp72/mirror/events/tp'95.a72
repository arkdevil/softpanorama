TOOLS returns to Melbourne for the third time and continues the 
commitment to excellence demonstrated by earlier conference in 
Europe, US and the Pacific.  Standards established for TOOLS by 
earlier conferences in the series include:

.   Emphasis on the practice of object-oriented technology and its 
    application in  industrial environments, complementing the more 
    academically oriented   perspective of traditional conferences.

.   Solid technical program, based on a strict refereeing process.

.   Balanced coverage of the wealth of approaches, trends and 
    variants in the object-oriented community.

.   Combination of tutorials by recognised experts, up-to-date 
    exhibitions of  products and services, invited talks by innovators in 
    the fields, relevant panel  discussions, and technical papers 
    targeted to industry practitioners.

TOOLS Pacific '95 is now soliciting papers on all aspects of object-
oriented technology.  All submitted papers will be refereed and 
judged not only according to standards of technical quality but also 
on their usefulness to practitioners and applied researchers.

This year a complete day will be devoted to specialized language 
track in C++, Smalltalk and Eiffel, culminating in a language debate. 
Theoretical and practical papers representing lessons of experience 
on these topics are especially sought.

As with previous conferences, the TOOLS 18 Proceedings will be 
published by Prentice-Hall and made available worldwide.


A non-exhaustive list of suggested topics include:
.   Reports on experienced with O-O technology
.   Migration towards O-O software development
.   O-O user interfaces, persistence and databases
.   Class management and evolution
.   Empirical and field studies
.   Production, distribution and revenue collection of industrial-
    quality reusable components.

TOOLS 18 will feature a special track on issues relating to the 
migration from conventional to object-oriented programming.  This 
track will include workshop(s), tutorials, panel discussions, and 
featured speakers.  Technical papers are expressly sought in this 
area.

Paper should range from 10 to 20 double spaced pages.  Six copies of 
each submission should be sent to:

INTERNATIONAL OBJECT-ORIENTED WEEK

Friday, December 1, 1995, has been set aside for independently 
organized events, such as User Group meetings or standardization 
committees.  The TOOLS Pacific '95 organizer will help coordinate 
such events if they fall within the scope of object-oriented 
techniques, and will include the announcements in the final TOOLS 
program.  If you are interested in setting up such a meeting, please 
contact the conference chair for details at tools@monash.edu.au.
