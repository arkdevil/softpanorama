KL-ZIP is a GUI interface for the shareware/public domain programs ZIP.EXE 
and UNZIP.EXE for OS/2.  KL-ZIP will NOT work properly with PKZIP or 
PKUNZIP!  This is a 'WORK IN PROGRESS'!!  I wanted to post this early beta
so that I can begin to get feedback.  Currently KL-ZIP ONLY supports viewing
ZIP files and extracting ZIP files. KL-ZIP is designed to fully exploit 
OS/2's capabilities. KL-ZIP supports HPFS long file names. For readability 
KL-ZIP substitutes a '|' character whenever a SPACE is encountered in a 
HPFS filename. This may be changed in a future version. I currently plan on
posting all new versions on OS/2 Shareware BBS at 703-385-4325. I call there
about once a week. You may contact me via messages there. 
As soon as I get some preliminary ZIP creation capabilities working I will 
work on some docs and help files. Please be patient. The final version of 
KL-ZIP is expected to be shareware and carry a $15-$25 registration fee.

The final Shareware version will NOT support HPFS long files names or
loading filenames via ASSOCIATIONS unless it is registered! Other 
restrictions may also apply to unregistered copies! Registration enabled
features will be pulled by the end of 1993! If you like what you see during
development you can get a pre-release registration special for only $5.00!!
After initial release registration will be $15-$25.

To contact me it is best to leave me, Keith Luken, messages on OS/2 Shareware
BBS or you may fax me at 404-984-5484.

To get the pre-release registration special send $5.00 in check or
money order to:

Keith Luken
3930 Shoemaker Court
Marietta, Georgia   30062

You will be sent you registration number for use when official
version ships near the end of 1993! The registration panel in the current
beta does not do anything at present time.

Current beta copies will expire 2/1/94. If the official version
is not ready by then, a beta with an extended expiration date
will be released!


Future Plans for releases 1.xx:
    - Add drive(s) .ZIP scan feature
    - Ability to add comments to zip being created.
    - Ability to delete individual file(s) from a ZIP.   *** DONE ***

Wish list for possible release 2.xx:
    - Full support of PKZIP, PKUNZIP 2.xx for OS/2 (when available)
    - Support for McAfee's OS/2 SCAN virus checker
    - Full added support for LHARC maybe other OS/2 compression programs



Known bugs:
___________

- In create ZIP, file list has limitations that will cause files not to
    show. This is an OS/2 limitation and under normal circumstances
    you will never see it unless you have several thousand files in
    a directory! This limitation will apply to any LIST BOX in this
    and any other OS/2 program!!

0.01  First Beta  10/31/93
__________________________

- First initial beta, many quirky bugs

 
0.02 11/1/93
_____________

- Fixed errors on inital install run
  should default right into config.
- All Extract options and Viewer options
  appear to be working
- Unless there are major bugs with this beta,
  next beta will be in 2 weeks with some CREATE
  options added!

0.03 11/2/93
____________

- Fixed cosmetic bugs in ZIP file list when EAs exist.

0.04 11/3/93
____________

- Fixed first tagged file not being extracted when EXTRACT SELECTED


0.05 11/14/93
_____________

- Fixed some cosmetic bugs 

0.06 11/21/93
_____________

- Added UNINSTALL option on main menu to remove all KL ZIP entries in
  OS/2 INI files.
- Fixed incorrect filename being selected when ASSOCIATION set
- Added most of the CREATE ZIP screens and features, but actual ZIP is
  NOT created yet. Should be ready in about a week!
- Reports of some strange problems on inital use if you do not exit
  program after saving inital config. Until I track this one down
  after you config it the first time EXIT all the way out and then restart it.

0.07 11/25/93
_____________

- Added Menu item under Actions to View Comment if one exists
- Added accelerator key functions to all menus
- Added current ZIP file Date/time to screen
- CREATE ZIP now works!! ** WARNING - It has not been completely
    tested yet and does not have any validity or error checking
    code added yet! Use it with caution!!

0.08 11/28/93
_____________

- IF Create ZIP fails then option to view result log will be displayed
    Option to remove failed result log is also given
- Added Delete Selected to be able to DELETE file(s) from an existing ZIP
- Rewrote some code for better error handling in Extract Selected
- Added Error handling to cover most errors that could be encountered
    throughout the program, particularly when invoking ZIP or UNZIP

0.09 11/29/93
_____________

- Changed way Extract directory is selected, now has pull down lists, to
    allow for easier changing and flexibility!!
- Think I finally fixed a bug with viewing ZIP files if the ZT## temp
    directory was under an HPFS long file name directort tree.
- When program ends normally if it detects an error log it will ask if you
    want to erase it. Saying NO prvents the ZT## temp directory from being
    deleted. This may be handy to see why a certain action may have failed!
- Fixed bug when deleting selected files from ZIP if they were HPFS long
    file names.
- Fixed bug in Error Log handler if error was returned during delete selected
- Fixed bug when creating ZIP the default directory selected should have been
    the current directory, but was actually the parent directory

0.10 12/01/93
_____________

- Fixed bug with error log file ZIPLOG.TXT not being properly deleted
    from temp directory
- Fixed bug where it was NOT properly finding an already existing ZIP if
    you tried to create it.
- Added FILE DELETE option to File Menu on Create Zip Screen (this allows
    you to do some file maintenance while in KL-ZIP!)
** AS holidays approach I will be VERY BUSY! May be a few weeks between
    betas at times until after 1/1/94. Only missing 2 major planned features
    for version 1.00 before release (see above)
