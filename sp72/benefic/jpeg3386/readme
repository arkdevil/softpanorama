The Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software
==========================================

This distribution contains MS-DOS executable copies of version 3 of the
Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG software.  You are welcome to redistribute
this software and to use it for any purpose, subject to the conditions under
LEGAL ISSUES, below.

This version of the software runs ONLY on MS-DOS machines with 386 or 486
CPUs.  It is compiled to use 386 32-bit instructions, and it usually runs as
much as twice as fast as the regular 16-bit DOS version.  A minimum of 1.5 MB
of extended memory is recommended; if you have too little extended memory,
excessive swapping will occur, and then this version may be no faster than the
regular version.

For usage instructions, see the file USAGE.

Please report any problems with this software to jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.


ABOUT JPEG FILE FORMATS
=======================

CAUTION: Handmade Software's shareware PC program GIF2JPG produces files that
are totally incompatible with our programs (and everyone else's too).  They
use a proprietary format that is an amalgam of GIF and JPEG representations.
However, you can force GIF2JPG to produce compatible files with its -j switch,
and their decompression program JPG2GIF can read our files (at least ones
produced with our default option settings).

The file format we have adopted is called JFIF.  This format has been agreed
to by a number of major commercial JPEG vendors, and we expect that it will
become the de facto standard.  JFIF is a minimal representation; work is also
going forward to incorporate JPEG compression into the TIFF standard, for use
in "high end" applications that need to record a lot of additional data about
an image.  We intend to support JPEG-in-TIFF in the future.  We hope that
these two formats will be sufficient and that other, incompatible JPEG file
formats will not proliferate.

Indeed, part of the reason for developing and releasing this free software is
to help force rapid convergence to de facto standards for JPEG file formats.
SUPPORT STANDARD, NON-PROPRIETARY FORMATS: demand JFIF or JPEG-in-TIFF!

SOURCE CODE
===========

The source code from which this software was generated is freely available.
The "official" archive site for the source code is ftp.uu.net (Internet
address 137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  The most recent released version can
always be found there in directory graphics/jpeg.  This particular version is
jpegsrc.v3.tar.Z.  If you are on the Internet, you can retrieve files from
UUNET by anonymous FTP.  If you don't have FTP access, UUNET's archives are
also available via UUCP; contact postmaster@uunet.uu.net for information on
retrieving files that way.

You can also obtain the source code from CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum
(GO PICS), library 10; this version is in file jpsrc3.zip.

You are welcome to use the source code in other JPEG-related programs.
The conditions for doing so may be found in LEGAL ISSUES, above.

The executables in this package were compiled directly from the distributed
sources, using Intel's 386/486 C Code Builder (TM) 32-bit compiler.  (Thanks
to Bryan Dawson of Intel for preparing these files.)  The user interface
files, jcmain.c and jdmain.c, have been modified to provide more DOS-friendly
behavior.  The DOS versions are included in this package, in case you'd like
to modify them further.  (You'll need to get the remaining 900K of source code
before you can do much, though.)
