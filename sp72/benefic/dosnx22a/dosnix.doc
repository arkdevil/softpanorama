	  DOSNIX.DOC (this file) has been keyed for use with MAN.BAT and
	VF.  For on-line help merely type "man" and the name of the 
	subject	with which you want help.  To search for subjects while in 
	VF, begin the search string with a ~ (tilde).
 
	  For help from anywhere on your system, VF.EXE and MAN.BAT 
	should 	be in a directory pointed to by the PATH command and you 
	should put the full path name for DOSNIX.DOC in MAN.BAT.  For 
	example: 

			VF +\~%1 C:\DOSNIX\DOSNIX.DOC

        DOSNIX is a collection of UNIX style file management and text
    utilities which will increase the power and flexibility of your
    system.  DOSNIX provides many of the features which UNIX users
    take for granted along with some features not even found on UNIX
    systems.  It is not a UNIX clone but it is very compatible with UNIX 
    conventions.  Users who are familiar with UNIX will have no trouble
    learning DOSNIX.  Other users may find DOSNIX a good tool for learning 
    UNIX.  Some of the programs included with DOSNIX are:


    CHMOD -    This version of the UNIX CHMOD command has been adapted
             to work with MSDOS file attributes.  It will allow you
             to change the attributes of any file and allow you to
             create read only, hidden and system files.

    CLR -      A utility which will allow you to customize your screen 
	     colors from the command line.  CLR will work properly with or
	     without ANSI.SYS.

    CP -       The UNIX counterpart of the DOS COPY command.  CP will
             allow you to copy hidden and system files, and the DOSNIX
             version will not overwrite existing files without warning
             you.  CP can handle wild cards and multiple arguments and
	     will even allow you to format a new floppy disk if the first
	     one gets filled up.  CP also has options to utilize the archive 
	     bit or to copy files interactively.

    DB -       The famous "delete but" command will delete all except
             specified files.  This command is not UNIX but it is a
             great tool for cleaning up around ZIP, ARC and other archive
             files.

    EDC -      Easy Directory Change.  This utility will allow you to
	     change directories without typing out long path names.
	     EDC can also be used to display a visual directory tree
	     on your screen.

    FFIND -    FFIND is a file locator in the tradition of the UNIX FIND
             command.  Although FFIND does not have the power and scope
             of the UNIX version, it is much easier to use.  FFIND will
             locate files on any drive and will accept wild cards.  It
             will also locate hidden and system files and has options
             to remove unwanted files.





    LS -       The venerable UNIX directory lister.  LS has been spruced 
	     up and given another sort and two new display modes.  LS will 
	     now display directories sorted by file size as well as name, 
	     extension or date.  LS can list files in one, two, four or five 
	     column formats, sorted by row or by column, and offers a choice 
	     of upper or lower case output.  LS also offers reverse sorting
	     and a choice of switch characters. Default options can be set 
	     from the environment.


    MV -       A fast powerful file mover, MV is used to relocate files
             without performing separate COPY and  DEL commands.  MV can
             be used to move files to any directory or to any drive.

    MVDIR -    The UNIX directory move utility.  MVDIR will relocate
	     complete directory trees and this version will even
	     move them to another drive.

    RM -       More powerful than the DOS DEL command, this utility
             will remove complete directory structures and is great
             for erasing floppies.  Unlike some UNIX versions, RM
             will warn you before doing anything drastic.

    VF -       A full featured text file viewer which can recognize VI  
	     commands.  VF can handle extended text modes such as 80 X 30,
	     80 X 60 and even 132 column modes.


        DOSNIX also includes versions of the CAT, TEE and TOUCH commands.




~general


    INSTALLING DOSNIX:

	  DOSNIX is intended primarily for hard drives although	individual 
	DOSNIX utilities can be copied to a floppy disk.  To install DOSNIX 
	on your hard drive you can copy the files to any convenient directory,
	such as C:\DOSNIX and add the directory to the PATH statement in your
        AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  If you don't have an AUTOEXEC.BAT file you can 
	make one with the following two lines:

                        PATH = C:;C:\DOSNIX
                        PROMPT $P$G

	This will get you up and running with DOSNIX.


    DOSNIX OPTIONS:

	  Most DOSNIX commands have a simple format which can be enhanced by 
	the use of UNIX style option strings.  The option string is always 
	the first argument after the command and usually begins with a "-".  
	See the Command Summary for the options available with each command.

	  If you are used to MSDOS switches and find this awkward you can 
	insert the following line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

		SET SWITCH=/     (No space before or after "=")

	All commands except CHMOD and VF will then recognize a "/" as an 
	option delimiter.  If you don't use this feature, you can use slashes 
	in path names, as in UNIX, and they will be converted to back slashes.



    INSTANT HELP:

	  This document has now been keyed for quick command searches and
	a HELP.BAT file has been included.  To obtain on-line help, type 
	"help" and the name of the subject with which you want help.  In
	addition, a brief summary of most commands can be obtained by typing 
	the name of the command followed by a "-?". 






    USING DOSNIX:

	  DOSNIX is based on UNIX although the author has simplified some 
	commands and enhanced others.  Other commands have been modified
	slightly to make them more compatible with MSDOS. If you are familiar 
	with UNIX you should have no problem with DOSNIX. If you are not 
	familiar with UNIX, books on the subject are available in most book 
	stores.  My own personal favorite, if you can still find it, is:

			    UNIX SYSTEM V PRIMER
			    Waite, Martin & Pratha
			    Howard W. Sams & Co., Inc.

	This book offers a lightly humorous treatment of UNIX and much of it 
	is applicable to DOSNIX.

	  DOSNIX has a great many options and features, which can be 
	bewildering to the novice user.  Pick out the commands and options 
	you need the most and get familiar with them before moving on.  LS 
	is a great directory lister and it is a lot fun to play around with, 
	but the -l option is all most people  will ever need.  The same is 
	true with other commands. The options are there if you need them but 
	don't feel you need to learn every one.

	  You can experiment with DOSNIX by making a scratch directory or 
	floppy and playing around with different commands. This procedure is 
	highly recommended for destructive commands such as RM and DB.


    COMPATIBILITY:

	  DOSNIX was written and tested using an XT clone with Phoenix BIOS 
	and MSDOS 3.1 and 3.3.  It was written very conservatively and should 
	be upwardly compatible with with MSDOS 4.x, 5.x and most AT and 386
	class machines.  Compatibility with MSDOS 2.x is not guaranteed.
	Some utilities, such as VF and CLR, use BIOS level screen and 
	keyboard functions and require an IBM compatible BIOS.  Because all 
	utilities use small or medium memory models, they should not require 
	more than 256k of memory to run.

	MSDOS is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation.


 
~stdin  ~stdout


    		STANDARD INPUT (STDIN) AND STANDARD OUTPUT (STDOUT)


	  DOSNIX utilities make extensive use of STDIN and STDOUT.  STDIN
	is the keyboard unless you decide to redirect it.  STDOUT is the
	screen unless you decide to redirect it.  Redirection is done by
	using the MSDOS operators; <, >, >> and |.

	< 	used with a program that normally reads from STDIN.  It 
		tells MSDOS to use the contents of a file for STDIN.
		For example: 

			more < dosnix.doc

		  
	>	writes STDOUT to a file.  For example:

			cat dosnix.doc

		writes DOSNIX.DOC to the screen, while

			cat dosnix.doc > another.doc

		copies DOSNIX.DOC to ANOTHER.DOC.


	>>	appends STDOUT to an existing file or writes STDOUT
		to a new file.  For example:

			cat quickref.doc >> dosnix.doc

		appends QUICKREF.DOC to DOSNIX.DOC.  Unfortunately
		this operator will leave an unwanted CTRL-Z between
		the two files.  For this reason, DOSNIX includes an 
		APP command.


	|	The pipeline operator. Uses STDOUT as STDIN for a
		second program.  For example:

			cat *.doc | vf

		pipes all files with an extension of .DOC to VF.



	  UNIX and DOSNIX provide an additional command, TEE, which
	will write STDOUT to the screen and store it in a file at
	the same time.  For example:

			cat dosnix.doc | tee another.doc

	writes DOSNIX.DOC to the screen and stores it in ANOTHER.DOC.

                        SUMMARY OF DOSNIX COMMANDS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~app


    NAME:

	APP     Append standard input to file.


    SYNTAX:

	app  file1 [file2..file5]               Appends standard input to up 
						to five files.



    DESCRIPTION:

	  APP is a non-UNIX command meant to replace the DOS ">>" operator.  
	Using ">>" to append files will not remove the CTRL-Z from the end of 
	the first file before appending, but using APP will.  APP can be  used
	with the dos "|" operator and any command which writes to standard 
	output.  For example:

                cat file1 file2 | app file3

	appends the output of CAT to file3.  See CAT.

                app < file1 file2     

	appends file1 to file2.

	WARNING:  Do not use "app < file1 > file2".  This will erase file2.

	APP is meant for use with text files only and use with binary files 
	is not recommended.



~cat


    NAME:

	CAT     Copy text file(s) to standard output.


    SYNTAX:


	cat                             Copies standard input to standard 
					output.

	cat file1                       Copies file1 to standard output. 
					Usually the screen.

	cat file1 file2 > file3         Concatenates file1 and file2 and 
					stores in file3.




    DESCRIPTION:

	  CAT reads one or more files and copies them to STDOUT.  If no input 
	file is given, CAT will read STDIN until a CTRL-Z is found.  For 
	example:

                        cat *.c > csource.txt

	will concatenate all files with an extension of .C and store
	them in CSOURCE.TXT.

                        cat file1 file2 | app file3

	concatenates file1 and file2 and appends the result to file3.

                        cat > temp

	stores whatever is typed on the keyboard in TEMP and is similar to the 
	DOS command COPY CON TEMP.  CTRL-Z can be used to terminate this 
	operation.

	Some versions of CAT will copy the CTRL-Z at the end of	each file, 
	leaving you stuck with a lot of unwanted CTRL-Z's in your new file.  
	This version wont.

	CAT is meant for use with text files only and use with binary files 
	is not recommended.



~chmod


    NAME:

	CHMOD   Change attribute(s) of a file.


    SYNTAX:

	chmod [+x] file1                Adds attribute x to file1

	chmod [-x] file1                Removes attribute x from file1



    ATTRIBUTES:

	+a                              Set archive bit.
	-a                              Clear archive bit.
	+h                              Add hidden attribute.
	-h                              Remove hidden attribute.
	+r                              Add read only attribute.
	-r                              Remove read only attribute.
	+s                              Add system attribute.
	-s                              Remove system attribute.



    DESCRIPTION:

	  CHMOD is used to modify the attributes of a file.  Attributes can 
	be grouped together in any sequence but each attribute must be 
	preceded by a "+" or a  "-".  For example:

                        chmod -a *.*

	removes the archive bit from all files in the current directory,

                        chmod -a+r list.txt

	removes the archive bit and makes LIST.TXT read only,

                        chmod +h+s widget.com

	makes WIDGET.COM a hidden, system file.



~clr


    NAME:

	CLR   Set foreground, background and border colors.



    SYNTAX:

	clr				Clears screen without resetting 
					attributes.

	clr [-ab] fgnd [bkgnd [brdr]]   Sets screen foreground, background
					and border colors.


    OPTIONS:

		
	a		ANSI compatible mode.
                
	b               Set foreground Bold attribute to ON.



    DESCRIPTION:

	  CLR sets the screen foreground, background and border colors to 
	those specified by the user.  The following colors are supported:

		BLACK   RED     GREEN   YELLOW  AMBER

		BLUE    MAGENTA CYAN    WHITE

	Because yellow is high intensity amber, it is impossible to have a 
	yellow background.  Border colors will vary with the type of monitor.

	  If only a foreground color is specified the background color 
	defaults to black.  The border color always defaults to the background 
	color.  To change the background color you need to specify the 
	foreground color.  To change the border color you need to specify 
	foreground and background colors.

	  For ease of use CLR will recognize the first three letters of any 
	color name.  For example:

                        clr yel

	sets the foreground color to yellow with a black background and border,

                        clr whi blu

	sets the foreground color to white and the background and border 
	colors to blue, and

                        clr red whi red

	sets the foreground color to red, the background color to white and 
	the border color to red.





	  The -b option sets the intensity of the foreground color to high.  
	For example:

                        clr -b red

	sets the foreground color to high intensity red.

	  If the screen is cleared after using CLR, and ANSI.SYS is not 
	installed, the screen will return to normal. This can be avoided by 
	using CLR without arguments to clear the screen, or by installing 
	ANSI.SYS.

	  If ANSI.SYS is installed, CLR will detect it and generate the needed 
	escape codes.  A -a option has been provided to force ANSI mode if 
	needed.  




~cp


    NAME:

	CP      Copy file to new file or directory.



    SYNTAX:

	cp [-abcfinopstv] file1 file2    Copies file1 to file2


        cp [-abcfinopstv] file1 [file2..filen] dir

					Copies any number of files to 
					directory.

        cp [-abcfinopstv] dir1 dir2      Copies files in dir1 to dir2.

	cp -m source dest1 [dest2..destn]

          				Makes multiple copies of source.
					Destination may  be  either file or
					directory.


    OPTIONS:

	a               Copy hidden and system files.  Prompt
                        before overwriting protected files.
        b               Copy only files with archive bit set.
        c               Clear archive bits after copying.
        f               Copy hidden and system files.  Overwrite
                        protected files without prompting.
        i               Interactive mode. Prompts before copying.
        m               Make multiple copies of single file.
        n               No delete. Do not overwrite existing files.
        o               Overwrite existing files without prompting.
                        Does not overwrite protected files.
        p               Preserve file attributes when copying.
        s               Copy files without echoing to screen.
        t               Update file time and date when copying.
        v               Verify files when copying.



    DESCRIPTION:

	  CP copies one or more files to a new file or directory. If more 
	than one source file is specified or wildcards are used, the last  
	argument must specify an existing directory or an error  will  occur. 
	If a directory is used as a source, all files in the directory will 
	be copied but subdirectories will not be copied.






	  Each file is echoed to the screen as it is copied and existing  
	files  are not overwritten  without prompting.  If an existing file 
	is protected the user will be notified and prompted a second time 
	before the file is overwritten. Options are provided to override 
	these features when desired.

	  If a Disk Full error occurs while copying files to a removable 
	device, CP will prompt the user for a new diskette.  The user may 
	either continue, format a new disk or abort at this point.  If a new 
	disk is inserted, CP will create the directory if needed. To format 
	disks, CP needs	to access COMMAND.COM and FORMAT.COM, so set COMSPEC 
	to point to your copy of COMMAND.COM and make sure FORMAT.COM is in a 
	directory pointed to by PATH.

	  The -i option will prompt the user for a yes or no answer before 
	copying each file.  Used with wildcards or directory names this option 
	provides an interactive method of copying files.

	  Hidden and system files can be copied using the -a option or the 
	-f option.  If the -f option is used all existing files, even 
	protected files, will be overwritten without prompting the user.

	  The -o option can be used overwrite existing files but will not 
	overwrite protected files.  If the -n option is used, no files will 
	be overwritten and the user will not be prompted.  The -n option 
	overrides all other options in this respect.

	  If the -s option is used, files will not be echoed to the screen 
	when copying.  This option can be used with the -o, -f or -n options 
	when no screen output is desired.

	  Unlike the MV command, file attributes are not carried over and
	the archive bit of the new file is set. The -p option can be used 
	to preserve the attributes of the old file.

	  In normal use CP will carry over the time and date of the old
	file.  If the -t option is used, the new file will be stamped
	with the current DOS time and date.

	  A -v option has been added to turn on the DOS verify flag before
	copying.  When the copy is complete the verify flag is restored
	to its former state.






	  CP can be used for backups with the -b option.  When this option 
	is used, only  archive files are copied.  The -c option will clear 
	the archive bit on both files after the copy is made.  For example:

			cp -bco *.* a:\

	copies only files in the current directory which have not been backed 
	up.  The archive bits are cleared and any previously existing files 
	on drive A are overwritten.

	  Sometimes it is  necessary to  copy a  file to  several different 
	drives or directories.  CP can be used with the  -m option to make 
	as many copies of a file as needed.



~cpdir


    NAME:

	CPDIR   copy directory and all subdirectories.



    SYNTAX:

	cpdir [-abcfnopstv] dir1 dir2    Copies dir1 to dir2.


    OPTIONS:

            a               Copy hidden and system files.  Prompt
                            before overwriting protected files.
            b               Copy only files with archive bit set.
            c               Clear archive bits after copying.
            f               Copy hidden and system files.  Overwrite
                            protected files without prompting.
            n               No delete. Do not overwrite existing files.
            o               Overwrite existing files without prompting.
                            Does not overwrite protected files.
            p               Preserve file attributes when copying.
            s               Copy files without echoing to screen.
            t               Update file time and date when copying.
            v               Verify files when copying.



    DESCRIPTION:

	  CPDIR copies a complete directory to either a new or existing
	directory.  If the target directory does not exist a new directory 
	will be created.  If the target directory does exist it will be used 
	as the starting point. Note the difference between this and the MVDIR 
	command.  Subdirectories will be created when the files are copied.


	  Options are identical to the the CP command with the exception
	of the -i and -m options which are not used.

	  If a Disk Full error occurs while copying files to a floppy disk,
	CPDIR will prompt the user for a new diskette.  The user may either 
	continue, format a new disk or abort at this point.  To format disks, 
	CP needs to access COMMAND.COM and FORMAT.COM, so set COMSPEC to point
	to your copy of COMMAND.COM and make sure FORMAT.COM is in a directory 
	pointed to by PATH.  When the new diskette is formatted, CPDIR will 
	create all the necessary directories and continue.





~db


    NAME:

	DB      Delete all files except specified files.


    SYNTAX:

	db file1..filen                 Deletes all files in directory
                                                except specified files.


    OPTIONS:        None



    DESCRIPTION:

	  DB will delete all files in a directory except the files given as 
	an argument.  Wildcards can be used in arguments but path names are 
	not supported.  DB can only be used in the current directory.  For 
	example:

                        db *.zip

	will delete all files that do not have an extension of .ZIP and, 
	in fact, DB is an excellent tool for cleaning up around ZIP files 
	and other archives.

	  DB works by assigning a +h attribute to the specified files and 
	then removing all normal files.  The remaining files are then 
	"unhidden".  This can cause a problem  with previously existing 
	hidden files.  If DB encounters any hidden files it, will safely 
	abort leaving the directory unchanged.  You will then have to use RM.

        WARNING: DB can be a deadly weapon if used carelessly.  Use it only 
	when you are sure of what you are doing.




~df


    NAME:

	DF          Report free space remaining on disk.



    SYNTAX:

	df [-i] [drive]				Displays free space on disk.


    OPTIONS:
    
	i  Display additional information.
        ?  Display this screen.



    DESCRIPTION:

	  DF displays the amount of free space left on the disk in clusters
	and bytes.  If no drive is specified, information for the current 
	drive will be displayed.  Using *: as a drive spec causes all drives 
	to be checked.  The -i option displays additional information from 
	the File Address Table.


		
~du



    NAME:

        DU	Report amount of disk space used.



    SYNTAX:

		du [-124abcikns] [dir]	Reports disk space used by dir.
		du [-124bckns] file      Reports disk space used by file.



    OPTIONS:    -1  Report disk usage in 1k blocks.
		-2  Report disk usage in 2k blocks.
		-4  Report disk usage in 4k blocks.
		-a  Show files as well as directory totals.
		-b  Report disk usage in bytes.
		-c  Report disk usage in clusters.
		-i  Ignore subdirectories.
		-n  Display output in lower case.
		-s  Summary mode.  Show only total for directory.
		-?  Display help screen.


    DESCRIPTION:

	  DU reports the amount of disk space used by a directory in 512
	byte blocks.  The amount of space used by each subdirectory is 
	included in the total for the parent directory.  Totals for each 
	subdirectory are also displayed unless the -s option is used.  If 
	no directory is specified DU will use the current directory.  If the
	-i option is used DU will ignore any subdirectories and display just 
	a total	for the parent directory.  The -a option will display the 
	space used by each file.

	  DU will also accept a file name or mask as an argument and the
	current directory will be examined.  For example 

			du *.c

	will display the space used by each ".C" file in the current dir-
	ectory.  In this mode the -a and -i options are assumed.

	  In many cases 512 byte blocks are not very useful so this version
	of DU has options to display the space used in 1k, 2k, or 4k blocks.
	If the -c option is used, cluster size will be determined from the
	FAT and usage will be displayed in clusters.   A -b option has been
	added to display usage in bytes. 



~edc


    NAME:

	EDC	Easy Directory Change


    SYNTAX:

	edc [-options] [d:]dir1			Changes directory to dir1.
	edc -rn dir1 dir2			Renames dir1 to dir2.


    OPTIONS:

	k	Do not pause when screen is full.
	l	Scan drive and list directories.
	m	Create directory and update path file.
	n	Display directory tree without graphics.
	q	Quick scan.  Do not look for extensions.
	r	Remove directory and update path file.
	rn	Rename directory and update path file.
	s	Scan drive. No screen output.
	t	Display directory tree with graphics.
	?	Display help screen.



    DESCRIPTION:

	  EDC allows you to change directories by entering only the directory 
	name rather than the whole path name.  For example, if you have a 
	directory  named \MODEM\FILES\ZIP you can reach the directory 
	from anywhere on your drive by entering:

			edc zip

	instead of:

			cd \modem\files\zip

	EDC can also find directories if given just the first few letters of  
	the name.  If  you  have a directory named \GAMES\POKER\BIGDECK, 
	entering:

			edc big

	will  find it.

    	  If  EDC finds  more than one directory with the same name, it 
	will display all directories found and  prompt you  to choose one.
	A new menu has been installed with both a selector bar and a speed
        search feature.  To use speed search, enter the next letter of the
	directory name to narrow the search or use the backspace key to
	widen the search.





	  EDC will locate directories on any hard drive without using a 
	drive spec.  To change to a directory on a floppy  drive, or just
	to speed things up, you can enter the drive spec along with the 
	directory name with no space or slash between them.  For example 
	if you are currently using drive C and you wish to change to 
	B:\GAMES\BOARD\CHECKERS you can enter:

			edc b:checkers
		or

			edc b:check

	A drive spec can be terminated by a semicolon as well as a colon.
	This allows you to change drives without hitting the shift key.
	For example:

			edc b;check


	  To install EDC, copy EDC.EXE to the root directory of your boot 
	drive or to any directory pointed  to by the DOS PATH parameter. 
	Then enter:

			edc -s

   	EDC will scan all hard drives for directories and store	them in  
	a file named PATH.EDC which is maintained in the root directory of
	drive C.  Because EDC refers to this file to find directories, 
	it should not be removed.  To scan floppy drives you can enter:

			edc -s d:

	where "d" is the letter of the drive you are scanning. 


	   If EDC does not find a copy of PATH.EDC when changing directories,
	it will automatically scan the drive for you.  The -s option can 
	be used for updates.  You can lock out undesired drives by setting 
	the environment	variable EDNOSCAN to the letters of the drives that 
	you want to ignore.  For example:

			set ednoscan=df

	will cause EDC to ignore drives D and F.  


	  If a full path name or one of the standard  DOS directory symbols 
	("\",  "." or "..") is given, EDC will change directories immediately
	without checking PATH.EDC.






	  If the -t option is used, EDC will display the directory tree 
	on your screen while it	is scanning.  The screen will pause after 
	displaying each page of information and give you an opportunity
	to choose a directory.  PATH.EDC will not be updated unless the 
	-k option is used.  For redirection to non-IBM printers, the -n 
	option will display the directory tree without using graphics 
	characters.  The -l option will display a list of directories 
	instead of a tree.  

	  The -l, -n, and -t options are different from the -s option
	in one respect.  If no drive is specified only the current 
	drive will be scanned.  If the -s option is combined with any
	of these options all hard drives will be scanned.


	  If none of your directory names have extensions you can use
	the -q option with any of the above options for quicker scans.
	For example:

			edc -sq    or    edc -tq


 	The -m and -r options can be used to create and remove directories.
	Rules for path names are the same as for DOS and PATH.EDC will be 
	updated after each change.  A -rn option has been added to rename 
	directories.  Old and new directories should be be in the same parent 
	directory.  If other commands are used to create and remove 
	directories you will have to rescan the affected drive.


	NOTE: EDC uses the MSDOS LASTDRIVE parameter to determine the 
	number of available drives on your system.  For best performance 
	insert the following line in CONFIG.SYS:

			LASTDRIVE = x

        where x is the letter of your last logical drive.







~ffind


    NAME:

	FFIND   Find all copies of file in specified path.


    SYNTAX:

	ffind [-abdfiklmnr?] [+-=date] [path] filename

						Finds all files in path with
					        the same name.

	ffind -e "command {}" [+-=date] [path] filename   

						Executes DOS command when each
						file is located.

    OPTIONS:

	a               Include hidden and system files in search.
        b               Batch mode, disable warning prompt.
        d               Include directories in search.
	e		Execute DOS command.

        l               Display in long format, showing
                        attributes, size, time and date.
        m               Display totals for each directory.
	n		Display output in lower case.
        r               Remove files when found.
        ?               Display help screen.



    DESCRIPTION:

	  FFIND will search the specified path for all copies of a given 
	file.  "path" should be a valid directory name or drive spec. If 
	"path" is omitted the search will begin from the root directory of 
	the current drive.  If "*:" is used for a path FFIND will search all 
	available hard drives. Wild cards can be used in file names and all 
	subdirectories will be searched. For example:

                ffind *.bak
        or
                ffind \ *.bak

        will search the entire current drive for all files named with
        an extension of .BAK.

                ffind d: temp





        will search all of drive D for all files named TEMP,

                ffind *: temp

        will search all hard drives for all files named TEMP, and

		ffind \games poker.exe

        will search the directory \GAMES and all subdirectories for all files 
	named POKER.EXE.


	  The -r option will delete files when found.  For example:

		ffind -r c:\ *.bak

	will search drive c for all files with an extension of .BAK and 
	remove them.  The -i option is similar to the -r option except that 
	the user is prompted before each file is removed.  The -r option 
	provides an initial warning prompt before execution.  If you ever 
	type "-r" when you really  meant to type "-l" you will appreciate 
	the need for this.  The -b option will override this feature for 
	unattended batch file operation.  This option is intended for use in
	batch files only.  Don't use it from the keyboard, or some day you 
	will type in "ffind -rb" when you least intend to.  

	  FFIND will locate hidden and system files with the -a option  but 
	the -r option cannot be used to remove protected files.  Use the -i 
	option to remove these files.

          The -l option can be used to display complete information on each 
	file located and the -k option will disable highlights and screen
	pauses, allowing the output to be redirected.

	  The -m option will display the total number of matching files in 
	each directory along with the total number of bytes used.  For 
	example:

		ffind -almk c:\ *.* > disk.map

	will create a complete usage map of the user's hard disk and store 
	it in DISK.MAP.

	  When "*:" is used as a drive spec, FFIND will ignore floppy drives 
	unless the -f option is used.  This eliminates the annoying wait
	on empty floppy drives.  Floppy drives can still be searched
	directly without using the -f option.

	  A semicolon can now be used to terminate a drive spec in place
	of a colon.  In addition FFIND will consider ";;" equivalent to
	"*:" and search all drives.  These modifications save a few
	key strokes.




	NOTE: FFIND uses the MSDOS LASTDRIVE parameter to determine the 
	number of available drives. If FFIND attempts to search non-existent 
	drives insert the following line in CONFIG.SYS:

			LASTDRIVE = x

        where x is the letter of your last logical drive.


	   FFIND can also locate files based on date.  The date parameter
	should be entered after any switches and before the path and file 
	arguments.  The date should be preceded by a "+", "-" or "=".
	For example:

			ffind -07/04/91 *.*

	will locate all files created or modified since July 4th, 1991.
	
			ffind -l +07/04/1991 *.txt

	will locate all  .TXT files older than July 4th, 1991 and display
	them in long format.

			ffind -r =07/04/1991 d; *.* 

	will locate and remove all files on drive D which are dated
	July 4th, 1991. 

	    FFIND can locate files by number of days back as well as 
	actual date.  For example:

			ffind =5 *.*

	will locate all files created exactly five days ago and 

			ffind -5 *.* 

	will locate all files newer than five days.



	  FFIND has a -e option which will cause the program to shell 
	to DOS and execute a command whenever a file is located.  The name 
	of the located file can be parsed into the command argument by 
	inserting a pair of braces wherever you want the file to be used.  
	For example:

			ffind -e "pkunzip {}" *.zip

	would unzip all the ZIP files on the current drive.  If a null
	argument is used,  FFIND will shell to DOS in the directory in
	which the file is located, giving you an opportunity to do
	whatever you want.  For example:

		        ffind -e "" test.txt



~get


    NAME:

	GET     Find all file names containing specified string.


    SYNTAX:

	get [-adfkl?] [path] string     Finds all files in path having
                                        string as part of file name.


    OPTIONS:

	a               Include hidden and system files in search.
        d               Include directories in search.
	f		Include floppy drives in search.
	k		No highlights or screen pauses.
        l               Display in long format, showing attributes, size, 
			time and date.
        ?               Display help screen.



    DESCRIPTION:

	  GET will search the specified path for all files having the 
	specified string as part of the file name.  If an extension is 
	provided GET will locate only files with that extension, otherwise 
	GET will locate all files regardless of extension.  For example:

                        get modem

        will locate QMODEM.DOC, JMODEM.ZIP and MODEMS.TXT.

                        get ted.zip

        will locate TED.ZIP and TED12.ZIP but will ignore TED.COM.

	  GET will locate hidden and system files with the -a option and
	the -l option can be used to display complete information on each 
	file located.  The -d option can be used to locate directories.  
	There are no options to remove files.  

	  The "path" specification is identical to the FFIND command.  If 
	you are searching all drives, the output of GET can be quite long.  
	Try piping it to VF.  For example:

                         get -k *: modems | vf



~head

					   file1 through filen.



    OPTIONS:    -###  Display the first ### lines.
                -v    Verbose. Print name of each file.
                -?    Display help screen.




    DESCRIPTION:


	  HEAD displays the first few lines of any text file.  The number
	of lines to display can be specified as an option.  For example

			head -50 dosnix.doc

	displays the first 50 lines of DOSNIX.DOC.  If the number of lines 
	is not specified the first ten lines are listed.  

	  HEAD can be used with wild cards and multiple arguments and a -v
	option is provided to give the name of each file as it is listed. 
	For example:

			head -20v *.c

	would list the first 20 lines of each C source file preceded by the
	file name.  When using the -v option the number of lines, if specified,
	should come before the 'v' as shown in the example.

	  HEAD will also read from STDIN and you can pipe the output of
	other commands to HEAD.  The -v option is not applicable when
	reading from standard input.

	x		Display files sorted across screen.
	z		Sort files by size.
        ?               Display help screen.



    DESCRIPTION:

	  LS displays the contents of a directory sorted across the screen 
	in five columns.  The arguments can be either files or directories. 
	If wildcards are used, all matching files will be listed.  Multiple
	arguments are accepted and more than one directory can be displayed.
	If no arguments are used, the contents of the current directory will
	be displayed.  If no options are used, -xpd will be assumed and file 
	totals will be displayed at the bottom of the listing.

          The -x option will display files sorted across the screen and
	is used in the default mode. The -c option will display files sorted 
	down each column rather than across each row.  If the  -1 (one) option 
	is used, one entry per line is displayed showing only the file name.






	  If the -l option is used, one entry per line is displayed, showing 
	name, attributes, size of file in bytes, and time and date of last 
	modification.  A modified DOS format is used which is more readable 
	than the standard UNIX format.  Attributes displayed in this format 
	are:

                        <DIR>           Subdirectory.
                        A               Archive bit is set.
                        R               File is read only.
                        H               File is hidden.
                        S               File is system.

	At the  end of each display the size of the directory in bytes is
	shown. The size of any subdirectories is not included in this figure.
	Also shown is the remaining disk space.

	  LS now has two new display formats.  The -2 option will display
	two entries per line showing file size and date and the -4 option
	will display four entries per line showing size only.  In these
	two modes the files are sorted down each column.  The -x option
	can be combined with either of these options to display files
	sorted horizontally.


          LS will pause after displaying one page of information. Typing "q" 
  	at this point will terminate the program. Typing any other key will  
	continue the display.  The -k option will suppress this feature and 
	provide a continuous output which can be  redirected.  In addition,
	the -k option will eliminate any graphics characters, allowing the
	output to be redirected to a non-IBM printer.


	  If the -a option is used, any hidden or system files contained in 
	the directory are also displayed.  The -f option will display file
	names only and omit any subdirectories.  The -p option will append a 
	back slash  to the end of each subdirectory name, allowing the user 
	to distinguish between files and  subdirectories.  This option will
	not work with the -l option.  


	  The -t option will will sort files by time and date and can be used 
	with the -r option to display newest files first.  The -e option 
	will sort file names by extension and the -u option will provide 
	unsorted output if so desired.


	  The -d option can be used to to display file totals at the end
	of each directory and the -n option will provide lower case output 
	if needed.





	  LS can  be custom configured by setting the environment
	variable "LSCFG" to the desired options.  For example:

			set lscfg=le

	will cause LS to default to the long format, with files sorted by 
	extension, unless an option is specified on the command line. 


	  LS is now EDC compatible.  If EDC is installed, LS will accept 
	partial directory names. LS will first look for an immediate directory
	with the specified name.  If no directory is found it will check 
	PATH.EDC for any matches.  If no matches are found it will then check
	for a file with the given name.  When using this feature the user is
	limited to one argument.  If more than one directory is specified on 
	the command line, PATH.EDC will not be searched.  This feature has 
	been made invisible so that LS can still be used as a stand-alone 
	directory lister.  As a result no error messages relating to EDC or 
	PATH.EDC will be displayed.


          This version of LS will not recursively list subdirectories but 
	the FFIND command can be used to obtain the same result.  For
	example:

		ffind -lm dirname *.*

		ffind -lm . *.*



~mv


    NAME:

	MV      Move file(s) to new file or directory.


    SYNTAX:

	mv [-afnost?] file1 file2       Moves (renames) file1 to file2.

	mv [-afnost?] file1 [file2..filen] dir1

					Moves any number of files to dir1.

	mv dir1 dir2                    Renames dir1 to dir2. dir1 and dir2 
					must be in the same parent directory.


    OPTIONS:

	a               Move read only, hidden and system files.
                        Prompt before overwriting protected files.
        f               Move and overwrite all files without prompting.
        i               Interactive mode. Prompt before moving.
        n               No delete. Do not overwrite existing files.
        o               Overwrite existing files without prompting.
        s               Move files without echoing to screen.
        t               Update file time and date when moving.
        ?               Display help screen.


    DESCRIPTION:

	  MV moves one or more files to a new file or directory. If more than 
	one source file is specified or wildcards are used, the last argument
	must  specify  an existing directory or an error will occur.  If a 
	directory is used as a source, all files in the directory will be
        moved but subdirectories will not be moved.

	  Each file is echoed to the screen as it is moved and existing files
	are not overwritten  without prompting.  If an existing file is 
	protected the user will be notified and prompted a second time before 
	the file is overwritten. Options are provided to override these 
	features when desired.

	  The -i option will prompt the user for a yes or no answer before 
	moving each file.  Used with wildcards or directory names this option 
	provides an interactive method of moving files.




	  In normal use MV, ignores hidden and system files and prompts
	the user before moving read only files. Hidden and system files can 
	be moved using the -a option or the -f option.  The -a option will 
	move read only, hidden and system files without prompting but will 
	still prompt the user before overwriting protected files. If the -f 
	option is used all existing files, even protected files, will be 
	overwritten without prompting the user.

	  The -o option can be used overwrite existing files without
	prompting but will not overwrite protected files.  If the -n option
        is used, no existing files will be overwritten and the user will not
        be prompted.  The -n option overrides all other options in this 
	respect.

	  If the -s option is used, filenames will not be echoed to the 
	screen when moving.  This option can be used with the -o, -f or -n 
	options when no screen output is desired.

	  In normal use MV will carry over the time and date of the old file.
	If the -t option is used, the new file will be stamped with the 
	current DOS time and date. Unlike the CP command, MV will also carry 
	over the attributes of the old file.




~mvdir


    NAME:

	MVDIR   Move directory and all subdirectories to new location.


    SYNTAX:

	mv dir1 dir2                    Moves dir1 to dir2



    OPTIONS:

	s               Move files without echoing to screen.
        ?               Display help screen.



    DESCRIPTION:

	  MVDIR will move a directory and all its subdirectories to the 
	specified target. If the target directory does not exist a new 
	directory will be created. If the target directory does exist a 
	directory will be created within the target directory having the 
	same name as the old directory.

	  MVDIR has three modes of operation totally independent of user 
	input.  If both old and new directories are in  the same parent 
	directory, MVDIR will rename the old directory.  If old and new 
	directories are not in the same parent directory but reside on the 
	same drive, MVDIR will create the new directory structure, rename 
	the files and then remove the old directory. If old and new directories
        reside on different drives MVDIR will create the new directory 
	structure, copy the files over and then remove the old files and 
	directories.  If an error occurs in this last mode, such as a disk 
	full error, MVDIR will abort and leave the old directory intact.



~rm


    NAME:

	RM      Remove file(s).


    SYNTAX:

	rm [-fis] file1...filen        Removes files.

	rm -r[fis] dir1..dirn          Completely removes directories.



    OPTIONS:

	f               Remove protected files without prompting.
        i               Remove files interactively.
        r               Recursively remove subdirectories.
        s               Remove files without echoing to screen.




    DESCRIPTION:

	  RM is the UNIX equivalent of the MSDOS DEL command.  If a protected 
	file is specified, RM will prompt you before removing it unless the
	-f option is used.  This version of RM will display each filename as
	it is removed.  You can use the  -s option to override this feature.

	  The -i option can be used wit	h wildcards to allow you to pick 
	and choose which files will be removed. For example:

                        rm -i *.*

	will display each filename in the current directory and prompt you
	for a yes or no answer before deleting.

	  The -r option is used to remove directories.  A directory cannot 
	be removed unless this option is used.  The directory along with all 
	files and subdirectories will be completely removed.  If you are using 
	RM to remove a directory on another drive, make sure that the drive is
	not logged in to the directory you are removing.  RM cannot remove the
        current directory of any drive.  

	  If the root directory of any drive is specified, all files and
	directories on the drive will be removed.  The root directory itself 
	can not be removed.  For example:

			rm -r a:\

	will remove everything on drive A.  RM is a great tool for erasing
	floppy disks but it is also capable of wiping out your hard disk.
	Use it with care.

	  RM will now accept multiple arguments, making it easier to clean
	up directories.  It is okay to mix file	names and directory names as 
	long as the -r option is used.




~rn


    NAME:

	RN      Rename file or directory.


    SYNTAX:


	rn oldfile newfile              Renames oldfile to newfile.
	rn oldfile dir                  Relocates oldfile to dir.
        rn olddir  newdir               Renames olddir to newdir.



    OPTIONS: none




    DESCRIPTION:

	  RN is similar to the MV command but is much more limited in scope.  
	Only one file or directory can be renamed at a time and wild cards 
	are not permitted.  Files can not be  relocated to another drive and 
	directories can only be renamed within the parent directory.  Because 
	of its small size, RN is very useful for floppy drive systems where
	space is limited.





~sgrep


    NAME:

	SGREP	Search text file(s) for specified string. 


    SYNTAX:


	sgrep [-chilnv] string file1...filen

					Searches file1..filen for string. 

        sgrep [-cinv] string		Searches STDIN for string.	




    OPTIONS:

	-c  		Print only a count of matching lines.
	-h  		Do not print file names.
	-i  		Ignore differences between upper and lower case.
        -l  		Print only the names of files with matching lines.
        -n  		Print line numbers of matching lines.
        -v  		Print only lines that don't match.


    DESCRIPTION:

	  SGREP is a simplified version of the UNIX FGREP command and
	is similar to the MSDOS FIND command.  SGREP will search one
	or more files for a specified text string and display each
	line in which the string is found. Unlike FIND, SGREP will
	accept wild cards and multiple arguments as filenames.  It
	is not necessary to enclose the search string in quotes unless
	it contains a space.  For example:

		sgrep Zmodem rta.log

	will find all references to Zmodem in RTA.LOG and

		sgrep "File Express" rta.log

	will find all references to File Express.

	  A -i option has been provided to ignore case differences
	when searching.  For example:

		sgrep -i zmodem rta.log

	will locate all references to ZMODEM, zmodem or Zmodem.



		
	  If more than one file is being searched, SGREP will precede
	each line displayed with the name of the file in which it is
	found.  The -h option will suppress this feature.  The -n option
	will display the number of each line.  For example:

		sgrep -n Zmodem *.log

	will display each line containing "Zmodem" preceded by the name
	of the file and the number of the line, while

		sgrep -h Zmodem *.log

	will display only lines containing "Zmodem" with no file name or
	line number.
		
  	  If the -n option is used SGREP will display only the names of
	files containing matching lines.  The -c option is similar but
	will also give a count of matching lines.  The -v option displays
	lines that do NOT match the search string.





~split


    NAME:

	SPLIT	Split a text file into several smaller files. 


    SYNTAX:


	split [-###]			Splits standard input into
					several small files.

	split [-###] file		Splits file into smaller files.



    OPTIONS:

	-###		Set output file size to ### lines.




    DESCRIPTION:

	  SPLIT will divide a text file into smaller files of 1000 lines each.  
	If a smaller or larger output file size is desired, the number of 
	lines can be specified as an option.  Output files are named by adding
	extensions of .XAA, .XAB, etc. to the source file name.  When reading 
	from standard input output files are named XAA, XAB, etc.  For example:

			split -500  dosnix.doc

	will divide DOSNIX.DOC into files of 500 lines each named DOSNIX.XAA, 
	DOSNIX.XAB, DOSNIX.XAC .... , while

			cat dosnix.doc | split -250

	will divide DOSNIX.DOC into files of 250 lines each named XAA, XAB, 
	XAC ....  This allows for up to 676 output files although it is not 
	wise to split up a file into that many pieces.  Files can be re-
	assembled after editing, or other modifications, by using CAT.




~tail


    NAME:

	TAIL          Display the last few lines of a file.


    SYNTAX:


	tail [+###][-###][cv] [file1 file2..filen]



    OPTIONS:    +###      Skip the first ### lines.
                -###      Display the last ### lines.
                -b        Count 512k blocks instead of lines.
                -c        Count characters instead of lines.
                -v        Verbose.  Display file names.
                -?        Display help screen.



    DESCRIPTION:


	  TAIL displays the last few lines of any text file.  The number
	of lines to display can be specified as an option.  For example

			tail -30 dosnix.doc

	displays the last 30 lines of DOSNIX.DOC.  If the number of lines 
	is not specified the last ten lines are listed.  


	  TAIL can be used with wild cards and multiple arguments and a -v
	option is provided to give the name of each file as it is listed. 
	For example:

			tail -20v *.c

	would list the last 20 lines of each C source file preceded by the
	file name.  When using the -v option the number of lines, if specified,
	should come before the 'v' as shown in the example.

	  Preceding the number of lines with a '+' instead of a '-' will
	will cause tail to skip the stated number of lines and list the
	remainder of the file.






	  The 'c' option will count characters instead of lines and the 'b'
	option will count 512k blocks.  For example:

			tail -1000c dosnix.doc 

	will display the last 1000 characters of DOSNIX.DOC and

			tail -5b dosnix.doc

	will display the last five blocks or 2560 characters.  With large text
	files these two options will be much faster than counting lines.


	  TAIL will also read from STDIN and you can pipe the output of
	other commands to TAIL.  The -v option is not applicable when
	reading from standard input.




~tee


    NAME:

	TEE     Copy standard input to standard output and file(s).


    SYNTAX:

	tee [-a] file1 [file2]..[file5]         Copies STDIN to STDOUT and 
						file1..file5.


    OPTIONS:

	a                       Append output to specified file[s]
        s                       Suppress standard output.


    DESCRIPTION:

	  TEE can be used with the DOS "|" operator and any command which 
	writes to standard output.  For example:

		cat file1 file2 | tee file3

	concatenates file1 and file2 while displaying them on the screen and 
	stores them in file3.

                 ls -lb dir1 | tee file1

        displays dir1 in long format and stores the output in file1.

          The -a option can be used to append the output to existing files.  
	If the -a option is not used, existing files will be overwritten.  
	For example:

                        tee -a file2 <file1

        displays file1 and appends it to the end of file2

                        tee file2 <file1

        displays file1 and overwrites file2.

          The -s option can be used to suppress standard output and write to 
	specified files only.  For example:

		cat source1 | tee -s file1 file2 file3

        will make multiple copies of source1 without displaying it on the 
	screen.

          TEE is meant for use with text files only and use with binary files 
	is not recommended.



~tolower


    NAME:

	TOLOWER         Convert to lower case.



    SYNTAX:

	tolower                         Converts STDIN to lower case and 
					writes to STDOUT.



    DESCRIPTION:

	  TOLOWER is a filter which will convert all upper case characters to 
	lower case.  All other characters are left unchanged.  For example:

                        tolower < file1 > file2

        converts file1 to lower case and stores the result in file2.





~touch


    NAME:

	TOUCH   Modify file date and time.



    SYNTAX:

	touch [-t] [mm/dd/yy;hh:mm:ss] file1
                                                Changes date and time of file1



    OPTIONS:

	t                       User selected time and date.



    DESCRIPTION:

	  TOUCH will change the date and time of the specified file to the 
	current DOS date and time.  If the -t option is used the user can 
	supply the date and time as the next argument in the format 
	mm/dd/yy;hh:mm:ss.  If the date and time argument is omitted the 
	user is prompted to enter the  date and time of his choice.  Wildcards 
	can be used in file names.




~toupper


    NAME:

	TOUPPER         Convert to upper case.



    SYNTAX:

	toupper                         Converts STDIN to upper case and 
					writes to STDOUT.



    DESCRIPTION:

	  TOUPPER is a filter which will convert all lower case characters 
	to upper case.  All other characters are left unchanged.  For example:

                        toupper < file1 > file2

        converts file1 to upper case and stores the result in file2.


~vf



    NAME:

	VF    View File 


    SYNTAX:


	vf      			   Read from standard input.	

        vf [-##b][+##][+\string] file	   Displays contents of file one 
					   page at a time.

	vf dir				   Lists directory and allows you
					   to choose file.


    SWITCHES:

        +###            Begin displaying at line ###.

	+\string	Begin displaying at first occurrence of string.

	-##             Set display adaptor to mode ##.

	-b		Write to BIOS instead of video memory.




    DESCRIPTION:

	  VF is a text file viewer which can read files containing
        up to 150,000 lines.  VF will recognize most relevant VI editor 
	commands and also makes full use of the cursor and function keys.
	To use VF merely type VF and the name of the file that you would 
	like to read.  For example:

			vf dosnix.doc

	Wild cards and multiple arguments can be used to view several files 
	in sequence.  For example:

			vf *.doc

	can be used to page through all .DOC files, and

			vf whats.new quickref.doc

	will first read WHATS.NEW, then QUICKREF.DOC.

	  

	   When VF begins, it will display one page of text and then pause. 
	 You can then enter one of the following commands:


	COMMAND			FUNCTION		VI/EX EQUIVALENT

	Home 		Move to beginning of file.		1G, :1

        End         	Move to end of file.			G, :$

 	<PgDn>      	Display next page.   			^F

        <PgUp>      	Display previous page.			^B

^L



        Down Arrow  	Display next line of text.		j

	Up Arrow    	Move back one line.			k

	Right Arrow	Shift screen one tab stop right.

	Left Arrow	Shift screen one tab stop left.

	] 		Display next half page of text.		^D

        [   		Move back one half page.		^U

        ^L              Rewrite current page.			^L

	:n		Read next file.   			:n

	:p		Read previous file.


	  The escape key can be used to interrupt text searches and exit
	the help screen.  It will also terminate the program from the main
	menu.  F10 or Del can be used in place of Esc and  ^PgUp and ^PgDn
	can be used in place of Home and End.






	  The number of the top line is displayed on the menu bar unless 
	the end of file message is visible. Then the line number displayed 
	will be the last line of the file.  Unless the file is very small, 
	you can use Esc to realign the last page and get rid of the message. 

	  If the number keys are used to go to a line already on the screen, 
	the screen will scroll until the line is at the top.  Otherwise the 
	screen will clear and a new page will be displayed.  

	  The number of every line can be displayed by pressing F6.  Line
	numbers will be displayed on the right hand side of the screen and
	will overwrite the last few columns of text.  Pressing the Right
	arrow key will shift the screen and allow you to read any text that
	is covered.

	  You can choose a new file from the directory by pressing F4.  The 
	current directory will be displayed and you can use the arrow keys 
	to choose either a new file or a new directory.  You can start the 
	program in this mode by using a directory as an argument.  Pressing 
	F5 while in this mode will allow you to change the file mask.

	  You can also choose a new file by pressing F5 from the main
	program.  You will then be given an opportunity to enter a new
	file name.

	  Text searches can be done by typing a "\" (F2) or a "/" (F8).  
	You will then be prompted to enter a search string.  VF will begin 
	displaying ten lines before the line containing the search string and 
	the matching line will be highlighted.  The "\" command will ignore 
	differences between upper and lower case.  The "/" command will find 
	only strings having the exact case as the search string.  Using the 
	shift key with with either of these commands (ie. "|" or "?") will 
	search backwards through the file for any previous occurence of a 
	string.  Typing a "n"  or F3 will continue searching in the same 
	direction  while "N" or F9 will search in the opposite direction.

	  VF also has several options which can be used from the command
	line.  If the +\string switch is used, VF will search the first 
	occurrence of "string" before displaying.  For example:

			vf +\ffind dosnix.doc

	will scan DOSNIX.DOC for the first occurrence of "ffind" and
	begin displaying ten lines before the first matching line.

	  Case sensitive searches can also be initiated from the command
	line.  





	  When +### is used as a switch, VF will begin displaying at 
	whatever line number is given after the plus sign.  For example:

		vf +300 dosnix.doc

	will begin displaying at line 300.


	  Normally VF writes text directly to video memory.  If the -b
	option is used VF will use the video BIOS to write text.  If
	you have a CGA monitor and are having trouble with "snow" the
	-b option will eliminate it.

	  An option has been provided to change the mode of your display
	adaptor.  To use this option type

				vf -# filename

	where # is the number of the new mode in decimal.  # can be any 
	valid text mode and you should check the manual for your graphics 
	card to see what modes are supported. Common text modes are listed
	below:


                               Standard  Text  Modes

		Mode       Card			Format

		0	  CGA		40 X 25     Black & White
		1	  CGA		40 X 25     Color
		2	  CGA		80 X 25     Black & White
		3         CGA		80 X 25     Color
		7	  Monochrome    80 X 25     Black & White

	EGA and VGA cards support all of the above modes but VGA does not
	distinguish beetween CGA Color and Black & White modes.

			        CONFIGURING VF

	  Under ordinary circumstances, VF is self-configuring and will
        adapt itself to existing screen colors and screen size.  To provide 
	an additional degree of flexibility screen colors can be set from 
	the environment.  This is done by setting the environment variable
	VFCOLORS to the desired colors.  eg:

			SET VFCOLORS=6E6F7F


	char 1-2	Normal screen colors for VF.  These are hex numbers 
			and correspond to standard DOS color attributes.  
			The first digit ranges from 0 to 7 and sets the 
			background color.  The second digit ranges from 0 to 
			F and sets the foreground color.

	char 3-4	Highlighted text search colors for VF. Same as above.

	char 5-6	Menu bar colors for VF.



			   DOS SCREEN COLOR CODES


                 NORMAL				BRIGHT / BLINK

	0	BLACK				8	BLACK

	1	BLUE				9	BLUE

	2	GREEN				A	GREEN

	3	CYAN				B	CYAN

	4	RED				C	RED

	5	MAGENTA				D	MAGENTA

	6	AMBER				E	YELLOW

	7	WHITE				F	WHITE


	If a number between 8 and F is used for a foreground color you
	will get bright text.  If it is used for background you will
	get blinking text.







~wc


    NAME:

	WC		Count lines, words and characters in a file. 



    SYNTAX:


	wc					Counts lines, words and
						characters in STDIN.

	wc [-clw] file1[..filen]		Counts lines words and
						characters in file1..filen.



    OPTIONS:

	-c  			Print character count only.
	-l  			Print line count only.
	-w  			Print word count only.



    DESCRIPTION:

	  WC will count the number of lines, words and characters in one
	or more text files and display the totals on the screen.  Options are 
	provided to print a count of lines only, words only or characters
	only. If no options are used WC will display all three counts.
	For example:

			wc dosnix.doc

	will display the total number of lines, words and characters in
	DOSNIX.DOC, while

			wc -l dosnix.doc

	will display only the number of lines in DOSNIX.DOC, and

			wc -w *.doc

	will display the number of words in each file with an extension of
	.DOC.  A word is considered to be one or more characters delimited
	by a blank, tab or a newline.





	  WC will also read from STDIN.  For example:

			cat *.c | wc 

	will give the total number of lines, words and characters in all
	.C files.  If WC is reading from a file, the name of each file
	will be printed after the count.  When reading from STDIN, no file
	name is printed.
