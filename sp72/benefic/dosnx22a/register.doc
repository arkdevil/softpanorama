	    Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software
	before buying it. If you try a Shareware program and continue
	using it, you are expected to register. Individual programs
	differ on details -- some request registration while others
	require it, some specify a maximum trial period. With
	registration, you get anything from the simple right to continue
	using the software to an updated program with printed manual.

	    Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software,
	and the copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific
	exceptions as stated below. Shareware authors are accomplished
	programmers, just like commercial authors, and the programs are
	of comparable quality. (In both cases, there are good programs
	and bad ones!) The main difference is in the method of
	distribution. The author specifically grants the right to copy
	and distribute the software, either to all and sundry or to a
	specific group. For example, some authors require written
	permission before a commercial disk vendor may copy their
	shareware.

	    Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software. 
	You should find software that suits your needs and pocketbook,
	whether it's commercial or Shareware. The Shareware system makes
	fitting your needs easier, because you can try before you buy.
	And because the overhead is low, prices are low also. Shareware
	has the ultimate money-back guarantee -- if you don't use the
	product, you don't pay for it.

			DISCLAIMER - AGREEMENT

	    Users of DOSNIX must accept this disclaimer of warranty:
	"DOSNIX is supplied as is.  The author disclaims all warranties,
	expressed or implied, including, without limitation, the
	warranties of merchantability and of fitness for any purpose.
	The author assumes no liability for damages, direct or conse-
	quential, which may result from the use of DOSNIX."

            DOSNIX is a "shareware program" and is provided at no charge
	to the user for evaluation.  Feel free to share it with your
	friends, but please do not give it away altered or as part of
	another system.  The essence of "user-supported" software is to
	provide personal computer users with quality software without
	high prices, and yet to provide incentive for programmers to
	continue to develop new products.  If you find this program
	useful and find that you are using DOSNIX and continue to use
	DOSNIX after a reasonable trial period, you must make a reg-
	istration payment of $35.00 to the author.  The $35.00
	registration fee will license one copy for use on any one
	computer at any one time.  You must treat this software just 
	like a book.  An example is that this software may be used by 
	any number of people and may be freely moved from one computer



	location to another, so long as there is no possibility of it
	being used at one location while it's being used at another.
	Just as a book cannot be read by two different persons at the
	same time.

	    Commercial users of DOSNIX must register and pay for their
	copies of DOSNIX within 60 days of first use or their license
	is withdrawn.  Site-License arrangements may be made by con-
	tacting the author.

	    Anyone distributing DOSNIX for any kind of remuneration must
	first contact the author at the address below for authorization.
	This authorization will be automatically granted to distributors
	recognized by the ASP as adhering to its guidelines for
	shareware distributors, and such distributors may begin offering
	DOSNIX immediately (However the author must still be advised 
	so that the distributor can be kept up-to-date with the latest
	version of DOSNIX.).

	    You are encouraged to pass a copy of DOSNIX along to your
	friends for evaluation.  Please encourage them to register their
	copy if they find that they can use it.  Registrations give authors
	the incentive and financial aid to continue developing their
	software.  Many good shareware programs have been abandoned for
	lack of support.  
	
	    This version of DOSNIX is a completely usable set of utilities 
	and has not been crippled.  When you register you will recieve a
	copy of the latest version of DOSNIX without nags.  Your reg-
	istration gives you the right to use future versions of DOSNIX 
	and you may upgrade at any time by sending $7.00 for shipping and 
	handling.  (Users who registered older versions may still have
	upgrades for the old price.)  You will also receive several bonus 
	utilities including an enhanced version of EDC.


	   To register your copy of DOSNIX or to purchase a site license,
	fill out the form and mail it me at the address below.	Or just 
	send me your name, address, and a check and tell me what you are 
	registering.  Don't forget disk size.
