WHAT IS OS/2 SPEED?
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

        A lot of shareware programs know about DESQview and can give time
        to other tasks when they don't need it (when a program is waiting
        for a keypress, or BBS software is waiting for a call, for
        example).  This means that when running these "DESQview aware"
        programs actually speed up other programs on your system because
        they are only using as much processor time as they need.

        Of course, OS/2 programs do this too - and programmers can make
        DOS programs running under OS/2 give away time like this - but
        many programs don't currently have this facility.

        This is where OS/2 SPEED comes in.  It tells programs that they
        are running under DESQview - and when they use the DESQview
        function to give away time, it intercepts this and calls the
        equivelant OS/2 function.  The net result is that all DESQview
        aware programs become OS/2 aware!



HOW DO I USE OS/2 SPEED?
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

        First, put a command to run OS/2 SPEED (OS2SPEED.COM) in your
        AUTOEXEC file so that it is loaded for each dos-box you open.

        If you put anything else on the command line then OS/2 SPEED will
        indicate when the program is releasing time slices by placing an
        asterisk in the top left hand corner of the dos window.  This is
        called monitor mode - try it and see!

        Examples:

                OS2SPEED                Runs OS/2 SPEED
                OS2SPEED *              Runs OS/2 SPEED in monitor mode.


        Next, change the settings for your DOS window so that the
        IDLE_SECONDS is set to 0 (this means that OS/2 SPEED can give
        away time).


DOES IT WORK?
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

        OS/2 comes with a utility called PULSE that gives you a graph of
        CPU usage.  Run it and see if OS/2 SPEED is making a difference
        in your case.   It makes a substantial difference in mine!


DISCLAIMER
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

        OS/2 speed works for me.  If it doesn't for you, please mail me
        telling me what happens and what you're trying to do - I'll see
        what I can do.   I may come up with a solution, but this package
        comes with no guarentees.  If it breaks - you keep both pieces.


CREDITS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

        I must say, I never would have thought of this idea on my own, but
        I saw a program, 'DV2WIN.EXE' by Ian Harris which performs a
        similar function, but for Microsoft Windows.  This gave me the
        idea for OS/2 SPEED.


UPDATES
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1.00    Initial Release

1.00b   OS/2 SPEED 1.00 always went into monitor mode regardless of what
        parameters were passed to it.  This is fixed in this release.
