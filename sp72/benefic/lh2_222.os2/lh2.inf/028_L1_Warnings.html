<BR>
 - Do not use very long file names (&gt;64 bytes) for archives that will

<BR>
  be distributed publicly (on an Electronic BBS,  for example).
<BR>

<BR>
  These long file names do not work well with the old FAT file system,
<BR>
  and do not work AT ALL with DOS.  In fact,  the DOS LHA program that
<BR>
  is required to extract the archive,  may "crash" on the long file
<BR>
  names.
<BR>

<BR>
  If the archive is for your own use,  or, if a public archive,  it's
<BR>
  use is clearly only for OS/2 users using the HPFS file system, than
<BR>
  you can disregard this warning.
<BR>

<BR>
 - If you store a dir with an EA,  dos and old LH/2 will not be able to

<BR>
  extract the archive correctly (the dirs will be extracted as a file,
<BR>
  preventing that dir from being created).
