<!-- entering slot 18 -->This option will extract/store file attributes:
<BR>

<BR>
When the List command is used,  LH/2 uses the following characters
<BR>
to distinguish file attributes:
<BR>

<BR>
'H' for hidden.
<BR>
'R' for write-only.
<BR>
'S' for system.
<BR>
'A' for archive.
<BR>

<BR>
These dos-style file attibutes should not be confused with OS/2 Extended

<BR>
Attributes (EAs).  EAs are used to store information such as icons,
<BR>
bitmaps, file descriptions, etc.
<BR>

<BR>
For more information about file attributes see the OS/2 on-line
<BR>
reference for the 'ATTRIB.EXE' program.
