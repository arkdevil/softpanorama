 - Think of LH as "XCOPY" with a transitional state: the *.lzh file.
<BR>
  Many of the options are the same as xcopy.
<BR>

<BR>
  The same options must be used during both collection and extraction to

<BR>
  end up with the same layout that you started with.  To get EXACTLY
<BR>
  what is on your disk (including file hidden/system/archive
<BR>
  attributes), you would do this:
<BR>

<BR>
  copy in: 
<PRE>lh a myarchive /s /e /a
</PRE>
       ( thiswillworktoo :lhamyarchive/ sea )
<BR>

<BR>
 copy out:
<PRE>lh x myarchive /s /e /a
</PRE>
  Bothoftheabovecommandsstartfromthecurrentdirectory . Ifthe
<BR>
 current directory is the root,  your whole disk would be stored.
<BR>

<BR>
 This is NOT recommended:
<BR>

<BR>
  
<PRE>lh a mydrives c:\* d:\* e:\* /se
</PRE>
 Since the drive letters are always removed when stored in an archive,
<BR>
 after extraction all of your files would end up on one disk.
