Although A:WARE Inc. still owns the source code, the executable is

use,  software installation or distribution, backup, etc.

<BR>
A:WARE Inc. may soon,  however,  sell a "compression kit" for
<BR>
those companies that insist on having source code,  or that want to
<BR>
build compression into their own OS/2 software installation/distribution
<BR>
programs.
