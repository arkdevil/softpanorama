If you delete a file, the contents of the file is not gone, only the name
of the file is removed from the directory. Therefore it is possible to
undelete the deleted file. Most of the time it is fine that a deleted file
can be restored, but sometimes it is highly undesirable. This is the case
when you delete a virus.

TbDel is a program that overwrites the file before deleting it. This makes
it sure that the deleted file can never be undeleted again.

The syntax of TbDel is the same as the normal DOS "DEL" command. TbDel
however does not allow wildcards in the filename specification. It can
only delete one file at a time.
