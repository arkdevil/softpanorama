1.  INTRODUCTION


  1.1.  Purpose of TbGarble

    TbGarble is an automatic disk encryptor and decryptor. It can
    encrypt and decrypt diskettes while writing and reading on the
    fly. No user action is required to convert the data.

    Although most devices attached to a PC are specific and not
    compatible with other devices of other machines, there is one sort
    of device that is very exchangable: the diskettes and their drives.
    Of course, due to their purpose it is quite normal that you can
    share and exchange your disks with other people, but in some
    environments this is undesirable.

    Some companies like to exchange their data between their machines,
    but not to the outside world. Other companies like to enable their
    employees to take their work to home, but not to take games from
    home to the company!

    These requirements seem to be contradictory. How is it possible
    to transport data from machine A to B, but make it impossible to
    transport data from machine B to A? It's not important how, but
    TbGarble makes it possible, and without increasing chances of
    incompatibility or drive failures! TbGarble scrambles and
    descrambles data being transferred from and to diskette drives on
    the fly. TbGarble acts like a two-way automatic filter. It
    determines itself whether a diskette is garbled or not, and
    processes all transfers according to this diskette type.

    The diskette type is determined while formatting the diskettes. If
    the diskette is formatted while garbling was enabled, all future
    data being transferred to that diskette will be garbled. Systems
    without TbGarble are not able to read or write to those diskettes.
    If the diskette is formatted while garbling was disabled, all
    future data being transferred to the diskette will not be garbled.
    Of course, if TbGarble is configured to process only garbled
    diskettes at that time, the machine will not be able to transfer
    data to this diskette, nor to read it.

    Here are a few examples that will explain the purpose of TbGarble:

    Example 1.
        You own a company, and the company processes very delicate
        data.  You don't want employees to take the data to their
        homes.  One option is to disable all floppy drives, but that
        makes it impossible to update data on the machines and to
        install new software. A good solution would be to install
        TbGarble and configure it to read from both garbled and normal
        diskettes, but write only to garbled diskettes.

    Example 2.
        You own a company, and the company processes very delicate
        data. You don't want employees to take the data to their
        homes, nor should they be able to install new software (and
        possible viruses!) or things like that. A good solution would
        be to install TbGarble and configure it to process only garbled
        diskettes. The machines will not be able to write or read from
        normal diskettes, but it is still possible to exchange data
        between machines owned by the company.

    Example 3.
        You own a company, and employees should be able to take data to
        their homes, install new software and so on. However, there are
        also some machines that processes accounts, and of course, you
        don't want your employees to install software on those
        machines. It would be handy on the other hand if it was
        possible to exchange data between the "account machines" and the
        normal machines. A solution would be to install TbGarble on the
        "account machines" and configure them to process only garbled
        diskettes. To enable the other machines to exchange data with
        these machines you should also install TbGarble on the normal
        machines and configure them to process both normal and garbled
        diskettes.


  1.2.  A Quick start

    Although we highly recommend a complete reading of this manual, here
    are some directions for a quick run of TbGarble:

    To load TbGarble type "TbGarble" and press return.

    The invocation syntax is:
            TBGARBLE [<options>]...

    For fast online help type "TbGarble ?" or "TbGarble help".


  1.3.  Benefits

    TbGarble has several advantages over other disk encryptors:

    +   It does not require any user intervention. Disks are encrypted
        or decrypted on the fly while reading and writing data.

    +   TbGarble can be configured to maintain compatibility with
        'normal' disks. In this case TbGarble will determine
        automatically whether the diskette in the drive is encrypted or
        not, and decrypt data only when the disk is encrypted.

    +   Because disks are decrypted on the fly, TbGarble will not write
        to the disk when decrypting data. The write-protect tab doesn't

        need to be removed. There is no increased risk of data
        corruption.

    +   TbGarble performs very fast. In fact, it is so fast that you
        will not be able to detect its presence.

    +   TbGarble uses less than 600 bytes of memory, and it can be
        loaded into upper memory.

2.  USAGE OF THE PROGRAM


  2.1.  System requirements

    TbGarble runs perfectly on standard machines, in line with our
    philosophy that there should be a limit to limitations.

    +   TbGarble can be executed under DOS version 3.00 (and all later
        versions). However, Dos 5.0 or higher is recommended, since
        TbGarble has been optimized and designed primarily for use with
        these DOS versions.

    +   TbGarble requires about 4 Kb of free memory to be invoked.
        After termination it requires only 600 bytes of memory.


  2.2.  Program invocation

    It is recommended to invoke TbGarble automatically from within your
    Config.Sys or Autoexec.Bat file.

    There are three possible ways to invoke TbGarble:

    To invoke TbGarble from the DOS prompt or within the Autoexec.Bat
    file:
            <path>TbGarble

    To invoke TbGarble from the Config.Sys as a TSR (Dos 4+):
            Install=<path>TbGarble.Exe

    To invoke TbGarble from the Config.Sys as a device driver:
            Device=<path>TbGarble.Exe

    TbGarble should always work correctly after being started from
    within the Autoexec.Bat. The "Install=" Config.Sys command is
    NOT available in DOS 3.xx.

    In addition to the three invocation possibilities DOS 5+ users can
    "highload" TbGarble into an UMB (upper memory block) if it is
    available:
            LoadHigh <path>TbGarble.Exe
    Within the Config.Sys file TbGarble can also be loaded high:
            DeviceHigh=<path>TbGarble.Exe

   2.2.1.  Invocation in Config.Sys

    -> Invoking TbGarble as a device driver does not work in all OEM
       versions of DOS. If it doesn't work use the "Install=" command
       or load TbGarble from within the Autoexec.Bat.

  2.3.  Command line options

    It is possible to specify options on the command line.

    optionword  parameter  short  explanation
    ----------  ---------  ----- ----------------------------

        help                ? =display this helpscreen
        remove              r =remove TbMem from memory
        off   [=<driveID>]  d =read and write only normal
        on    [=<driveID>]  e =read and write only garbled
        auto  [=<driveID>]  a =read and write garbled and normal
        write [=<driveID>]  w =read garbled and normal, write only garbled
        query               q =display diskette types

    TbGarble will by default use option 'auto' for both diskette
    drives.

   2.3.1.  help (?)

    If you specify this option TbGarble will show you the brief help as
    shown above.

   2.3.2.  remove (r)

    This option can be used to remove the resident part of TbGarble
    from your system's memory.  All memory used by TbGarble will be
    released.  Unfortunately, the removal of a TSR (like TbGarble) is
    not always possible.  TbGarble checks whether it is safe to remove
    the resident part from memory. If it is not safe it just disables
    TbGarble. A TSR can not be removed if another TSR has been started
    after it.  If this happens with TbGarble it will completely disable
    itself.

   2.3.3.  off (d)

    This option can be used to disable TbGarble. If you disable
    TbGarble, the machine will behave as if TbGarble wasn't loaded: it
    is no longer possible to use encrypted disks.

    You can optionally specify the drive for which this option applies.

   2.3.4.  on (e)

    If you specify this option, TbGarble will encrypt data to be
    written to disk, and decrypt data read from disk. It will not check
    if the disk is actually encrypted, so normal disks can not be read
    in this case.

    You can optionally specify the drive for which this option applies.

   2.3.5.  auto (a)



                                     Page 6

 Thunderbyte auto disk (de)cryptor v5.00 (C) 1992 Thunderbyte B.V.


    If you specify this option, TbGarble will automatically detect
    whether a disk in the drive is encrypted or not, and enable itself
    if the disk is encrypted, and disable itself when the disk is not
    encrypted. If you use this mode, you can read and write data from
    normal and encrypted disks without any special user actions.

    You can optionally specify the drive for which this option applies.

   2.3.6.  write (w)

    This option is almost the same as option 'auto', except for one
    thing: you can not write data to 'normal' disks! 'Normal' disks can
    be read however. There are no restrictions on the use of encrypted
    disks.

    You can optionally specify the drive for which this option applies.

   2.3.7.  query (q)

    If you use option 'auto' or 'write' it is not possible to find out
    whether a disk is encrypted or not because TbGarble decrypts any
    encrypted disk when you try to read data. Option 'query' can be
    used to find out whether a disk is encrypted.


  2.4.  Examples:

        C:\utils\TbGarble
    or:
        Device=C:\utils\TbGarble.Exe
    TbGarble is installed with the 'auto' mode for both diskette
    drives.


        C:\utils\TbGarble on=B
    TbGarble uses the 'auto' mode for drive A, but forces drive B to be
    encrypted.


  2.5.  Creating garbled disks

    In the 'auto' and 'off' mode, TbGarble will make a disk normal when
    the disk is being formatted.

    To create an encrypted diskette, you must specify the 'on' or
    'write' option of TbGarble before formatting the disk.

    After the disk has been formatted, you can write (copy) data to it
    if TbGarble option 'on', 'write' or 'auto' is used.


  2.6.  The encryption key



                                     Page 7

 Thunderbyte auto disk (de)cryptor v5.00 (C) 1992 Thunderbyte B.V.


    All unregistered versions of TbGarble use the same encryption key.
    Registered versions of TbGarble will use a random defined key in
    the TBAV.KEY file.

    If you are a registered user, nobody can determine your encryption
    key if they do not have access to your TBAV.KEY file. Make sure to
    keep a backup of your TBAV.KEY file! If you lose your key, there
    is no way to read your encrypted disks anymore!!!


  2.7.  The hardware garbler

    The main disadvantage of TbGarble is that it can be removed from
    the Config.Sys, and then the protection is gone.

    TbGarble is also available as an add-on card for the PC with AT and
    MCA buses. The Garbler can no longer be disabled, and is
    immediately active. It is even possible to boot from encrypted
    disks!

    If you have the hardware card, you can still use TbGarble.Exe to
    configure the hardware garbler. Before the TbGarble invocation,
    dipswitches on the card determine the behavior of the Garbler.

    Of course the card can also be configured to deny user
    configuration.

    Consult the accompanying documentation of the card for more
    information.
