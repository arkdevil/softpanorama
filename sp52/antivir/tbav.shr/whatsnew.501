-   Added an installation batch file.


5.00
----

Initial release of the complete Anti-Virus package.

TbSetup:
    This is a new program. It generates the Anti-Vir.Dat files that are used
    for integrity checking by TbScan. They are also used to validate programs
    that trigger the heuristic alarm of TbScan. Once validated the programs
    will not cause alarms anymore unless they are changed. The Anti-Vir.Dat
    will also contain additional information to enhance TbScan.
    The information stored in the Anti-Vir.Dat files will also be used
    by TbClean to clean and reconstruct infected files. In the future
    these files will have additional purposes.

TbScan:
    -   Removed some false heuristic alarms.
    -   Increased compatibility of the cache slightly.
    -   Enhanced heuristic warning '?' to detect more buggy viruses.
    -   Enhanced warning 'k' (now 'K') to reduce false alarms.
    -   Added new option 'quick' (integrity check only).
    -   Added new option 'secure' (Ctrl-Break not allowed).
    -   Added integrity checking (Anti-Vir.Dat).
    -   Added heuristic-validation feature (Anti-Vir.Dat).
    -   Improved the sanity check. It should now even work with
        all 'stealth' viruses!
    -   Removed the 'suspected files' counter from the status window
        to remove the source of some confusion.
    ->  Improved the log file user configuration. Introduced option
        'loglevel'. Options 'logall' and 'loginfo' are removed.
    -   TbScan now puts a pagefeed (12h) at the end of the log file.
        This makes printing by laser printers more convenient.

TbKey:
    -   The name of the generated key will now be TBAV.KEY.
        (The TbScan.Key's will remain valid).
    -   TbKey no longer overwrites already existing keys.
    -   The generated key will have the read-only attribute set.

TbRescue:
    -   Solved a bug causing TbRescue 'compare' to tell the user
        sometimes that the CMOS has been changed, even if there was no
        CMOS at all.
    ->  Replaced the command line parser with the 'new' one that has
        been used for some time in TbScan. The leading dash ('-')
        is now no longer required. The optional filename should be
        prefixed by a '='. (i.e. 'store=test.dat').
    -   TbRescue no longer stores system memory sizes larger than
        640Kb in the anti-virus partition code, to avoid false alarms
        while booting (since there is never more than 640Kb of free
        memory). The amount of memory will by default be 640Kb.

TbClean:
    This is a new program. It can clean almost any infected file
    by using the Anti-Vir.Dat files. It can however also clean
    infected files without any information about either the virus
    or the original file. This is the first cleaner in the world
    that has this heuristic cleaning mode.

TbDriver:
    This is a new program. It greatly enhances the Thunderbyte resident
    utilities. The number of resident Thunderbyte utilities will be
    expanded. TbDriver takes care of the cooperation between these
    utilities, the input and output, the MS-Windows and Novell support.
    TbDriver also incorporates language support. Messages of TbScanX
    and other resident Thunderbyte utilities will appear in your
    language.

TbScanX:
    ->  TbScanX now requires TbDriver to be loaded. The virus alarm
        of TbScanX is now full screen.
    ->  Network support has been increased. Consult the manual of
        TbScanX and TbDriver.
    -   Solved a minor bug in the TbScanX API.
    -   Solved a bug in the Windows specific code.
    ->  Replaced the command line parser with the 'new' one that has
        been used for some time in TbScan. The leading dash ('-')
        is now no longer required.
    ->  TbScanX by default does not display the memory report
        and the VirScan.Dat comment anymore. Therfore option 'nologo'
        has been removed. Option 'verbose' can be used to get the 
        report and comment displayed again.
    -   Improved scanning at program load.
    -   The processor optimized versions of TbScanX will not be
        distributed in the TBAV package. They are however available
        for registered users on any Thunderbyte registration BBS.
        A valid TBAV.KEY (or TBSCAN.KEY) is required to get them
        working.
    -   TbScanX now searches for VirScan.Dat before TbScan.Dat.
        This avoids confusion by people who still have an obsolete
        TbScan.Dat.

TbCheck:
    This is a new program. It is a memory resident integrity
    checker, that uses the Anti-Vir.Dat file to check every
    program just before it is executed. As you might expect,
    this program is extremely fast and consumes only 600 bytes
    of memory. Consult the manual for more details.

TbMem:
    This is a new program. It monitors the system and detects
    viruses and prevents them from going resident in memory.

TbDisk:
    This is a new program. It monitors the system and detects
    viruses and prevents them from writing and formatting the disk.

TbFile:
    This is a new program. It monitors the system and detects
    viruses and prevents them from infecting other files.
    It also contains the readonly guard.

TbGarble:
    This is a new program. It is an automatic disk encryptor /
    decryptor.

TBAV:
    This is a new program. It is a full featured menu shell for
    the TBAV utilities. (Note the file size: about 8Kb. It contains
    however screen and menu routines, dialog boxes, mouse support,
    a textfile viewer, program shell, language support, etc.
    This is assembler programming: everything in 8Kb without
    compression!) MS-Windows users: a PIF file is supplied!
