2.  INTRODUCTION TO THUNDERBYTE ANTI VIRUS


  2.1.  An overview

    What is Thunderbyte Anti-Virus? Thunderbyte Anti-Virus (TBAV) is a
    toolkit designed to protect against, and recover from computer
    viruses.

    There are already many anti-virus packages, so you may wonder what
    is so special about these utilities. Here is a quick overview. Note
    that this overview is not complete, it just highlights a few of the
    many remarkable features.

   2.1.1.  Signature scanning

        The signatures used by this package are not just created by us
        as the vendor. Many independant researchers contribute to the
        signature list we use. The signature file is in ASCII and can
        be updated by yourself in case of emergency.

   2.1.2.  Algorithmic virus recognition.

        Algorithmic virus recognition through the use of AVR modules.
        TbScan can detect polymorphic viruses very easily by use of the
        easy to update external AVR modules.

   2.1.3.  Integrity checking.

        TbScan performs an integrity check automatically, and it does
        not have the false alarm rate other integrity checkers have.
        The goal is to detect viruses and not to detect configuration
        changes!

   2.1.4.  Heuristic analysis.

        TbScan is the world's first scanner that incorporates heuristic
        analysis in a normal scan session.  Heuristic analysis is a
        technique that makes it possible to detect about 90% of all
        viruses by searching for suspicious instruction sequences
        rather than using any signature. This is possible because
        TbScan contains a real disassembler and code analyzer.

   2.1.5.  High speed.

        In a normal scan session, TbScan is faster than any other
        scanner, even with signature scanning, integrity checking and
        heuristic analysis fully enabled!

   2.1.6.  A reconstructive cleaner.

        A reconstructive cleaner that removes viruses by using the



                                     Page 5

 Thunderbyte Anti Virus v5.00 (C) 1989-1992 Thunderbyte B.V.


        integrity check information for a guaranteed 100% restoration.

   2.1.7.  A heuristic cleaner.

        The worlds first heuristic cleaner! Heuristic cleaning is a
        technique that makes it possible to remove even unknown
        viruses, without any information about the virus and without
        any information about the original file! Literally, the cleaner
        removes the unknown from the unknown! The success rate of this
        unknown virus remover is 80%, which even beats conventional
        cleaners that require predefined virus information.

   2.1.8.  Resident signature scanner.

        A resident signature scanner that can swap itself into
        expanded, XMS, or high memory, using only 1Kb of conventional
        memory!

   2.1.9.  Resident integrity checker.

        A resident integrity checker for higher protection. It is fast
        and consumes only 600 bytes of memory.

   2.1.10.  Bootsector immunizer.

        The TbRescue program can install a new master boot record which
        has some unique virus detection capabilities, without becoming
        resident in memory!

   2.1.11.  MBR/CMOS maintenance.

        Master boot record, bootsector, and CMOS; save, restore and
        checking facilities.

   2.1.12.  Memory guard.

        A memory guard program that detects viruses and prevents them
        from going resident in memory.

   2.1.13.  Disk guard.

        A disk guard program that detects viruses and prevents them
        from overwriting and formatting the disk.

   2.1.14.  File guard.

        A file guard program that detects viruses and prevents them
        from infecting programs.

   2.1.15.  Network support.

        Most other resident anti-virus products offer you the choice to



                                     Page 6

 Thunderbyte Anti Virus v5.00 (C) 1989-1992 Thunderbyte B.V.


        invoke them before the network is loaded and losing the
        protection after the logon procedure, or to invoke the anti-
        virus software AFTER the logon to the network, resulting in a
        partially unprotected system. The Thunderbyte Anti-Virus
        utilities recognize the network software and take appropriate
        actions to ensure their functionality.


  2.2.  TbSetup

    TbSetup is a program that collects information from all software
    found on your system. The information will be put in files named
    Anti-Vir.Dat. The information maintained in these files can be used
    for integrity checking, program validation, and to clean infected
    files.


  2.3.  TbScan

    TbScan is one of the fastest (and at this moment the fastest)
    virus scanner available. Besides its blazing speed it has many
    configuration options, it can detect mutants of viruses, it can
    bypass stealth type viruses, etc.

    The most remarkable feature is the ability of TbScan to disassemble
    files. This makes it possible to detect suspicious instruction
    sequences and to detect yet unknown viruses. TbScan can detect 95%
    of the viruses without any information like signatures or checksum
    files! This generic detection is named heuristic analysis.

    Another feature of TbScan is the integrity checking it performs
    when it finds the Anti-Vir.Dat files generated by TbSetup.


  2.4.  TbDriver

    TbDriver is a memory resident utility. This driver is needed by the
    resident TBAV utilities. It takes care for the pop-up window, the
    language support, the network support, the MS-Windows support, etc.


  2.5.  TbScanX

    TbScanX is the memory resident version of TbScan. This signature
    scanner remains resident in memory and automatically scans those
    files which are being executed, copied, de-archived, downloaded,
    etc.

    TbScanX performs even faster than TbScan, and does not require much
    memory. It is even possible to reduce the memory requirements of
    TbScanX to zero (!) as TbScanX can make use of unused parts of your
    video memory.

 Thunderbyte Anti Virus v5.00 (C) 1989-1992 Thunderbyte B.V.



  2.6.  TbCheck

    TbCheck is a memory resident integrity checker. This program
    remains resident in memory and checks automatically every file just
    before it is being executed. TbCheck uses a very fast integrity
    checking method and it consumes only 400 bytes of memory. It can be
    configured to reject files with incorrect checksums, and/or to
    reject files that do not have a corresponding Anti-Vir.Dat record.


  2.7.  TbMem

    TbMem detects attempts from program to remain resident in memory,
    and makes sure that no program can remain resident in memory
    without permission. Since most viruses remain resident in memory,
    this is a powerfull weapon against all those viruses, known or
    unnown. Permission information is maintained in the Anti-Vir.Dat
    files.


  2.8.  TbDisk

    TbDisk detects attempts from programs to write directly to disk
    (without using DOS), attempts to format, etc., and makes sure that
    no malicious program will succeed in destroying your data.
    Permission information about the rare programs that write directly
    and/or format the disk is maintained in the Anti-Vir.Dat files.


  2.9.  TbFile

    TbFile detects attempts from programs to infect other programs. It
    also guards read-only attributes, detects illegal timestamps, etc.
    It will make sure that no virus succeeds in infecting programs.


  2.10.  TbClean

    TbClean is a generic file cleaning utility. It uses the
    Anti-Vir.Dat files generated by TbSetup to enhance file cleaning
    and/or to verify the results. TbClean can however also work without
    these files. It disassembles and emulates the infected file and
    uses this analysis to reconstruct the original file.


  2.11.  TbRescue

    Some viruses copy themselves onto the partition table of the hard
    disk.  Unlike bootsector viruses, they are hard to remove. The only
    solution would seem to be to low-level format the hard disk and to
    create a new partition table.



                                     Page 8

 Thunderbyte Anti Virus v5.00 (C) 1989-1992 Thunderbyte B.V.


    TbRescue offers a more convenient alternative to such radical
    measures.  It makes a back-up of your uninfected partition table
    and boot sector.  If these get infected in your system, the
    TbRescue back-up can be used as a verifying tool and as a means to
    restore the original (uninfected) partition table and bootsector
    without the need for a disk format. The program can also restore
    the CMOS configuration for you.

    If a back-up of your partition table is not available, TbRescue
    will try to create a new partition table anyway, again avoiding the
    need for a low-level format.

    Another important feature of TbRescue is that it can be used to
    replace the partition table code by new code that offers greater
    resistance to viruses. The TbRescue partition code will be executed
    before the boot sector gains control, enabling it to check this
    sector in a clean environment. The TbRescue partition code performs
    a CRC calculation on the boot sector just before control is
    passed to it. If the boot sector has been modified the TbRescue
    partition code will warn you about this. The TbRescue partition
    code also checks the RAM lay-out and informs you whether or not it
    has been changed. It carries out these checks each time you boot
    from your hard disk.

    Note that once the boot sector has been executed unchecked, it is
    very difficult to check it afterwards. A virus could have become
    resident in memory during boot-up and have hidden its presence.
    Once again, TbRescue will offer you a great deal of security here
    as it is active BEFORE the boot sector is executed.

    Also note that the use of TbRescue is much more convenient than the
    traditional strategy of booting from a clean DOS diskette for an
    undisturbed inspection of the boot sector.


  2.12.  Compatibility

    The Thunderbyte Anti-Virus utilities are designed to cooperate with
    networks, MS-Windows, DR-DOS, etc.


  2.13.  MS Windows

    The Thunderbyte Anti-Virus utilities are Microsoft Windows
    compatible. The utilities remain active in every DOS box, without
    mixing the operation of the adjacent windows. All TBAV utilities
    can also be invoked in a graphics DOS box inside Windows.

    What you will not find in the TBAV package are fancy looking
    Windows programs. There are several reasons for this omission:

    -   A Windows scanner never offers additional functionality.



                                     Page 9

 Thunderbyte Anti Virus v5.00 (C) 1989-1992 Thunderbyte B.V.


        Instead, a Windows scanner requires more system resources,
        becomes larger and slower, and performs less reliable. The only
        'gain' would be a prettier screen lay-out. If the screen layout
        is your major concern, TBAV is not the Anti-Virus package for
        you!

    -   If one of the Windows files gets infected, Windows will most
        likely refuse to work and hang the machine. Just in this case
        you need a scanner to see what is going on, but you can not use
        it anymore!

    -   To cope with stealth viruses it is required to boot from a
        clean DOS diskette before running the scanner. But, ever tried
        to boot Windows off a diskette?

    TBAV provides fine Windows support, but no nonsense.

3.  EXAMPLE SETUPS


  3.1.  Initial installation

    In the following examples it is assumed that all utilities are
    copied in a directory named TBAV. If this is not the case, execute
    the following commands:

        MD C:\TBAV
        COPY *.* C:\TBAV
        C:
        CD \TBAV

    For all example setups it is required that TbSetup has been
    executed:
        TbSetup C:\

    If your system has more hard disks or disk partitions you should
    repeat the TbSetup invocation for every drive or partition.

    It is also highly recommended to make a recovery diskette. The
    example setups assume you have created such a recovery diskette.

    It is also highly recommended to read the manuals of all the TBAV
    products. The example setups outlined below are just intended to
    give you some ideas about the use of the TBAV utilities, and these
    examples are not intended as a full featured protection setup!


  3.2.  Creation of a recovery diskette

    A recovery diskette is required to get rid of any virus in the
    future. Without such a diskette, you will never be able to get rid
    of any virus! So, take a few minutes to make this diskette now!

    Take a new, empty diskette, put it in drive A:, go to your DOS
    directory and execute the following commands:
        Format A:\ /S Copy
        Copy SYS.COM A:

    Now return to the TBAV directory:
        CD \TBAV

    Copy some of the Thunderbyte utilities to the diskette:
        Copy TbScan.Exe A:
        Copy VirScan.Dat A:
        Copy TbDriver.Exe A:
        Copy TbCheck.Exe A:
        Copy TbClean.Exe a:
        Copy TbRescue.Exe a:
        Copy Intro.Doc a:\help!.Doc



                                    Page 11

 Thunderbyte Anti Virus v5.00 (C) 1989-1992 Thunderbyte B.V.


    Make a backup of the bootsector, partition sector and CMOS
    configuration by using TbRescue:
        TbRescue store a:\TbRescue.Dat

    Make a Config.Sys file. Type the following lines:
        Copy Con A:Config.Sys
        Files=20
        Buffers=20
        Device=TbDriver.Exe
        Device=TbCheck.Exe FullCRC
    Press now Ctrl-Z, and DOS responds with something like '1 file(s)
    copied.'

    Now copy any other utilities you think you need in case of an
    emergency to the diskette. A tiny editor - to edit Config.Sys
    and/or AutoExec.Bat - is also highly recommended.

    If your hard disk needs some special device driver to be accessed
    (like a Stackered disk), copy the required device drivers also to
    the recovery diskette and install the drivers in the Config.Sys
    file on drive A:. Consult the manual of these device drivers for
    additional help.

    Now execute TbSetup as follows:
        TbSetup A:

    The diskette is now almost ready. MAKE THE DISK WRITE PROTECTED BY
    USING THE WRITE PROTECT TAB! Label the diskette with 'Recovery'.
    Now store the diskette into a safe place. Do not use it until you
    need it!


  3.3.  Prevention of illegal software

    A lot of companies do not want their users to install or execute
    unauthorized software. TBAV can help to prevent this.

    Add to the Config.Sys the following lines:
        Device=C:\TBAV\TbDriver.Exe
        Device=C:\TBAV\TbCheck.Exe secure

    Execute TbSetup on the system.
        TbSetup C:\

    Reboot the system.
        Press Ctrl-Alt-Del.

    If the user now tries to execute new software - software not
    authorized by TbSetup -, TbCheck does not allow these files to be
    executed.

 Thunderbyte Anti Virus v5.00 (C) 1989-1992 Thunderbyte B.V.


  3.4.  Prevention of viruses

    To prevent virusses from doing any harm on your system, execute or
    install the following products:

    Execute TbRescue to make a backup of the partition table and to
    replace the partition code by a partition sector with virus
    detection capabilities:
        TbRescue immnunize a:tbrescue.dat

    Add the following lines to the config.sys file:
        Device=C:\TBAV\TbDriver.Exe
        Device=C:\TBAV\TbScanX.Exe
        Device=C:\TBAV\TbMem.Exe
        Device=C:\TBAV\TbFile.Exe

    Add the following line to the autoexec.bat file:
        C:\TBAV\TbDisk

    Reboot the system.
        Press Ctrl-Alt-Del.

    It is very likely that some of the TBAV utilities display a message
    when you boot again. This because some programs that are invoked
    perform operations that are monitored by the TBAV utilities. TBAV
    has to 'learn' which programs perform these operations. If you
    respond with 'Y' everytime, TBAV will remember this for next time,
    and it will not bother you again with these messages and questions.

    Reboot the system again.
        Press Ctrl-Alt-Del.

    The TBAV utilities now monitor the system and warn you if something
    suspicious - or worse - is going on! They also warn you if a new
    file contains a virus. In all situations, viruses are detected
    before they can do any harm.


  3.5.  Detection of viruses

    To detect viruses AFTER an infection occured, you can also use the
    TBAV utilities.

    Add the following lines to the config.sys file:
        Device=C:\TBAV\TbDriver.Exe
        Device=C:\TBAV\TbCheck.Exe

    Add the following line to the autoexec.bat file:
        C:\TBAV\TbScan C:\ once

    Reboot the system.
        Press Ctrl-Alt-Del.



                                    Page 13

 Thunderbyte Anti Virus v5.00 (C) 1989-1992 Thunderbyte B.V.


    TbCheck will warn you if files have been changed. TbScan is invoked
    automatically once a day.


  3.6.  A full protected system

    The best protection is achieved with the following setup.

    Execute TbRescue to make a backup of the partition table and to
    replace the partition code by a partition sector with virus
    detection capabilities:
        TbRescue immnunize a:tbrescue.dat

    Add the following lines to the config.sys file:
        Device=C:\TBAV\TbDriver.Exe
        Device=C:\TBAV\TbCheck.Exe
        Device=C:\TBAV\TbScanX.Exe
        Device=C:\TBAV\TbMem.Exe
        Device=C:\TBAV\TbFile.Exe

    Add the following line to the autoexec.bat file:
        C:\TBAV\TbDisk
        C:\TBAV\TbScan C:\ once

    Reboot the system.
        Press Ctrl-Alt-Del.

    It is very likely that some of the TBAV utilities display a message
    when you boot again. This because some programs that are invoked
    perform operations that are monitored by the TBAV utilities. TBAV
    has to 'learn' which programs perform these operations. If you
    respond with 'Y' everytime, TBAV will remember this for next time,
    and it will not bother you again with these messages and questions.

    Reboot the system again.
        Press Ctrl-Alt-Del.

    The TBAV utilities now monitor the system and warn you if something
    suspicious - or worse - is going on! They also warn you if a new
    file contains a virus. In all situations, viruses are detected
    before they can do any harm. Viruses are also detected after they
    are installed on the system for any reason.


  3.7.  Protection against employees.

    Most of the TBAV utilities are interactive. They require
    communication with the user if something is going on. In companies
    however it may be that the system operator is the only one who
    should commnicate with TBAV in case something is going on. All TBAV
    utilities support the option 'secure'. If this option is specified,
    the TBAV utilities will not ask the user for permission before



                                    Page 14

 Thunderbyte Anti Virus v5.00 (C) 1989-1992 Thunderbyte B.V.


    allowing dangerous operations: TBAV will always deny all dangerous
    and suspicious operations.


  3.8.  System maintenance.

    Unfortunately, a system needs maintenance. This maintenance also
    affects the TBAV utilities. The signature file of TbScan needs a
    frequent update. You can obtain a new signature file on one of our
    support Bulletin Board Systems.

    It is likely that you add, update or replace programs on your
    system. If you do so, do not forget to use TbSetup to make or
    update the fingerprints of these programs!

    If you install a new version of DOS, the bootsector will be
    changed. If you change the configuration of your disks, the
    partition table and/or CMOS configuration will change. You need to
    create a new recovery diskette in these cases.


  3.9.  Recovering from viruses.

    DO NOT MAKE A NEW BACK-UP OF YOUR SYSTEM THAT WILL OVERWRITE AN
    ALREADY EXISTING BACK-UP. Make a separate back-up instead and label
    it as being infected and unreliable.

    When recovering from a virus infection it is important that you
    boot from the uninfected, write-protected, recovery diskette. (If
    you followed our recommendations, you have a diskette labeled
    'recovery').

    Do NOT run any program from your hard disk! The virus must be
    denied access to your memory while you clean up the system. TbCheck
    will warn you if you accidentially try to execute an infected or
    unauthorized program of your hard disk.

    Run TbScan for an indication about what is wrong. TbScan will
    report the virus name if the virus is known, or it will report file
    changes in case the virus is unknown.
        TbScan C:\ log=lpt1

    Also run TbRescue to compare the bootsector, partition code and
    CMOS configuration.
        TbRescue compare

    If the bootsector or partition code contains a virus, you can use
    TbRescue to remove the virus from these items:
        TbRescue restore

    In case of a file virus, restore all executables. TbClean is not
    recommended unless you don't have a back-up of the uninfected



                                    Page 15

 Thunderbyte Anti Virus v5.00 (C) 1989-1992 Thunderbyte B.V.


    executable files. Depending on the kind of virus it might also be
    necessary to replace all data files.

    Once the system has been cleaned, check all diskettes, back-ups,
    etc. One infected diskette can cause you the same trouble all over
    again. Therefore we highly recommend you to take measures to
    protect your system against re-infections, since there is always
    the possibility that you forgot to clean up one of your diskettes.
    Use a virus scanner frequently, install a resident scanner (like
    TbScanX), or even better, install the Thunderbyte PC Immunizer card.

4.  MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION


  4.1.  Who are we?

    The Thunderbyte Anti-Virus utilities have been developed by Frans
    Veldman, chief executive of the ESaSS and Thunderbyte company.
    ESaSS is the company that developed the well-known Thunderbyte
    card, the first hardware PC immunizer, and has gained a great
    deal of experience with and knowledge of viruses and
    assembler-written system software. Of course, we do have a large
    collection of viruses to test our products on.


  4.2.  Updates

    The Thunderbyte Anti-Virus utilities are updated often. The updates
    will be available on all Thunderbyte support BBSs but also a lot
    of other BBSs will have the most recent version of our software
    available.

    The standard complete release will be named: TBAVxxx.ZIP.
    The 'xxx' will be replaced by the three digit version number of the
    Thunderbyte Anti-Virus utilities.

    To maintain the high reliability of the products, beta releases
    are available.  They will not be distributed widely, but are just
    available on the Thunderbyte support BBS in The Netherlands and in
    the USA.  They will only contain the files that have been changed.
    Beta versions can be recognized because they have a 'B' in the
    name:  TBAVBxxx.ZIP.

    To minimize download costs there will also be upgrade archives
    which contain files that have been changed since the previous
    official release. They will have a 'U' in their name:  TBAVUxxx.ZIP.

    The resident Thunderbyte Anti-Virus utilities are also available in
    processor optimized formats. These processor optimized versions are
    available for registered users only, and they are archived in a
    file with a 'X' in the name: TBAVXxxx.ZIP.


  4.3.  Distribution of the signature file

    The signature file (VIRSCAN.DAT) is updated every month. It will be
    distributed in an archive called VSIGYY##.ZIP (YY = Year, ## =
    release sequence number). Emergency updates are released as files
    called ADDNSIGS.DAT which will be distributed as the archive
    ASIGYY##.ZIP file.YY = Year, ## = release sequence number). Most
    Bulletin Board Systems will get a fresh copy of these two files
    within 48 hours after the Master Copy has been updated at Bamestra
    BBS. The most recent signature files can also be obtained from any

    Thunderbyte support BBS.


  4.4.  Language support

    The Thunderbyte Anti-Virus utilities do support several languages.
    The language support files are distributed in archives named
    TB<name><version>.ZIP, whereas <name> stands for the two or three
    character country code, and version for the version number of TBAV.
    A language support file for The Netherlands whould have the name
    TBNL500.ZIP (version 5.00). You will find these language files on
    most Thunderbyte support BBSes.


  4.5.  Thanks

    The Thunderbyte Anti-Virus utilities would not have evolved to
    their current state without the valuable contributions made by a
    number of people.  Special thanks to:

5.  A VIRUS, NOW WHAT?


  5.1.  Prevention

    It is always better to be safe now than to be sorry afterwards. You
    can prevent an infection by using reliable software only, i.e.
    software of which the origins are known.

    MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AN UNINFECTED WRITE-PROTECTED BOOTABLE DOS DISK
    STORED IN A SAFE PLACE. The disk will be needed in case of
    infection. Without an uninfected bootable disk you will never be
    able to get rid of any virus! The disk should be write-protected to
    make sure it will remain uninfected!

    Make sure you use TbSetup to maintain recovery information of all
    executable files of your system!

    Only boot from your hard disk or from your original DOS diskette.
    NEVER use someone else's disk to boot from. Should you have a hard
    disk, make certain that you have opened the door to your floppy
    drive before resetting or booting your PC.

    Use the DOS program ChkDsk frequently (without the /F switch).
    ChkDsk is able to detect some viruses because the viruses change
    the disk structure in an incorrect manner, causing disk errors in
    the process.

    Look out for changes in the behaviour of your software or system.
    Any change in their behaviour is suspect, unless you know its
    cause.  Some highly suspicious symptoms are:

    -   The amount of available memory space has decreased.
    -   Programs need more time to execute.
    -   Programs do not operate as they used to, or cause the system
        to crash or reboot after some time.
    -   Data disappears or get damaged.
    -   The size of one or more programs has increased.
    -   The screen behaves strangely, or you will find unusual
        information displayed there.
    -   ChkDsk detects many errors.


  5.2.  Confirmation

    Once you think your system may have been infected by a virus, try
    to get confirmation. You can get confirmation by using a virus
    scanner, or by booting from the uninfected write-protected DOS
    diskette and comparing the files on the hard disk to the known
    uninfected original copies. DO NOT RUN ANY PROGRAM ON THE HARD DISK
    WHILE AND BEFORE PERFORMING THIS TEST TO PREVENT THE VIRUS FROM
    GOING RESIDENT IN MEMORY. If the files have not been changed you



                                    Page 19

 Thunderbyte Anti Virus v5.00 (C) 1989-1992 Thunderbyte B.V.


    are not dealing with a file virus.  However, if they all appear
    changed in the same manner, it is very likely that the files have
    been infected. The bootsector is more difficult to test. Use the
    DOS SYS command to replace the bootsector in case of doubt.

    Note that file viruses infect other programs. It is highly unlikely
    that you will find a few infected programs on a hard disk used
    frequently. If TbScan reports a virus in only 1% of the files on
    your hard disk, you should treat it as a false alarm.

    If you find a virus, do NOT use your copy of TbScan to check other
    machines, unless you have copied it to a write-protected diskette
    before the system became infected. Although TbScan performs a
    sanity check on invocation, there are some viruses that are able to
    fool a self-check, and TbScan might therefore carry such a virus
    without detecting it itself.


  5.3.  Identification

    Identify the virus. This is extremely important because if you know
    which virus infected your system, you know what the virus must have
    done there, and whether or not your data files can still be relied
    upon.

    You can use a virus scanner to identify a virus. Once you know the
    name of the virus you should obtain additional information about
    the virus.  Log on to our support BBS, consult literature on this
    subject, or consult a virus expert.

    If the virus only infects executable files you need only replace
    executable files. But if the virus swaps some bytes at a random
    location of your hard disk each time you execute a program, you
    have to replace your data files too, even though you didn't notice
    any changes in the data files themselves.


  5.4.  Don't Panic!

    The most important thing to do is NOT TO PANIC! Panicking doesn't
    help you, as you need to be calm to deal with the situation
    properly.  In most cases of virus infection in the past, most of
    the damage was done by the operator of the system, not by the virus
    itself. Do nothing at all except for identifying the virus and
    obtaining information about it. An instant reformat of your hard
    disk(s) is the worst thing you can do. Once you know exactly what
    the virus does, you can work out a strategy to recover from the
    infection.

    DO NOT MAKE A NEW BACK-UP OF YOUR SYSTEM THAT WILL OVERWRITE AN
    ALREADY EXISTING BACK-UP. Make a separate back-up instead and label
    it as being infected and unreliable.

 Thunderbyte Anti Virus v5.00 (C) 1989-1992 Thunderbyte B.V.



  5.5.  Global recovering

    When recovering from a virus infection it is important that you
    boot from an uninfected write-protected DOS diskette. Do NOT run
    any program from your hard disk! The virus must be denied access to
    your memory while you clean up the system.

    Restore the DOS system and bootsector by using the DOS SYS command.

    In case of a file virus, restore all executables. A virus removal
    utility is not recommended unless you don't have a back-up of the
    uninfected executable files. Depending on the kind of virus it
    might also be necessary to replace all data files.

    If the system has been infected by a virus that modifies the
    partition table it might be necessary to perform a low-level
    reformat of your hard disk(s). If you used a utility to back up the
    partition table (like TbRescue) it isn't necessary to reformat the
    disk(s). TbRescue restores the partition table for you.

    Once the system has been cleaned, check all diskettes, back-ups,
    etc. One infected diskette can cause you the same trouble all over
    again. Therefore we highly recommend you to take measures to
    protect your system against re-infections, since there is always
    the possibility that you forgot to clean up one of your diskettes.
    Use a virus scanner frequently, install a resident scanner (like
    TbScanX), or even better, install the Thunderbyte PC Immunizer card.
