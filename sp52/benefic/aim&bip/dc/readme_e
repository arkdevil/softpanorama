            Welcome to DOS Configurator ver. 1.0
            ------------------------------------

    11 years is a very serious age for an operating  system,
but a lot of users of MS-DOS still don't seem to give it up.
And everyone tries to  make DOS easier and  more comfortable
to use.
    Almost every serious  PC user, has,  as a rule,  several
pairs  of  autoexec.bat  and  config.sys  files  on  his HD,
describing particular DOS configurations optimized for  say,
Windows, or for DesqView with EMS emulator, or for Borland's
environments  with  free  XMS memory,  with  disk caching or
without it, etc.   And there is a  native problem :   how to
support range of configurations for all of your purposes and
how to activate  configuration you need  and do it  fast and
convenient.
    Authors try  range of  solutions of  this problem,  e.g.
User menu in Norton Commander or sys-drivers on system boot.
That's why we  decide to create  this utility.   Here's DOS
Configurator.

    Now let's list the main principles of DC :

    1. Any configuration  is implemented in  form :   <name>
and <handle>, where <name> is text string which is displayed
in main menu of DC and the <handle> is used in configuration
files (*.DC - files).

    2. You  must  create files  autoexec.dc  and  config.dc,
where  all  of  your  configurations  are  described.    For
example, if you want to have choice between command.com  and
ndos.com command processors you can write in config.dc :

   ##switch             - like C language operator
      ##case com        - "com" is configuration handle
        shell = c:\dos\command.com /p /e:256
      ##case ndos       - "ndos" is configuration handle
        shell = c:\nu\ndos.com /e:256 /s:dc:\nu
   ##end                - end of SWITCH operator

    To  learn  more  about  DC  language  please  refer   to
appropriate topic of help system.

    3. During the configuration activating the configuration
files are  translating to  appropriate .bat  and .sys files.
All   SWITCH   and   IF   constructions  are  changing  with
appropriate  branches  and  all  instances of variable names
will be replaced with their values.

    Now let's look at one example of autoexec.dc file (say,
you have WIN and CPP configurations) :


   rem -------- AUTOEXEC ---------
   ##var addpath
     ##WIN c:\windows
     ##CPP c:\bc\bin
   ##end
     prompt $P$G
     path c:\ut;c:\nu;c:\dc;##addpath
     cd ##addpath
   ##if WIN
     win
   ##end

    After translation  with WIN  configuration you  will get
autoexec.bat like this :

     rem -------- AUTOEXEC ---------
     prompt $P$G
     path c:\ut;c:\nu;c:\dc;c:\windows
     cd c:\windows
     win
