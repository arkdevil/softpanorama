   Here are examples of DC configurations (real configurations of
one  of  the  authors).    Copy  this  four  files  (AUTOEXEC.DC,
CONFIG.DC, DC.DAT and DC.INI) to home directory of DC.
   By  initial  setting  in  DC.INI  file  in  examples directory
AUTOEXEC.BAT &  CONFIG.SYS will  be placed  in current  directory
(instead of  c:\) -  so you  can "play"  with DC examples without
danger of overwriting your original AUTOEXEC.BAT & CONFIG.SYS.
