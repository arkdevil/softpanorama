BAD4ZIP.DOC is a file which can not be imploded using PKZIP version 1.10.  
WONTEXTR.DOC is the result of imploding BAD4ZIP.

All of the other archivers I have tested will handle this file properly.  
It appears to correctly implode, but on extraction, will fail the CRC test 
every time.

The file contains only ASCII characters, no carriage returns or other
such items.  This file is mostly a curiosity, as PKZIP version 1.93 will
correctly implode and extract it.  But the question remains, WHY?
