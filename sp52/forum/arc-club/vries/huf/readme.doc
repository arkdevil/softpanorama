-----------------------------

   The following files are included:


   HUFF1.C       C source code for Huffman Code compression program.

   HUFF1.EXE     Executable Huffman Code compression program compiled
                 under Lattice C V6.0.

   DHUFF.C       C Source code for Huffman Code decompression program.

   DHUFF.EXE     Executable Huffman Code decompression program compiled
                 under Lattice C V6.0.

   README.DOC    This file.


       ** These programs were compiled using the command:
                        lc -O -L -aw -ciust -d0 -n -ml <program name>


   I believe that these programs are "portable" enough to be recompiled using
   another C compiler without too much trouble.

   Please feel free to modify, improve, etc. these programs as you see fit.
   They are hereby placed in the public domain. Being interested in
   compression techniques, I would like to see any modifications, improvements,
   etc. (Variable code sizes, etc.)
