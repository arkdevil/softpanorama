                                Recent history

View Version 8.6
================

ADDED: Support for Ami Pro. Note that because I do not use this word
       processor myself, I may not have caught all the formatting
       possibilities. If you have a file that doesn't display properly
       please send it to me and I will try to correct the problem.

       Support for code page 850 (European). VIEW now looks for which
       code page is active - 437 (North America) or 850. It chooses the
       appropriate one for displaying high-order characters. If the active
       code page is neither 437 nor 850, it defaults to 437.

       Support for viewing large files. If you try to read a file that is
       too big for VIEW, the program now spills the overflow into a
       temporary file. You can easily switch between the first part of
       the file you want to view and its overflow, without exiting to
       the file selection menu.

REMOVED: "split large file" function. Removed because you can get a more
         logical series of places to split a file by converting it to
         ASCII from VIEW's file selection menu and then splitting it
         manually from a text editor.


VIEW Version 8.61
=================
         Expanded code page 850 support for WordPerfect 6.0 and tidied up
         MS Word display.

VIEW Version 8.62
=================
         Corrected error that caused some video cards to operate only in
         25 line mode even when they were capable of operating in other
         modes (e.g. 36 lines)

VIEW Version 8.7
================
         Added a direct link to Tony Caine's JETCOL and 2COL printing
         utilities to allow the user of VIEW to specify command line
         options.

VIEW Version 9.0 and 9.0a
=========================
         Made substantial improvements to file selection menu, including a
         help screen.  Added facility to change column wrap. Added support
         for viewing Wordstar files.  Improved display options and
         identification routines for files of "unknown format".  Improved
         the direct link to JETCOL/2COL, including printing large files
         directly from the file selection menu.

         Moved the "direct access to 2COL/JETCOL" key to F8, thereby
         disabling the "print screen" function; the equivalent is available
         by printing a marked block.

VIEW Version 9.1
================
         Added "/mem" command line switch to allow user to allocate
         (temporarily) more memory for link to JETCOL and 2COL.

VIEW Version 9.2
================
         Added partial support for WinWord 6.
         Changed the menu interface to enable an escape function for each
         menu item.  Improved the printer selection interface and modified
         the configuration program to allow the setting of a default
         printer port.  Added a function to change drive from the file
         selection menu.

VIEW Version 9.2a
=================
         Corrected bug that caused erroneous display of first part of files
         that are too big to be displayed in full even with the overflow
         file.  Improved the "select text string to find" interface.  Added
         asterisk (*) to bottom right hand corner of screen when text
         search function is enabled.

VIEW Version 9.2b
=================
         Corrected bug that caused ASCII files to report "unknown format"
         after viewing short (less than one screen) ASCII file.  Corrected
         bug that prevented WRITE files that begin with an OLE link from
         displaying properly.  Changed " xx bytes read" during file read to
         show percentage read instead.  Corrected typographical errors (!!)
         in configuration file interface.

VIEW Version 9.2c
=================
         Added function to escape from corrupted WordPerfect files after
         printing as much of them as possible to file.

VIEW Version 9.3
================
         Completely redesigned algorithm for decoding Word for Windows 6
         files.  NOTE: these files are OLE 2 and are very complex.  Not all
         such files may be displayed properly.  VIEW will attempt to detect
         what it thinks are "abnormal" WFW 6 files and display them as best
         it can.

         Added 132 column mode functionality.  If you wish to run in this
         mode you must set VIEW to use the video parameters it detects (via
         the configuration program: set the video display parameter to 0
         or 1);


VIEW Version 9.4
================
         Enhanced the 132 column mode by adding "emulated" 132 column
         display.  In this, if you are running 80 columns on screen, 132
         columns of text are available for viewing on each line by using
         the left and right cursor arrow keys.  This feature allows you to
         print documents with more than 80 columns (for example, program
         listings) without forced line wraps.  It also provides
         compatibility with a new feature in the registered version of
         JETCOL 3.3 (print in landscape mode).  As before, the actual
         column at which line wrap occurs can be reset on the fly from the
         file selection menu.


VIEW Version 9.5
================
         Added functions to print or convert a file directly without first
         viewing it.  Added functions for setting basic HP and
         HP-compatible printer modes (portrait and landscape, normal and
         compressed print) for those printers that recognize the PCL4
         command set.  Added ability to define column width (from 20
         to 132 characters) for display.

         NOTE: please read the documentation file.  The /132 and /132m
               switches introduced in version 9.4 have been replaced by
               /wnnn and /xnnn (where nnn is a three digit number between
               020 and 132).

VIEW Versions 9.5a-c
====================
         Maintenace releases.

VIEW Version 9.6
================

Added ability to convert between ASCII and ANSI character sets.  This
enables you to view Windows NOTEPAD files and others that use the ANSI
character set for high order characters (e.g.  é, â, ô).  Conversion from
ANSI can be toggled from the file menu or on the fly while a file is being
viewed.  Conversion to ANSI can be done on the fly.  NOTE: this has meant
that the function key F10, formerly used on the view screen menu for exiting
the menu, has been changed to space bar; F10 and Shift-F10 are now used for
the ASCII-ANSI conversions.  Changed the "show memory parameters" key on
the file list screen from ?  to m, for compatibility wih European and other
non-US keyboards. Added a user-definable command for initialising printer.
