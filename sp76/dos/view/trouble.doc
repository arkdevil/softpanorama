PROBLEMS WITH VIEW 9.6?
========================================================================

PROBLEM: You try to print a file via JETCOL or 2COL but nothing happens -
the display just returns to the VIEW screen.

POSSIBLE REASONS:

1. You don't have JETCOL or 2COL!

2. You have JETCOL or 2COL, but you have not left enough memory free for it
to run. Go to the configuration program VW95CFG.COM and reconfigure VIEW to
have at least 50 memory blocks reserved. You may get away with 49, you may
need 51 - experiment!  ALTERNATIVELY: re-run VIEW using the /mem command
line switch to allocate (temporarily) more memory for JETCOL/2COL.

3.  You have JETCOL or 2COL, and you have enough memory allocated for it,
but it is not referenced in your PATH statement.  Either edit your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file to put the drive and directory where you keep JETCOL or
2COL in the path, or, from VIEW, enter the full path when asked to enter
your command line parameters.

========================================================================


PROBLEM: VIEW behaves in a strange fashion - keys don't work, or the
display is garbled.

POSSIBLE REASONS:

1. The VIEW.EXE file has become damaged. Re-install from the ZIP file.

2. You have not allocated enough memory blocks. The configuration program
allows you to go as low as 8, but that may not be enough. Try increasing
the memory allocation units reserved until VIEW works properly. The number
may depend on how much memory you have installed on your system, what TSRs
you have running, whether or not not you are running under a network, for
example. I find that allocating 12 units allows VIEW to run without
problems.

3.  You have configured VIEW for fast display but you have an
incompatible video card (this is more and more unlikely unless you
have an old card, or a card in an AT&T or Olivetti machine).
Reconfigure VIEW to disable fast video.

4.  You see "snow" on the screen.  This means you have configured
for fast video but your video card is just not fast enough to keep
up with the display (this happens with CGA cards).  Reconfigure VIEW
to disable fast video display.

========================================================================

PROBLEM: VIEW does not properly decode Word for Windows 6 files.

REASON: I have developed an algorithm for decoding WinWord 6 files, but
these files are very complex. Please report any problems you might have.

========================================================================

PROBLEM: I am running VIEW on a 132 column screen but the menu display does
         not properly clear when I exit the menu.

REASON: As shipped, VIEW is "hard wired" not to try to detect what display
        parameters you are using (i.e.  rows and columns).  This is because
        there are some video cards that apparently do not use standard
        means for reporting their current mode.  Configure VIEW, using the
        configuration program, to use "fast video".  In this mode, VIEW
        does query your video card to get its current display mode.
