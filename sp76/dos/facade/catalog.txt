* 1995 Evaluation Disks Catalog *
----------------------------------


RCCO Research is a leading publisher of user-supported software products
offering one of the largest catalogs of original programs in that genre
for DOS and Windows users.

Our objects-oriented technology software products are now available from
more than 400 user-supported software disk dealers in the United States,
plus countless BBS's and information networks throughout the world and
are widely available on several of the major CD-ROM disk editions.

Disk duplication fees charged by the various vendors provide fully-
functional evaluation copies but do not include registration, which may
be purchased separately from RCCO Research after evaluation.

Commercial versions of some products may preclude those titles being
available as evaluation copies in some countries (including the United
States).  All RCCO Research programs are copyrighted and most titles are
trademarks.

A partial catalog of current offerings appears below.  Other, older titles
are still available and supported; they are not listed herein since they
have not had recent revisions and are not currently scheduled for future
updates.  Please consult your favorite user-supported software source for
the availability of current DOS and Windows(tm) programs from RCCO
Research.

Since we are constantly adding new titles and making revisions to our
catalog, this listing may be considered out-of-date if the filedate for
the catalog.txt file is more than 12 months old.
