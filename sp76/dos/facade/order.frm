Please complete the order form with your text editor and print it out.

You may also order with a note or letter that includes your name, organiza-
tion name, address, program name & version, number of users being licensed,
and remittance.  We would appreciate knowing where you obtained your copy
of this program; we utilize this information on your source for future

International clients must pay by check or money order in U.S. dollars, drawn
on a U.S. bank or the U.S. branch of an international bank.  Please realize
that international postal money orders are considerably delayed through the
postal systems and may not be the most expedient way of relaying payment.  An
often-used form of payment consists of obtaining a dollar-denominated money
order from the local American Express office which you may then airmail to
us along with your order.  International orders are dispatched promptly when
using a credit card order as outlined below.
