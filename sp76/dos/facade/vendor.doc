                                 Facade(tm)
                            -------------------
 
         developers' pcx splashscreen display for DOS applications

                                   v1.2


Facade(tm) is a simple loader program that allows DOS executable applications
to display a developer-designed VGA .pcx file as a sign-on image.  Upon
normal execution of the main application, Facade releases itself from
memory, thus adding no overhead to the executable sequence.

The splashscreen displays for four seconds, then calls the main executable
just as it would have been executed from the system prompt.

Facade may be used with most traditional MS-DOS language executables,
including those created with CA-Clipper, Borland Turbo Pascal, QuickBASIC,
PowerBasic, Visual Basic(tm) for DOS, dBase, Clarion, C, etc.  Unlike other
programs of this type, Facade may actually work well in professional
development environments.

Facade image displays will run under both DOS and Windows.  The utility
is particularly effective for software developers preparing copyright or
other splashscreens of their products, in that they can easily capture usable
materials with programs like Hijaak(tm) for Windows and modify or create them
in editing programs such as Windows(tm) Paintbrush.

Sample files and on-disk documentation are included.  The full registration
fee is only $24.95 (single-user system).


Program Requirements
---------------------
The requirements for running Facade include a DOS-compatible PC with 512k
memory, VGA graphics capability, and a hard drive.  DOS 3.1 (or later) or
Windows 3.x (or later) should be utilized.



[ Please note there is a similarly-named version of Facade called Facade-C
(Facade for Clipper), also from RCCO Research, which is specifically designed
for developers using CA-Clipper(R).  The present version of Facade will also
work well with Clipper, but we must point out the similar names to help avoid
confusion about the two products. ]
