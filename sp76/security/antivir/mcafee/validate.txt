VALIDATE is a file-authentication program that may be used to check
other programs for signs of tampering.  VALIDATE uses two discrete
methods to generate Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC's), which are then
displayed for the user to compare against the known value for the
program(s) validated.  The known validation data can be published by
the author of the program or be obtained from a trusted information
database.  The dual CRC checking provides a high degree of security.

     To confirm that a program is in its original, untampered state,
run the VALIDATE program on it, record the validation data produced,
and compare it against the record in the online database.  If they
match, than it is highly improbable that the program has been modified.

To run VALIDATE, type:

     VALIDATE <path spec>

where <pathspec> is the name of a file or directory.  The wildcard
characters, "*" and "?", may be used when specifying <pathspec>/

The VALIDATE program will then display the following information:

                <name of directory>

                name of file (starting at row 1)
                │
                │ extension of file (starting at row 10)
                │ │
                │ │ size of file (starting at row 15)
                │ │ │
                │ │ │ date of file (starting at row 25)
                │ │ │ │
                │ │ │ │ time of file (starting at row 35)
                │ │ │ │ │
                │ │ │ │ │ check method 1 (starting at row 44)
                │ │ │ │ │ │
