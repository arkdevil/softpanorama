TITLE: 941212 COULD NOT LOCATE VROBJ.DLL (OS/2 WARP BONUSPAK)

DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:

    Customer is attempting to run the BonusPak Installation
    Utility (INSTALL.CMD).  The program starts up and issues
    five "1 file(s) copied" messages and then pops up an error
    box that states: " BPIU.EXE - COULD NOT LOCATE VROBJ.DLL ".

SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION:

    Somehow the customer's LIBPATH statement has been changed
    such that the ".;" (dot semicolon) has been deleted from
    the LIBPATH.  The LIBPATH statement in CONFIG.SYS should
    look similar to this: LIBPATH=.;C:\OS2\DLL;C:\OS2\MDOS;
    continuing on to the end.  NOTE: C is drive where OS/2
    Warp is installed.

DETAILS OF RESOLUTION:

    If your customer is experiencing this error with the
    BonusPak Installation Utility, have the customer check
    his CONFIG.SYS file and look for the .; in the LIBPATH
    statement.  It normally should be the first entry in
    the list of subdirectories.  On a newly installed machine
    it is the first item.  It may however be located anywhere
    on the LIBPATH= line.  Ask the customer if he might have
    edited this line in his CONFIG.SYS or installed any
    applications that stated that they were going to edit
    or update CONFIG.SYS.  That will be the way to determine
    how the line might have gotten modified.  OS/2 Warp needs
    the .; in the LIBPATH to function correctly.

    A missing .; in the LIBPATH can result in all sorts of
    errors occurring with different programs of the BonusPak
    and the system in general.
