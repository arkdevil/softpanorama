TITLE: 950124 INSTALLING WARP, ON THE FIRST PHASE, SYSTEM LOGO AND              
              THEN BLINKING CURSOR.                                             
                                                                                
DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:                                                        
    After the first phase of installation, bootup the system, pass the          
    WARP LOGO, then a black screen with a blinking cursor.                      
    Use ALT+F1 and C to try to get to the command line, still gets a            
    blinking cursor.                                                            
                                                                                
SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION:                                                          
    This is a BASEDEV conflict.  Please check the CONFIG.SYS on the root        
    directory after the first phase of installation (ie, bootup from            
    Installation disk and F3 out from Disk #1).  Go to the drive where          
    OS/2 is installed.  Use TEDIT to edit the CONFIG.SYS on harddrive.          
    Check the CONFIG.SYS for duplicate statements.  Remarks/deletes out         
    the unneccessary BASEDEV statements that are not needed for the             
    installation.                                                               
                                                                                
DETAILS OF RESOLUTION:                                                          
    Note:  If the system boot up and get the LOGO and then a blinking           
           cursor user can check a couple of issues:                            
      Use the ALT+F1 routine and choose C to go to the command line.            
      If the system boots and get the command line on the harddrive,            
      this indicates the problem is video related.                              
      If the system boots and does not come up to the command line,             
      this indicates the problem is base device drivers conflict.  This         
      includes duplicate statements on the CONFIG.SYS.
