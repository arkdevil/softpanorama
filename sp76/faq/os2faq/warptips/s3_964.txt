TITLE: 941103 INSTALLING S3964 DRIVERS ON WARP OS/2 VERSION 3.0 USING
              S3'S DRIVERS (THOSE WRITTEN BY S3 CORP.)

DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:

    Problems installing the S3 drivers for the S3 964 chip on system with
    OS/2 v3.0
        1.  The install does not finish
        2.  The install hangs

SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION:

    1.  Edit the S3inst.cmd file
    2.  Change all references to x:\os2 to x:\os2\boot.
         (X: = drive where os2 resides)
    The drivers in original format will not install because the reference
    the Os2 directory.  Os2 v 3.0 installs the drivers into the Os2\Boot
    directory.

DETAILS OF RESOLUTION:

    1.  Edit the S3INST.CMD file by:
         a.  Place the S3 driver diskette into the disk drive.
         b.  Change to the disk drive
         c.  Pull S3INST.CMD into an editor
    2.  Change the reference from X:\OS2 TO X:\OS2\BOOT
         ('X' = drive where OS/2 resides)
         Note: The drivers in the original format will not install since
                 reference is to the \OS2 directory.  OS/2 v3.0 installs
                 drivers into the \OS2\BOOT directory
