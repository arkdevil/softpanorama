TITLE: 950116 OS/2 WARP NOT RECOGNIZING SONY 31A CDROM WHICH IS
              ATTACHED TO A CARDINAL DSP16 (SOUNDBLASTER COMPATIBLE)

DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:
OS/2 WARP does not recognize the SONY 31A which is connected to the
Cardinal DSP16 card.  Installation asks for the CD but keeps looping
and ask for the CD again and again.

SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION:
User is using downloaded driver (SONY31A.ADD) and followed the parameter
from page 329 example 4 of the user's guide.  As default, the sound
port address is 220h and IRQ 5.  The CDROM is set for port address 300
and IRQ 12.
User should use the driver that came with OS/2 WARP and added the
following to the SONY31A.ADD statement:
SONY31A.ADD /A:0 /AT:05 /P:0300 /I:12 /V
where the port address and irq above should be for the cdrom, NOT
the soundcard.  The /P: is the address of the cdrom and the /I: is the
IRQ of the CDROM drive.  (the /v only showed us if the cdrom was
recognized when the driver loaded or not).

Note:  the above problem is happen if user put the wrong port address
       and irq for the cdrom.
