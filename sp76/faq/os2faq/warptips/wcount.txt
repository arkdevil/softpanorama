TITLE: 950131 A:\COUNTRY.SYS IS INCORRECT ON DISK #1 WHEN INSTALLING
              OS/2 WARP.
 
DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:
    Installing OS/2 WARP, on disk #1 encountered " A:\country.sys
    is incorrect ".
 
RESOLUTION:
    Check the CMOS.  If the user has changed the floppy drives
    around, make sure the CMOS is setup correctly.
    Example, if the user switch 1.44mb drive from B to A, and 1.2mb
    drive from A to B, CMOS must be setup and change that reflect
    the A drive as 1.44mb and B drive as 1.2mb.
Note:
    Some floppy drives controller has the ability to override the
    cmos.  This means that the card is set for the original setup.
    For example, if the card is setup for 5 1/4" as A: drive and
    the user switched the 3 1/2" drive to become A: drive and go into
    the cmos and change it, when bootup, the card will override
    the setup on the cmos and still make the 5 1/4" as A:.
    Advice user to check the controller manual to disable this option
    on the card.  Or refer him/her back to where they bought the
    controller card.
