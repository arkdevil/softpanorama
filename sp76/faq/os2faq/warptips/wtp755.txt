TITLE: 950125 INSTALL PCMCIA ON IBM THINKPAD 755CD FROM WARP,                   
              UNABLE TO ACCESS THE INTERNAL IDE CDROM                           
                                                                                
DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:                                                        
 IBM ThinkPad 755CD which has an IDE CDROM.  User loaded the                    
 PCMCIA drivers from OS/2 WARP.  Afterwarp, shutdown and reboot the             
 system, user is unable to access the internal IDE CDROM device.                
                                                                                
RESOLUTION:                                                                     
 From the problem determination, this is an IRQ conflict.                       
 Change the PCMCIA IRQ setting.  To do this, add the following                  
 parameters to BASEDEV=IBM2SS01.SYS:                                            
  " BASEDEV=IBM2SS01.SYS /S0=1 /C0=11 "                                         
 Use IRQ 11 because it was an open IRQ.                                         
 Shutdown and reboot and the user should be able to access both                 
 the PCMCIA and the internal IDE CDROM device.                                  
                                                                                
 Note above that it is not neccessary to use IRQ 11.  User should               
 be able to find an IRQ that is available.
