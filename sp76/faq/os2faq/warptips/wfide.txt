TITLE: 950203 FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE IDE CD-ROM DRIVE
 
USERS:  All users of PCs with IDE CD-ROM drives
 
DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:
    Failure to recognize CD-ROM drive.
 
    Installing or booting OS/2 Warp on a system with an IDE CD-ROM
    drive, a red screen appears as the system is initializing the
    OS2CDROM.DMD device manager.  During installation, device managers
    are initialized during the processing of Disk 1.  The message
    indicates that there is no CD-ROM drive support.
 
SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION:
    If an IDE CD-ROM drive and an IDE hard drive share a disk
    controller, then the user should ensure that the hard drive is
    configured as the master and the CD-ROM drive is configured as the
    slave.
 
    **BUT**  If the CD-ROM drive and the hard drive are on separate
    disk controllers, then the user should ensure that both drives are
    configured as masters.
 
DETAILS OF RESOLUTION:
    Any pair of IDE drives that shares a controller should be setup in a
    master-slave configuration.  There must, however, be one master per
    controller in order for the drive on that bus to be recognized.
    These rules apply for any operating system, but they have only
    begun to cause CD-ROM problems for OS/2 as of the Warp release,
    the first release to include IDE CD-ROM drive support.
 
    For example, if the system has an IDE CD-ROM drive on its PCI bus
    and an IDE hard drive on its ISA bus, then both the CD-ROM drive
    and the hard drive should be configured as masters.  If the CD-ROM
    drive is swapped to the ISA bus at a later date, so that it shares
    a disk controller with the IDE hard drive, then the user must
    reconfigure the CD-ROM drive as a slave.
 
    Note that any such combination of drives requires both the
    IBMIDECD.FLT device driver and the IBM1S506.ADD device driver.  If
    two disk controllers are present, the BASEDEV= statement for the
    IBM1S506.ADD driver needs the parameter /A:0 to indicate the
    primary controller or /A:1 to indicate the secondary controller.
    For more information about these and other parameters, enter...
 
       HELP IBM1S506.ADD
 
    ...or...
 
       HELP IBMIDECD.FLT
 
    ...at an OS/2 command line.
 
    The user should refer to their hardware's documentation or call the
    manufacturer's tech support line to find out how to reconfigure
    their drive as a master or slave.
 
    Note:  If the user is able to install OS/2 from the CD-ROM drive,
           then the drive is configured correctly.  Therefore, if the
           CD-ROM drive is not recognized when OS/2 is booted later,
           then the user may need to simply add the statement...
 
             BASEDEV=x:\OS2\BOOT\IBMIDECD.FLT
 
           ...to the CONFIG.SYS file.
