TITLE: 950130 Installing from CDROM, using device drivers other
              than IBM supplied drivers. (WARP)
 
DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:
    If the user is installing from a drive other
    than A: (e.g.  CDROM), and a device driver
    that does not exist on DISK #1 (note: user has
    the device driver file from the vendor), the install
    process will not copy this file onto the
    hardfile after the installation is complete. The
    cause of this problem is because if the user could
    not boot with the drivers that are present on the
    hardfile, then he will have to boot from
    diskettes or another partition, then copy the device
    driver file over.
 
RESOLUTION:
    Development has added an environment variable called
    copyfromfloppy that the installation program will
    read from CONFIG.SYS on diskette #1.  If the
    CONFIG.SYS has the statement " set copyfromfloppy=1 ", then
    the installation program will copy files from
    disk #1 if the diskette is in the drive, and the
    installation is from a drive other than A:.
