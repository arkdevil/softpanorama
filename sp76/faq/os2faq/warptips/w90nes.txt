TITLE: 950126 ERROR " NOT ENOUGH SPACE ON HARD DISK " WITH 8590
              WITH NEC CDROM CONNECTED ( SCSI I )
 
SYMPTOMS:
    On disk #1, error msg " Not Enough Hard Disk Space to
    Install ... "
    Note:  This is a CD-ROM installation.  User boots up on the
    Installation disk and when prompt, puts in the disk #1 of the
    cdrom.
    No doublespace on the harddrive.  Only DOS/Windows.
    FDISK did not see any "strange partitions", if it shows, this
    indicates that there is a "monkeys" virus.
 
RESOLUTION:
    User has upgraded the EPROM for this 8590 and changed the
    NEC CDROM to set it SCSI I, since the IBM SCSI controller is
    SCSI I compliant.
