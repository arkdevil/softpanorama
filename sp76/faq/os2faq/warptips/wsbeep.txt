TITLE: 950130 SYSTEM BEEPS ON DISK #7 AFTER THE SYSTEM
              CONFIGURATION SCREEN WHEN INSTALLING WARP
 
DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:
    Installation of WARP, system beeps on disk #7.
 
RESOLUTION:
    Have the user check on the system for back level drivers.
    Example, we found that an OS/2 2.11 IBM1FLPY.ADD on the
    root directory and other 2.11 device drivers that somehow
    are got there.
    Please note that most 2.11 drivers are dated 1/29/94.  If
    the user find device drivers that are dated around this above
    date, it is 2.11 drivers.
    User needs to delete these device drivers off the system.
