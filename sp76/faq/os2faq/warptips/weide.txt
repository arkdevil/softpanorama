* IBM Systems with translated BIOS include Valuepoint and IBM
  Mobile

** On Track will have a OS/2 filter that provides translation at
   Warp ship.  This filter will be shipped with On Track other
   Enhanced IDE Utilities with WD and IBM hard files for use on
   systems that do not have translated BIOS.  In the meantime
   we have worked with On Track to have FDISK identify the
   signature (45H) to prevent corruption.
