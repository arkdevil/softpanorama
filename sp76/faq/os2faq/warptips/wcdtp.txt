TITLE: 950119 CDROM in ThinkPad DockII ( using AHA152X ) is not
              recognized.

DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:
 On IBM Thinkpad connected to Docking station II with cdrom connected to
 Adapted 1510,1520,1522 controller is not recognized after installation
 Trying to do selective install for cdrom system configuration shows no
 cdrom support which it did during initial installation, when he chooses
 cdrom as source directory program comes back with message invalid
 source directory.

SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION:
 PCMCIA drivers takes IRQ 11 on machine and IRQ 11 is default of the
 Adaptec SCSI adapter (in the docking station) and this IRQ conflict
 makes cd-rom unusable.

DETAILS OF RESOLUTION:
 Reconfigure SCSI card to IRQ 9 or to any other free IRQ through
 Dock II setup on bootup ( Control A ).
 Also Thinkpad has an IDE and on the docking station has a SCSI hard-
 disk, than move the SCSI driver statements before IDE driver statements
 in config.sys.
