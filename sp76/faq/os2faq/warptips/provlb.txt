TITLE: 941027 4030VL, Promise VLB Diskcaching Card IDE
              controller failed installing Warp.

DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:
    Even with cache disabled, the motherboard bios
    for disk I/O and all ide drives above 0 and 1
    disconnected a complete failure with the
    repeated message that drive C is not available
    and so forth all the way thru D and the logical
    drive partitions on both physical drives.
    Note: the above is an example if the user has 2 physical
    drives connected to this Promise card.

RESOLUTION:
    Get a newer driver available from the Promise BBS.
    The file is PTI1S506.ADD.  When using this, the
    IBM1S506.ADD must be remmed out first.  The older
    driver for DV4030VLIDE will not work.
