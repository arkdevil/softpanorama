TITLE: 941201 Philips cdrom causes boot problem if /m parameter used

DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:

    After setting the number of 2500 byte CD frame buffers to a value
    greater than the default value, OS2 will not boot. The default value
    is 16, the maximum 26, and the minimum 8. If customer is loading
    the LMS205.ADD driver, the line in config.sys would read

              BASEDEV=LMS205.ADD /m:26

    to specify 26 2500 byte CD frame buffers.
    With the Philips 206 cdrom, the line would read

              BASEDEV=LMS206.ADD /m:

SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION:

    Change the number of CD frame buffers back to the default value.

DETAILS OF RESOLUTION:

    Please follow these instructions:

    1. Bring up the OS2 config.sys in an editor.

    2. Check the config.sys for the statements

        BASEDEV=LMS205.ADD /m:26

    3. Remove the /m:26 so the line reads

        BASEDEV=LMS205.ADD

    4. Save the file, shutdown and reboot for the changes to take
       effect.
