TITLE: 941123 INSTALLING WARP ON A SYSTEM WITH FUTURE DOMAIN 1680,
              FIRST PHASE HANG WITH A BLINKING CURSOR.  NO LOGO
              ON THE FIRST REBOOT.

DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:
    Installing WARP on a system with Future Domain 1680 SCSI
    controller and Toshiba 3401b CDROM, hang after the first reboot
    with a blinking cursor on the top left hand corner.  No logo,
    just a black screen with blinking cursor. This is on a 1.5gb
    Maxtor hardfile.

SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION:
    User has low-level formatted the hardfile under the Future Domain
    utilities, but did not partition the drive and high-level
    format under this utilities.  The Maxtor drive cylinders set is
    incorrect, showing 816 instead of actual 1014 cylinders.  The
    hardfile was NOT correctly defined previously therefore causing
    this problem.

DETAILS OF RESOLUTION:
    Make sure the hardfile is correctly define and format under the
    Future Domain Utilities to avoid this problem.
