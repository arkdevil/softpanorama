TITLE: 941026 THE SWAPPER FILE IN WARP.
                                                                                
DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:                                                        
    The swapper file is larger in WARP than in previous releases of             
    OS2.                                                                        
                                                                                
SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION:                                                          
    This is normal.                                                             
                                                                                
DETAILS OF RESOLUTION:                                                          
    This is normal.                                                             
    The most significant change that has been made is how system DLL's          
    get loaded and what is now valid data for swapping.                         
    System DLL's include:                                                       
    DISPLAY          SOM          PMMERGE      PMWP                             
    DOSCALL1         PMATM        PMMLE                                         
    IBMDEV32         PMCTLS       PMSPL                                         
    IBMVGA32         PMGPI        PMVIOP                                        
                                                                                
    In the previous versions of OS/2, dll code was never copied to the          
    swapper file.  In WARP, code for system dll's can be written to             
    the swapper file and, in adition, during boot, PMMERGE, DOSCALL1,           
    PMGPI, PMWP and PMVIOP will be swapped out.  This means that there          
    will be an overall increase in swapper size.  This was done                 
    to increase overall system perfomance.
