SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION:
    See details resolution.
 
DETAILS OF RESOLUTION:
    The line in volume can be changed from zero to a nominal number
    by doing the following:
 
    1.   Download from Creative Labs BBS the OS/2 Mixer. Follow
         the readme on how to setup a program icon on the desktop
         for the Mixer. When the mixer is started adjust the Line
         In volume to your liking. You can save the settings and
         put the Mixer in the Startup folder. This will start when
         the machine boots up to the OS/2 Desktop. If this is not
         done the Line In volume will reset back to zero once the
         machine is cold booted.
 
    This will solve symptoms 1 and 2.
