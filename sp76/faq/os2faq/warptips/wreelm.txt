              A REEL MAGIC CARD UNDER OS/2 WARP 3.0
 
DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:
    Users installed Reel Magic support during the Multimedia installtion
    and cannot play back MPEG file using the Digital Video player.
 
SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION:
    See details of resolution.
 
DETAILS OF RESOLUTION:
    In order to playback MPEG files using a Reel Magic card in
    Multimedia you need to have installed Reel Magic support and
    be running at 640x480x256 colors.
 
    You must also have a supported video board with a VGA feature
    port located on the board. This is needed to connect the VGA pass
    thru from the video board to the Reel Magic card.
 
    Running 640x480x256 is a restriction on the Reel Magic card.
    Sigma Designs is currently looking into resolving this.
