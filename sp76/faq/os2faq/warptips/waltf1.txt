TITLE: 950110 USING ALT+F1 ROUTINE UNDER WARP ON A PRELOAD SYSTEM

DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:
    If a user has a preloaded system and excutes the ALT+F2 command,
    selecting the maintenance partition (M), some information in the
    \OS2\BOOT\CONFIG.M file may be incorrect for that particular preload
    system.  If the information is incorrect, when the install program
    is started, it may exit with an error indicating that the sourcepath
    incorrect.

RESOLUTION:
    To get around this problem, the user will have to edit the
    \OS2\BOOT\CONFIG.M file.  There are two "set" statements
    that will need to be changed:
          SET SOURCEPATH=drive:\path
          SET FDISKETTESOURCE= 0 or 1;
          0 if redirected from cd, remote or local drive
          1 if user will be prompted to insert diskettes
    If the user has not made a set of diskettes using their Diskette
    Factory program, then SOURCHPATH needs to points to
    C:\DISKETTS\OS2V3, and FDISKETTESOURCE should equal 0.
    If the user has made a set of installation diskettes and the install
    directory tree loaced under \DISKETTS\OS2V3 has been deleted by the
    Diskette Factory program, then SOURCEPATH should equal A: and
    FDISKETTESOURCE should be set
