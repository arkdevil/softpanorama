TITLE: 950111 WIN32S SUPPORT LIMITATIONS UNDER OS/2 3.0 WARP

DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:
    Versions of WIN32S above 1.1 are not supported under OS/2 V3.0

SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION:
    Check the version of WIN32S

DETAILS OF RESOLUTION:
    Any application which utilizes the 32 Bit API library "WIN32S"
    installs the version necessary for the application to run.
    A WIN32S.INI file is placed in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory
    and in it, the version of WIN32S is revealed.
    The README found in the root directory documents support for
    WIN32S being at versions 1.0 and 1.1. If the installed version is
    greater than 1.1, it is not supported.
