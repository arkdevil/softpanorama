TITLE: 950118 INSTALLING WARP ON AN APTIVA, AN IBM PC 300 AND 700
              SERIES MACHINES WITH 3.7MB OF MEMORY AND AN IDE CDROM
              RESULTS IN TRAP0003.

DESCRIPTION:
  Trap 3 can happen on IBM PC 300 Series - 486 Systems , IBM PC
  300 Series - Pentium System , IBM PC 700 Series - Pentium
  Systems and Aptiva machines with 3.7 meg of memory and an
  IDE CDROM

  The queueing mechanism in the IDE CDROM driver can cause
  a trap 3 during install if there is heavy swap activity.
  A fix must be applied to the OS/2 system to correct this
  problem.

How to apply the fix for a CD install.

OS/2 has two diskettes that are required to boot and initiate
an install from a CD.  The diskettes are called the "Installation"
diskette and "Diskette 1".  In the fixes sent to you will be a file
called IBMIDECD.FLT.  Copy this file to "Diskette 1" replacing the
original that was on the diskette.  Now go forth and do your
install as usual.  The new module will be used during the install
and it will be installed on the final system.

How to apply the fix for a diskette install.

Boot the Install diskette and go through the first part of install.
At the end of the first part of install, a blue screen with white
letters comes up telling the user to remove the diskette and press
enter to reboot and continue the install.  At this time, the user
must press the F3 button to get to a command line.  In the fixes
sent to you will be a file called IBMIDECD.FLT.  Copy this file
to the directory ?:\OS2\BOOT (? is the drive letter being installed
into) replacing the original.  Then enter EXIT to get you back to
the blue screen.  Now go forth and finish your install as usual.
the new module will be used during the install and it will be
installed on the final system.


The fix is AVAILABLE in the APTIVA UPDATE.  A replacement disk
will be sent.  For the CD-ROM version of WARP, a new Diskette #1
will be sent.  For the Diskette version, a new Diskette #2 will be sent.
Use this new diskette in place of the equivalent diskette that came
with OS/2 WARP.
