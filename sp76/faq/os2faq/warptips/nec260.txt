TITLE: 941114 Configuring the NEC 260 IDE cdrom under OS2 Warp.     
                                                                    
DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:                                            
    A NEC 260 IDE cdrom is not being recognized by OS2 Warp.        
                                                                    
SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION:                                              
    Make sure the proper drivers are loading in config.sys and      
    that the necessary files are located in the proper directories. 
                                                                    
DETAILS OF RESOLUTION:                                              
    If you have already installed OS2 Warp, and are trying to get   
               the cdrom recognized, follow these instructions:     
                                                                    
     1. Go to the OS2 Selective Install utility. From the list of   
        cdrom's, select the NEC 260. Click OK. At the System        
        Configuration window, click OK again. At the Setup and      
        Installation window, select the Install button.              
                                                                     
     2. Insert the OS2 diskette when prompted.                       
                                                                     
     3. Edit the OS2 config.sys in the root directory of the hard    
        drive. Find the line:                                        
                                                                     
                          BASEDEV=IBM1S506.ADD                       
                                                                     
        Add switches to this line so that it reads:                  
                                                                     
                          BASEDEV=IBM1S506.ADD /A:x /U:y /ATAPI      
                                                                     
        The /A switch refers to the adapter number that the cdrom    
        is attached to. The /U option references the unit or device  
        number on a particular adapter. The /ATAPI parameter         
        enables ATA Packet Interface protocol for the NEC 260. If the
        cdrom is attached to the second IDE port or adapter in a     
        system and is the only device on the adapter, you would enter
                                                                         
                          BASEDEV=IBM1S506.ADD /A:1 /U:0 /ATAPI          
                                                                         
        in the config.sys. If the cdrom is configured as a slave, or sec 
        device, you would specify /U:1. The config.sys should also conta 
        the statements:                                                  
                                                                         
                           BASEDEV=IBMIDECD.FLT                          
                           DEVICE=C:\OS2\BOOT\OS2CDROM.DMD               
                           IFS=C:\OS2\BOOT\CDFS.IFS                      
                                                                         
         These should have been added by the Selective Install program.  
                                                                         
         If you are trying to install Warp from the NEC 260 cdrom,       
         simply configure the BASEDEV=IBM1S506.ADD  line per above.      
         If you find that OS2 still does not recognize the cdrom,        
         make sure that the /A and /U parameters are specified
