TITLE: 950202 IPE  ## 1000 : 00000DBB - 0002 : 0DBB  60000, 2008
              INTERNAL REVISION 8.162 AFTER THE SECOND PHASE
              OF INSTALLATION OF WARP
 
SYMPTOMS:
    IPE after the second phase of the installation of WARP.
    *************** IPE 16/32-bit ***************
     THE SYSTEM DETECTED AN INTERNAL PROCESSING
     ERROR AT LOCATION # 1000:00000dbb - 0002:0dbb
     60000, 2008
     048600b4
     INTERNAL REVISION  8.162      94/09/19
    *********** end IPE 16/32-bit ***************
 
RESOLUTION:
  A couple of issues user needs to take a look at.
  1.  On the root directory, there are many files (excess of 200 plus
      files) that can cause this IPE.   User's needs to move these files
      to a temporary directory.  Check the WARP user's manual on
      setting up dualboot for more information.
      Under dualboot setup, it is suggested to move files from the
      root that are not needed before installation of OS/2.
  2.  On some Thinkpad systems, on the 2nd phase of installation,
      user has changed the mouse pointer instead of choosing default.
      User needs to leave it as default.
      To correct this problem, use the alt+f1 routine and choose M to
      the maintenance desktop and make sure the mouse pointer is
      set correctly for the Thinkpad.  Usually, it is set for
      default.
