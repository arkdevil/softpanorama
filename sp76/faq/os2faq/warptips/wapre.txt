TITLE: 950131 WARP AND OS/2 2.1 SE FOR WINDOWS CANNOT INSTALL ON
              APTIVA SYSTEMS WHICH ARE PRE-LOADED WITH DOS/WINDOWS
 
DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:
    During the installation of WARP and OS/2 2.1 SE for
    Windows, the user is prompted for WINDOWS diskettes.
    Aptiva systems which are delivered with DOS/WINDOWS
    pre-installed have no diskettes with which to finish
    the installation process. The WIN-OS/2 component is
    unable to install.
 
SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION:
    Edit SETUP.INF
 
DETAILS OF RESOLUTION:
    Three Files are used during installation of Windows which
    provide information necessary to properly install and
    maintain the Windows platform. The key file which Windows
    Setup uses to install the Windows system and it's
    application files is SETUP.INF (the other two are
    CONTROL.INF and APPS.INF).
 
    SETUP.INF by default, has 13 sections, one of which needs
    to be edited to enable the WIN-OS/2 component to install.
 
    The "DISKS" section describe disks which might be
    requested during installation and their characteristics.
    This section needs to be edited as follows to enable
    WIN-OS/2 support.
 
    In the .Disks. section the following statements appear:
        1 =. ,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #1",disk1
        2 =. ,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #2",disk2
        3 =. ,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #3",disk3
        4 =. ,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #4",disk4
        5 =. ,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #5",disk5
        6 =. ,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #6",disk6
 
    Edit these statements so they appear as follows
        1 =X:\windows\drivers,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #1",disk1
        2 =X:\windows\drivers,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #2",disk2
        3 =X:\windows\drivers,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #3",disk3
        4 =X:\windows\drivers,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #4",disk4
        5 =X:\windows\drivers,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #5",disk5
        6 =X:\windows\drivers,"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Disk #6",disk6
 
    where X= the drive where Windows is installed.
 
    This change  should be in place before installation, but can be
    made after to use with the SELECTIVE INSTALL feature
