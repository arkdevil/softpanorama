OSWAFAIL - WIN-OS2 SESSION FAILS TO START

================================================================
              WIN-OS2 SESSIONS FAILS TO START
================================================================

Please Read Entire Document for Full Explanation of Procedures
----------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOM:

  When starting any WIN-OS/2 session, the session ends before it
  starts.  If started from an ICON, it hatches then unhatches.
  If started from a command line, the "Loading Please Wait..."
  message appears, then the command prompt reappears.

  If starting a WIN-OS/2 session from a command line with a "/B"
  switch, the BOOTLOG.TXT file shows LOADSTART=MOUSE.DRV as the
  last statement in the file.


RESOLUTION:

  Check the MOUSE.INI file and ensure the MOUSETYPE= statement is
  the same as the mouse installed on the system.  The statement
  should read:

          MOUSETYPE=PS2        for a PS/2 mouse
          MOUSETYPE=SERIALx    Where x is the port being used by
                                  the mouse


  When running in DOS/WINDOWS, the system queries the hardware
  attached and updates MOUSE.INI.  This does not happen in OS/2.
  An APAR has been opened for the problem.
