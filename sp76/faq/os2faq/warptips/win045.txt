TITLE: 941121 INSTALLING WARP, GETTING SYS0045 ON WINDOWS DISK #1               
                                                                                
DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:                                                        
    Installing OS/ WARP passed the first phase and onto the second              
    phase of the installation, when asks to insert the WINDOWS                  
    DISK #1, will received a " SYS0045 sector can't be found ... "              
    If going into OS/2 and DIR on the WINDOWS DISKS, it is ok, but if           
    trying to copy, xcopy any files from the WINDOWS DISKS to the               
    hardfile, result the same error SYS0045 message.                            
                                                                                
SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION:                                                          
    User has changed the floppy drives around and did not update                
    the CMOS to reflects the changes.                                           
                                                                                
DETAILS OF RESOLUTION:                                                          
    User must go into the system CMOS and make sure the floppy                  
    drives are setup correctly.                                                 
    Example: If changed the 1.44mb drive from B: to A:, and the 1.2mb           
             drive from A: to B:, on the Setup on the CMOS should               
             reflect that 1.44mb as an A: drive and 1.2mb as an B:              
             drive.
