TITLE: 950128 SYS1174 AUDIO DEVICE IN USE BY ANOTHER PROCESS WHEN
              STARTING WINOS2 FULLSCREEN SESSION UNDER WARP 3.0
 
DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:
    Symptom 1.
 
        Sys1174 Audio device is being used by another process when
        starting Winos2 Fullscreen session under OS/2 Warp 3.0
 
    Symptom 2.
 
        Sys1174 Audio device is being used by another process when
        starting a Multimedia applet in the Multimedia folder under
        OS/2 Warp 3.0
 
    Symptom 3.
 
        Sys1174 Audio device is being used by another process when
        starting a Dos Fullscreen session under OS/2 WARP 3.0
 
SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION:
    See details of resolution.
 
DETAILS OF RESOLUTION:
    There several reasons why a SYS1174 is produced when starting
    a VDM or an application that requires the use of a sound card.
    Below you will find information to resolve the error message:
 
    1. Only one session can have access to the supported sound card at
       a time. Once a VDM or application grabs the audio device,
       AUDIOVDD.SYS located in the OS/2 config.sys will not allow
       another session to aquire the board. This is working as designed
       in which the VDD will protect the integrity of the session.
 
       Remarking the statement out in the OS/2 config.sys will allow
       allow multiple session to aquire the board but results are
       unpredictable. By doing this you will be in an unsupported
       enviroment.
 
    2. Make sure Fastload is not enabled in the Winos2 setup. This
       will start a Winos2 session whenever the machine is booted
       into OS/2. The session will aquire the card and no other
       Winos2 session will start resulting a SYS1174.
 
       To disable FASTLOAD start the Winos2 Setup program located
       in the System Setup folder. Disable FASTLOAD on the first page.
       Uncheck to disable. Then Shutdown and reboot.
 
    3. Make sure there are no Windows program located in the OS/2
       Startup folder and remove these.
 
    4. If using Wordperfect for Windows 6.xx make sure that there is
       no LOAD command to execute Wordperfect or a module in
       Wordperfect in the WIN.INI.
 
    5. A session may not have closed properly and the thread may
       still be left opened even though the window list shows nothing.
       Remove "Programs" from SET AUTOSTART in the OS/2
       config.sys and add a new line SET RESTARTOBJECTS=NO.
       Save and exit then shutdown and reboot.
 
    6. Make sure users are using the latest Windows 3.1 drivers for
       the supported sound cards. Also check to make there are NO
       IRQ/DMA and I/O conflicts within the machine. Also make
       sure that they are using the same IRQ/DMA and I/O settings
       in all three for all three enviroments:
 
       MMPM/2 - Multimedia Presentation Manager/2
       WINOS2 - Winos2 Fullscreen (VDM)
       DOS - DOS Fullscreen (VDM)
