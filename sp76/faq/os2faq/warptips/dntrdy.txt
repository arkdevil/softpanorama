TITLE: 941207 WARP ERROR MESSAGE "DRIVE X NOT READY PRESS ANY KEY"

DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:

    CUSTOMERS USING THE BOOT MANAGER FEATURE UNDER OS/2 WARP MAY GET
    THE ERROR MESSAGE "DRIVE 1 NOT READY PRESS ANY KEY" AND THE SYSTEM
    BOOTS NORMALLY. OTHER DRIVES NUMBERS MAY ALSO BE REPORTED AS NOT
    READY. THIS IS MOST PREVALENT ON COMPUTERS THAT UTILIZE A SCSI
    HOST ADAPTER.

SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION:

    THE CUSTOMER SHOULD CHECK THE HARDWARE SETTINGS OF ALL THE
    DRIVES IN HIS SYSTEM. ON SYSTEMS WITH SCSI HOST ADAPTERS, BE
    CERTAIN THAT ONLY BOOTABLE DRIVES HAVE A SCSI ID OF 0 OR 1.
    USING FDISK FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION OF OS/2 TO INSTALL THE
    BOOTMANAGER WILL CIRCUMVENT THE MESSAGE.

DETAILS OF RESOLUTION:

    THE ERROR MESSAGE APPEARING IS THE RESULT OF ADDITIONAL
    MESSAGEING THAT WAS ADDED TO ALERT A USER THAT AN EXTERNAL
    DRIVE MAY NOT BE POWERED ON. ONE OF THE REASONS THAT IT APPEARS
    FOR WARP USERS WITHOUT EXTERNAL DRIVES MAY BE A NON STANDARD
    IMPLENTATION OF THE BIOS IN THE USERS SCSI CARD. USING
    THE FDISK PROGRAM FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION OF OS/2 WILL STOP
    THE ERROR MESSAGE FROM APPEARING. FDISK.COM IS LOCATED ON DISK 1
    OF MOST VERSIONS OF OS/2 INSTALLATION DISKETTES, IT IS ALSO IN THE
    \OS2SE21\DISK_2 DIRECTORY OF MOST OS/2 CDROMS.
