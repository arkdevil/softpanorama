              IN OS/2 2.1 SE AND WARP

    SEE DETAILS
 
DETAILS OF RESOLUTION:
    Many Windows based Communications applications when installed,
    replace the default COMM.DRV to another driver. These drivers
    attempt to poll com ports in such a way that OS/2 will detect
    this polling and generate errors and terminate the app.
 
    If these symptoms present themselves, edit SYSTEM.INI. In the .BOOT.
    Section, notice the COMM.DRV section, if it equals ANYTHING but
    COMM.DRV, edit the statement accordingly so that
    COMM.DRV=COMM.DRV.
 
    The symptoms should disapper
