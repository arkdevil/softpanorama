TITLE: 950128 DMA TIMEOUT ERROR OR HANG WHEN STARTING WINOS2 FULL
              SCREEN SESSION UNDER WARP 3.0 WHEN USING CRYSTAL SEMI
              CHIP (CS4231) ON IBM THINKPADS.
 
DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:
    Symptom 1.
 
       When users install the Crystal Semi (cs4231) Winos2 drivers
       according to the Multimedia On Line Help a DMA Timeout error
       is produced when a Winos2 Fullscreen is started. The session
       may also hang even though the drivers have been installed
       properly.
 
SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION:
    See details of resolution.
 
DETAILS OF RESOLUTION:
    The native Windows drivers for the Crystal Semi chip (cs4231)
    have to be removed since they are VXD's. They are not supported
    under OS/2 WARP 3.0. The Multimedia On Line help does not refer
    to these drivers and their removal prior to installing the Winos2
    Crystal Semi Drivers. Please follow the steps below to remove:
 
    1. Locate and EDIT the Windows SYSTEM.INI file.
 
      a. Locate TPAUDVXD.386 in the 386ehn section.
         Remove this statement:
 
         Drivers=TPAUDVXD.DRV
 
      b. Locate IBMMME.DRV in the DRIVERS section.
         Remove these statements:
 
         Aux=IBMMME.DRV
         WAVE=IBMMME.DRV
         MIDI=IBMMME.DRV
 
    2.  Save and exit out of the Editor.
 
    You will now be able to start the Winos2 Fullscreen session
