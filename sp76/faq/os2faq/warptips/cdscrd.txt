TITLE: 941122 INSTALLING OS/2 WARP, INTERNAL CDROM DRIVE CONNECTED
              TO A SOUNDCARD DIRECTLY (NOT A SEPERATE CONTROLLER
              CARD).

DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:
    Not recognizing cdrom.  OS2CDROM.DMD not found.

RESOLUTION:
    This is a hardware related problem.  User needs to do the
    following:
    On the back of the cdrom drive is a jumper which controls the bus
    device number.  OS/2 install requires it to be on 0 (zero).
    Most sound board manufacturers leave it at the factory default
    of 1.  If it is anything other than 0, the install disk #1 will
    not load the driver " OS2CDROM.DMD " and will stop installation
    with a red screen saying it can't find the cdrom.
