TITLE: 950123 INSTALLATION WARP ON A PS/2 8580 WITH A CYRIX UPGRADE             
              CHIP, HANG ON DISK #1 WITH BLINKING CURSOR WITH                   
              THE DRIVE LIGHT ON.                                               
                                                                                
DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:                                                        
    Goes thru installation disk and prompts for disk #1 as normal.              
    Goes thru OS/2 logo, "loading please wait" panel and then                   
    screen turns blank, cursor goes in top left, floppy light stays on          
    and system appears to be hung.  Ctrl+Alt+Del does not work                  
    at this point and a hard reset has to be performed.                         
                                                                                
RESOLUTION:                                                                     
  This system is a PS/2 8580 with a Cyrix 486dx 20/40 Mhz, 16mb                 
  RAM, 4mb on the system board, and two memory cards consists of                
  4mb installed and one with 8mb.  Both cards had 85NS simms on them.           
  ALT+F2 routine showed that all the drivers were loading and installion        
  OS2DASD.DMD was last one to load and install, then the cursor went to         
  upper left corner and the system locked (cold boot needed).                   
  From problem determination, user has taken out the 4mb card and then          
  the 8mb card, user has find out that with the 8mb card out, the system        
  was able to install and pass the problem.                                     
  This is a hardware problem.                                                   
  Note:  Tried PJ16077 workaround, but was unsuccessful.
