TITLE: 941208 SHUTDOWN FAILS UNDER OS/2 2.11 OR WARP DUE TO LOTUS
              CC:MAIL BEING ON THE SYSTEM

DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:
    In some cases, after installing CCMail Client on a system running
    WARP 3.0, the user will be unable to successfully shutdown.

SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION:
    CCmail is aware of this and the 1.04 build will address this
    issue.

DETAILS OF RESOLUTION:
    To work around this problem:
        Make sure the user either has their CCMail folder open, or
        places a shadow of any object within the CCMail folder on the
        OS/2 desktop, prior to shutdown.

    ALSO, word from a Lotus support tech is that if the IN BOX has a
    shadow on the Desktop, then the problem will not occur.

    This problem will be addressed in the version 1.04 of CCmail.
    The most current version of CCMail Client is 1.03 and 1.04 is
    scheduled to be available early 1995.
