Trap on Final Reboot and every subsequent boot with above CS:EIP                
value.                                                                          
                                                                                
SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION:                                                          
Incorrect statements in CONFIG.SYS results in Trap and it is                    
resolved by copying the generic CONFIG.SYS to the root drive.
