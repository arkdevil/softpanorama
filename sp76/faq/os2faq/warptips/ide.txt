TITLE: 941209 WHAT IDE CD-ROMS ARE COMPATIBLE WITH OS2 Warp?
              AND HOW DO I MAKE THEM WORK?

DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:
    CDROM NOT WORKING UNDER WARP

SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION:
    What Follows is a list of CD-ROMs that are known to be compatible
    with Warp and how to make them work.

DETAILS OF RESOLUTION:

    The IDE hard disk driver, IBM1S506.ADD, was made aware of ATAPI.
    This driver will claim all ATAPI devices and mark them as generic
    devices. The IBMIDECD.FLT filter loads afterwards and scans all
    drivers for generic ATAPI devices. If it locates one, it will decide
    if that device is a CDROM.

    Note:  In addition to IBM1S506.ADD and IBMIDECD.FLT, all CD-ROM
    in the table below require the OS2CDROM.DMD and CDFS.IFS device
    These are added automatically when the selective install is done.

    CDROM.

    An IDE CDROM cannot be a master while a hard drive is being a slave.
    You cannot use the IBMINT13.I13 for an IDE CDROM.

    Notes:

    1. The Mitsumi and Sony cdroms may have problems because they are not
       ATAPI 1.2 compliant. This should be fixed with updated drivers.

    2. NEC 260 cdroms that ship with some Gateway systems adhere to the
       1.7 spec instead of 1.2. For these cdroms, the BASEDEV=IBM1S506. A
       line in the OS2 config.sys file has to be edited as follows:

                BASEDEV=IBM1S506.ADD /A:x /U:y /ATAPI

       The /A switch refers to the adapter number that the cdrom
       is attached to. The /U option references the unit or device
       number on a particular adapter. The /ATAPI parameter
       enables ATA Packet Interface protocol for the NEC 260. If the
       cdrom is attached to the second IDE port or adapter in a
       system and is the only device on the adapter you would
       enter:

                BASEDEV=IBM1S506.ADD /A:1 /U:0 /ATAPI
