TITLE: 950118 INSTALLED WARP AND LOST ACCESS TO (ATM) ADOBE TYPE
              MANAGER 3.0 FOR WINDOWS.

DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS:
    Installing WARP on a sysem with Adobe Type Manager 3.0 will
    'backlevel' to ATM ver. 2.5. You will also loose access to any
    imported fonts already on the system.

SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION:
    Depending on how WARP  is installed (bootmanager or dualboot)
        will determine how to modify the system.
        1. Dualboot
           Installation of WARP will replace the current ATM.INI in the
           WINDOWS subdirectory.
        2. Bootmanager
           Installation of WARP may point to the x:\psfonts subdirectory
           partition where it is installed and not to the path in the or
           in the ATM.INI file.

         .Setup.
         PFM_Dir=c:\psfonts\pfm
         PFB_Dir=c:\psfonts

         .Settings.
         ATM=On
         QLCDir=c:\psfonts
         Version=3.0
         TmpDir=c:\

DETAILS OF RESOLUTION:
    1. Dualboot

           a. Prior to installation of WARP
           Rename the current x:\windows\psfonts directory to
           x:\windows\tpsfonts.
           Rename or backup the current ATM.INI file.
           Reinstall Adobe Type Manager 2.5, 2.6, or 3.
           After installation, copy the contents of x:\windows\tpsfonts
           x:\windows\tpsfonts\pfm to the x:\windows\psfonts and
           x:\windows\psfonts\pfm directories

           b. After installation of WARP
           Rename the current x:\windows\psfonts directory to
           x:\windows\tpsfonts.
           Reinstall Adobe Type Manager 2.5, 2.6, or 3.0
           After installation, you can add the fonts from the the ATM co
           panel ADD feature choosing x:\windows\tpsfonts\pfm in the
           directories window.

        2. Bootmanager

           If Windows is on the same partition that WARP will be install
           follow proceedure 1a above. If WARP is installed on a differe
           partition, edit the ATM.INI file to mirror the appropriate li
           in .SETUP. and  .SETTINGS. example above, and reinstall ATM
           from disks.

        Note: Applications that are migrated will need the WIN_ATM  in t
        notebook set to on. It may also be necessary to reinstall specia
        fonts not included with ATM.
