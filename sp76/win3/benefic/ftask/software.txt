If you like this software you will maybe have a look on my other FREE
windows tools. 
You can find most of my FREE windows tools on public domain servers and also
on CompuServe, AOL and some BBS.
If you have internet access, you can always find the latest versions on
ftp.cica.indiana.edu and its mirror sites.
I only have internet access so it will took some time until the latest versions
of my programs will find their way to CompuServe, AOL or your BBS.
