                (c) 1993,94 by Andreas Furrer
=======================================================


This is version 1.24 of FTaskman.

FTaskman is a replacement for the taskmanager of Windows 3.1


FTaskman has the following additional functions to the normal taskmanager

- display the icons of all tasks (switchable)
- multiselection -> e.g. end several tasks
- show also invisible tasks (switchable)
- minimize other tasks when 'Switch to'
- new commands:
  + minimize selected tasks
  + minimize all tasks with the exception of the selected
  + minimize all tasks
  + start applications
  + terminate tasks abruptly
  + set tasks invisible or visible
  + set tasks stay on top or delete stay on top
  + tile windows horizontally or vertically
  + arrange only selected windows
  + exit, restart Windows or reboot the system

There is an english and a german version of FTaskman.
For the german version please read FTASKMAN.TXG.


Installation of FTaskman:
=========================

- To use the german version of FTaskman you have to rename FTASKMAN.EXG
  in FTASKMAN.EXE.
- Copy FTASKMAN.EXE in your windows directory (or any directory you want)
- Add the following line to the section [Boot] of the file SYSTEM.INI:

   TASKMAN.EXE=C:\WINDOWS\FTASKMAN.EXE
  
   (If you don't have copied FTASKMAN.EXE in the directory C:\WINDOWS
    change this path to the name of the directory in which you have copied
    FTASKMAN.EXE!)
- If you want to use the library CTL3D.DLL (see below), you have to copy the
  file CTL3D.DLL into the directory Windows\System.
  But don't override a newer version of CTL3D.DLL.

    ATTENTION: Use this command only if you can't close the task(s) with
               the 'End task' command!
    You can diable this command (see below).
- Windows ->
    shows a menu to exit Windows, restart Windows and reboot the system.
    You can diable this command (see below).
- Run
    show a dialog from where an application could be started.
    If you press the right mouse button in the edit field 'Command'
    you will see a list of the last used commands (if the history is enabled -
    see below) and you can select one of them.
    You can't specify parameters for the application!
    You can diable this command (see below).
- Options
    show options dialog
    You can diable this command (see below).
- About
    show version number and copyright information

Options dialog:

- Show icons in tasklist
- Default: show invisible
- Default: show full dialog
- Default: Arrange only selected tasks
- Minimize other tasks when 'Switch to'
    If you switch to one or more tasks with 'Switch to', all other tasks 
    will be minimized
- Close only after 'Switch to' and 'End Task'
    FTaskman will only close if you select 'Switch to', 'End Task' or 'Cancel'.
    With this option you can do some functions of FTaskman without starting
    FTaskman again after each operation.
- Save position on exit
    The position of FTaskman will be saved so the next time FTaskman will
    start at the same position
- Use pattern in dialog
    With this checkbox you can enable or disable the gray pattern around the
    dialogs.
- Number of commands in the history list of the 'Run' dialog
    If you press the right mouse button in the 'Command' edit field of the
    'Run' dialog you will see a history of previous used commands. The length
    of the history is controlled by the value of this filed. You can enter
    a value between 0 and 20. If you enter 0 the history function is disabled.
- Sort tasks
    Lets you choose if the tasklist will not be sorted, sorted alphabetically
    or will be sorted reverse alphabetically.
- Place invisible tasks
    You can place invisible tasks at the top or at the bottom of the tasklist
- Number of lines in task list
    The value of the two edits will control the number of lines you will see
    in the task list. You can enter a value between 1 and 30 for the listbox
    with icons and the listbox without icons. 
    Note: The number of lines of tasks is adjusted to the maximal size of
    your screen so the dialog can't get bigger as your screen.
    
You can also access most of the commands and options with a popup menu, 
if you press the right mouse button in the task listbox.


Invisible tasks will be marked with a '¤'.

The tasklist will not show tasks which have no title, because the standard
taskmanager also don't show them and there are a lot of untiteled windows 
which your system uses for internal things.


Disabling commands
==================
You can disable the commands Kill Task(s), Windows ->, Run and Options.
This is especially useful in multi-user environments.
To disable one of these commands you have to add the following lines
to the section [FTaskman] in your WIN.INI

NoKill=1                 ' disable 'Kill' Task(s)
NoClose=1                ' disable Windows ->
NoRun=1                  ' disable Run
NoOptions=1              ' disable Options


If you don't add one of the lines NoClose or NoRun and you have added one
of these lines to the [Restrictions] section of PROGMAN.INI to disable the
run command or the command to exit windows of the program manager,
the commands are also disabled in FTaskman.
But you can override these settings with NoClose=0 or NoRun=0 in the WIN.INI.


3D-dialogs
==========
FTaskman is using the CTL3D library from Microsoft to let the dialog controls
look 3 dimensional. If you don't like this look add

UseCtl3d=0

to the section [FTaskMan] in WIN.INI.



Freeware-Note
=============

You can use and distribute FTaskman free, as long as the following files are 
not changed and you distribute all files together

- ftaskman.exe
- ftaskman.exg
- ftaskman.txt
- ftaskman.txg

I am programming FTaskman for fun and not to make any profit. 
That's why FTaskman is free and you don't have to pay more or less high 
registration charges. I think it is a bad habit, that more and more program 
authors want to have money even for the smallest programs.

For informations about my other FREE Windows tools see the file
SOFTWARE.TXT (or the German version SOFTWARE.TXG).

Long live the Freeware!
