What is Windows Commander?

Windows Commander is a file manager for Windows  similar to the Windows file
manager WINFILE.EXE. But Windows Commander uses a different approach: it has two
fixed windows like a well-known file manager for DOS.

Here some key features of Windows Commander:

- Keyboard functions similar to the DOS original.
- Supports Drag & Drop with the mouse, including to the print manager.
- Extended copying, moving, renaming and deleting of entire trees 
  (Enables deleting "full" directories")
- Archives are handled like subdirectories. You can easily copy files
  to and from archives. The appropriate archiver program is automatically
  called. Pkzip, arj and lha are all supported.
- Start-menu (User-defined commands) to place your frequently used DOS and
  Windows programs into a drop down menu. The actual directory and/or the file
  under the cursor can be handed over to the application.
- Command line for the simple starting of programs with parameters, simply
  by typing the program name or by pressing CTRL+ENTER or CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER.
- Enhanced search function with full text search in any files across multiple
  drives
- Built in file viewer (F3) to view files of ANY SIZE in hex, binary or text
  format, using either the ASCII- (DOS) or the ANSI- (Windows) character set.
- Internal Unzip by Info-Zip, which allows unzipping without calling an
  external program! The source code in Turbo-Pascal is free and can be obtained
  directly from the author.

Removing Windows Commander: If you remove the program, also delete the files
wincmd.ini and noclose.pif in your Windows directory!

Installation BY HAND: Just copy the files to a directory on your hard disk.
Rename the files install.bin and installe.bin to install.zip and installe.zip
and unzip them with pkunzip. Then move all files with the extension .pif into
your Windows directory. Place the file ctl3dv2.dll in your windows\system 
directory. There must NOT be any copy of ctl3dv2.dll in any other directory
than the windows or system directory!!!
