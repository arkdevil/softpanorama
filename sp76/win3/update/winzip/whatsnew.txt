Internet File Format Support In WinZip 5.6:

The Internet is becoming more and more popular, and unlike
CompuServe and most other online services, not all parts of the
the Internet have standardized on the ZIP file format.  Many
Internet sites distribute files in "gzip" and Unix "compress"
format (files ending in GZ or Z) and use the old TAR (Tape
ARchive) format to group files.

WinZip 5.6 adds support for the TAR, gzip, and Unix compress
formats.  This means you can use WinZip to work with almost all
compressed files downloaded from the Internet.  WinZip 5.6 also
lets you decompress files in the "Microsoft Compress" format
(LZEXPAND) used on the Windows 3.x distribution disks and some
other Microsoft product distribution disks.  No external programs
are needed for these file formats.

Some notes on the new Internet file format support:

- WinZip does not let you create files in these formats, but other
  features (Extract, View, CheckOut) all work.

- Unlike ZIP, TAR, LZH, ARJ, and ARC files Microsoft-compressed
  files and Z files (gzip/compress) contain only ONE file.

- Unlike ZIP, LZH, ARJ, and ARC files, TAR files are NEVER
  compressed.

- Since TAR files are often distributed in Z format (with
  extensions like .TAZ and .TGZ) WinZip treats Z files containing
  a TAR file as a special case:  WinZip offers to decompress and
  open the TAR file.

- There is no reliable way to determine the uncompressed size of
  files in the gzip and compress format, so WinZip shows the size
  as a question mark.

Other Changes in WinZip 5.6:

- A new checkbox in the Configuration dialog box determines
  whether the right mouse button pops up a menu or selects listbox
  entries as in earlier versions.

- Conversion from long names to MS-DOS 8.3 filenames is smarter
  than in previous versions:  a name like XXX.YYY.TXT is now
  converted to XXXYYY.TXT rather than being truncated to XXX.YYY.
