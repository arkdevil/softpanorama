                           THE - The Hessling Editor
     
     OVERVIEW
     ========
     
     THE is a text editor that uses both command line commands and key bindings
     to operate. It is intended to be similar to the VM/CMS System Product 
     Editor, XEDIT and to Mansfield Software's, KEDIT.
     
     The screen display consists of several windows:
        - a main body window which displays the contents of the file being
          editted,
        - a command line from which commands may be issued,
        - an optional prefix window which shows line numbers and from
          which prefix commands can be issued
        - an id window which displays the file name, row/col etc. for the
          current file and
        - a status line which indicates global status info like number of files
          being editted, time etc.
     
     An important distinction must be made between what is called the current
     line and the focus line. The focus line is that line in the main body in
     which the cursor is displayed. All commands bound to function keys use the
     focus line as the initial line from which to begin executing the command.
     Commands issued from the command line use the current line as the starting
     line for execution of commands. The current line is the line in the main
     body that is highlighted; by default line 7.
     
     To move between the command line and the main body the 'tabcmd' command is
     used. By default it is bound to the Home key (on PCs), the Do key
     (on vt220s) and F12 (on xterms). If you prefer the XEDIT feel for arrow
     keys, issue the 'set CMDArrow TAB TAB TAB' command from the command line.
     
     To determine what keys are bound to what commands, type 'show' followed 
     by Return on the command line, then follow the directions displayed.
     Key bindings may be changed for the current session by using the 'define'
     command.
     
     PROFILE FILE
     ============
     
     Various session defaults may be changed on startup for an individual by
     using a profile file. This file contains various commands that set the
     current environment, including key bindings. This profile file can also be
     used to process commands in batch mode. For example, to change all
     occurrences of 'alligator' to 'crocodile' in the file file.ext in batch
     mode, a profile file (prf.prf) with the following commands would be used:
     
          'c/alligator/crocodile/ * *'
          'file'
     
     and the command
     
          the -p prf.prf file.ext
     
     would be issued.
     
     This changes the first string enclosed in delimiters (either /,\ or @) to
     the second string for every line (*) starting at the current line
     (0 initially) changing each occurrence on a line (*).
     Maybe you only want to change a string after the first line that contains
     the string 'donkey', but only change the second occurrence of that string.
     The profile commands would then be:
     
          '/donkey/'
          'c/alligator/crocodile/ * 1 2'
          'file'
     
     The change command uses a 'target' specification as its first parameter
     after the string details. A target can be a number of lines, an absolute
     line number or a string.
     Number of line targets consist of either a positive integer, for
     referencing lines toward the end of the file, negative for referencing
     toward the start of the file or '*', which is all the remaining lines in
     the file or '-*' which is all lines toward the start of the file.
     An absolute line number in the form of ':n' is the line number in a file,
     starting with line number 1.
     A target is any string within the allowable target delimiters.
     
     For more information on default key bindings see the *.hlp files. Detailed
     documentation of each command is present in each of the comm*.c files.

     DESCRIPTION
          The DEFINE command allows the user to assign one or many 
          commands and optional parameter(s) to a key. 
     
          Commands may be abbreviated.
     
          If multiple commands are assigned, then the LINEND setting
          must be ON and the LINEND character must match the character
          that delimits the commands at the time that the DEFINE command
          is executed and at the time the key is pressed.
     
          With no arguments, any existing definition for that key is
          removed and the key reverts back to its default assignation (if
          it had any).

          line of the window and CMDARROWS ... SCROLL is set (the default),
          otherwise the cursor returns to the command line.
     
          When on the command line, this command moves forward through the
          list of previous command line commands if CMDARROWS RETRIEVE ...
          is set or tabs to the first line of the main window if

                                       [Respect|Ignore]
     
     DESCRIPTION
          The CASE command sets the editor's handling of the case of text.
     
          The first option (which is mandatory) controls how text is entered
          by the user. When LOWER or UPPER are in effect, the shift or caps
          lock keys have no effect on the text being entered. When MIXED is
          in effect, text is entered in the case set by the use of the shift
          and caps lock keys.
     
          The second option determines how the editor determines if a string
          target matches text in the file when the target is used in a LOCATE
          command.  With IGNORE in effect, a match is
          found irrespective of the case of the target or the found text.
          The following strings are treated as equivalent: the THE The ThE...
          With RESPECT in effect, the target and text must be the same case.
          Therefore a target of 'The' only matches text containing 'The', not
          'THE' or 'ThE' etc.
     
          The third option determines how the editor determines if a string
          target matches text in the file when the target is used in a CHANGE
          command.  With IGNORE in effect, a match is
          found irrespective of the case of the target or the found text.
          The following strings are treated as equivalent: the THE The ThE...
          With RESPECT in effect, the target and text must be the same case.
          Therefore a target of 'The' only matches text containing 'The', not
          'THE' or 'ThE' etc.
     
          The fourth option determines how the editor determines the sort 
          order of upper and lower case with the SORT command.
          With IGNORE in effect, upper and lower case letters are treated as
          equivalent.
          With RESPECT in effect, upper and lower case letters are treated as
          different values and uppercase characters will sort before lowercase
          characters.

          arrows keys are hit.
     
          CMDARROWS RETRIEVE SCROLL SCROLL (the default) will set the up and 
          down arrows to retrieve the last or next command entered on the command 
          line and to scroll the screen when at the top or bottom of the main
          text window. The left and right arrows will cause the main text window 
          to scroll if appropriate.
     
          CMDARROWS TAB TAB TAB will set the up and down arrows to move to the

                     middle line number, a negative subtracts from it.
                     eg. M+3 on a 24 line screen will be line 15
                         M-5 on a 24 line screen will be line 7
     
          [+|-]n   - this sets the current line to be relative to the
                     top of the screen (if positive or no sign) or
                     relative to the bottom of the screen if negative.
                     eg. +3 or 3 will set current line to line 3
                         -3 on a 24 line screen will be line 21
     
          If the resulting line is outside the bounds of the screen
          the position of the current line will become the middle line
          on the screen.

          should be displayed at.
          The second form, turns the display of the prefix area off.
          Executed from within the profile, the only effect is that the
          defaults for all files is changed.
          Executed from the command line, the PREFIX command changes the
          current window displays to reflect the required options.
     
          The third form of the PREFIX command allows the users to specify
          a synonym for a prefix command or REXX prefix macro. The 'newname' 
          is the command entered in the prefix area and 'oldname' corresponds 
          to an existing prefix command or a REXX macro file in the MACROPATH 
          ending in .the or whatever the value of MACROEXT is at the time the

     ========================================================================
     APPENDIX 1 - ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
     ========================================================================
     
     THE uses the following environment variables:
     
             THE_HOME_DIR     - the directory in which THE looks for its help
                                file(s) and macro(s);
             THE_HELP_FILE    - the fully qualified file name containing help
                                information.
             THE_PROFILE_FILE - the fully qualified file name for the default
                                profile file.
             THE_MACRO_PATH   - a list of all directories in which THE is to 
                                look for macro files.
     
     The following defines how these environment variables are used under UNIX.
     
     If no environment variable; THE_HOME_DIR, is set prior to starting THE,
     THE uses /usr/local/THE/ (or /opt/THE/ if SYSVR4 is defined when compiling)
     as the default value for ${THE_HOME_DIR}. 
     This can be changed in the.c if necessary.
     
     The default value of THE_HELP_FILE is ${THE_HOME_DIR}${TERM}.hlp
     eg. with no environment variables set and $TERM set to vt220, the help 
     file to be looked for will be /usr/local/THE/vt220.hlp (or 
     /opt/THE/vt220.hlp if SYSVR4 is defined when compiling).
     If THE_HOME_DIR environment variable was set to /usr/opt/etc or changed in
     the.c, the help file will be /usr/opt/etc/vt220.hlp. If no $TERM 
     environment variable is set, "default" is used.
     
     The name of the default profile file is $HOME/.therc.
     
     The default value of THE_MACRO_PATH is ${THE_HOME_DIR}:. THE will look for 
     a macro file first in ${THE_HOME_DIR} and then in the current directory. 
     So with no environment variables set, THE looks for macros in 
     $(THE_HOME_DIR} first and if no file exists in that directory, THE will 
     look in the current directory. If the file does not exist in either of 
     these places, an error message will be displayed.
     The format of THE_MACRO_PATH is dir1:dir2:dir3 Each directory is seperated 
     by colons. By default, up to 20 directories may be specified. This can be 
     changed in the.h.
     
     The following defines how these environment variables are used under DOS 
     and OS/2.
     
     By default THE_HOME_DIR is set to the directory from which THE was 
     invoked. Assuming THE.EXE resides in d:\tools, THE_HOME_DIR will equate 
     to d:\tools\.
     
     The default value of THE_HELP_FILE is ${THE_HOME_DIR}dos.hlp for DOS and
     ${THE_HOME_DIR}os2.hlp for OS/2.
     
     The name of the default profile file is ${THE_HOME_DIR}profile.the.
     
     The default value of THE_MACRO_PATH is ${THE_HOME_DIR};. THE will look for
     a macro file first in THE_HOME_DIR and then in the current directory. So 
     with no environment variables set, THE first looks for macros in the 
     directory from which THE was invoked and then in the current directory. 
     If the file does not exist in either directory, an error message is displayed.
     The format of THE_MACRO_PATH is dir1;dir2;dir3 Each directory is seperated 
     by semi-colons. By default up to 20 directories may be specified. This can 
     be changed in the.h.
