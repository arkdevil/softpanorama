QView is a tiny spreadsheet viewer, focused primarily on Quattro .WQ1
files. But with some restrictions it handles also other Quattro (as
.WKQ, .WQ2 or .WB1), Lotus (.WKS, .WK1) or Symphony (.WRK, .WR1) files.
QView is designed to be used with Norton Commander, although use with
another "shell" or as a stand alone viewer is possible as well.

QView is AS IS. If you want to, you can REGISTER it (see READ.ME file)
and use it on your own risk. The author is not responsible for ANY DAMAGES
caused by this software.


Usage:
======

QView expects spreadsheet file name as a parameter. For example:

     QVIEW SAMPLE.WQ1

File SAMPLE.WQ1 is displayed in the form similar to your original spreadsheet
(but you don't have to wait for so long).
You can browse through the sheet using the standard keys:

<left arrow>  or <Ctrl-S>          cell left
<right arrow> or <Ctrl-D>          cell right
<down arrow>  or <Ctrl-X>          cell down
<up arrow>    or <Ctrl-E>          cell up

<PgUp> or <Ctrl-R>                 page up
<PgDn> or <Ctrl-C>                 page down
<Tab>  or  <Ctrl-right arrow>      page right
<Shift-Tab> or <Ctrl-left arrow>   page left

<Home>                             go to the top of the file
<End>                              go to the end of the data

Quattro Pro 5.0 uses notebooks with up to 256 sheets (files .WQ2, .WB1).
You can browse through the sheets:

<Ctrl-PgDn>                             next sheet
<Ctrl-PgUp>                             previous sheet

You can go directly to the specified cell:
------------------------------------------
<F5>                                    go to the cell address
<F7>                                    search the cell with given content
<Shift-F7>                              repeat last search

<F5> :  you specify the address of the cell you want to see.
        The address is in the form COLUMN ROW (or ROW COLUMN).
        If you enter just one coordinate (ROW or COLUMN), the other
        remains unchanged.

        Examples:

        "AB6"  is equivalent to "6AB"
        "B" moves the cursor to the column "B", in the current row

        If you view the notebook with several sheets (files .WQ2, .WB1),
        you can specify the sheet number. The sheet specification
        (ending with colon ":") must start the address.

        Examples:

        "A:"      go to the first sheet
        "C:A"     go to the third sheet, column "A"
        "B:BC76"  go to the sheet "B:", column "BC", row 76


<F7> :  you specify string you want to search. The search is not
        case sensitive. If you want to repeat the search,
        press <Shift-F7>


Others:
-------
<F1>                    Help
<F10> or <Esc>          Quit


Restrictions:
=============
QView was designed to be tiny and fast. I think, it is. But some
restrictions are the price.
QView displays correctly the majority of the cell formats used in .WQ1
files, including fixed/scientific notation, dates, time, column width,
etc. Lines are not displayed. Files .WQ2 and .WB1 are displayed in
general form, i.e. no format specifications are recognized.
