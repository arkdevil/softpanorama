INSTALL.TXT Installation for SUBDOC version 2.10
------------------------------------------------
1   Copy SDOC210.EXE into your VB working directory (eg C:\VB)
1.1 Unzip the package with the command SDOC210.EXE
1.2 Move SUBDOC.HLP into \WINDOWS (or your windows directory)
1.3 IF (AND ONLY IF!) IT IS NOT ALREADY PRESENT THEN:-
		Move CMDIALOG.VBX to \WINDOWS\SYSTEM

2   Add SUBDOC.EXE to whatever group you have your VB tools in.

3   Note: You need the VB3 runtime library VBRUN300.DLL.
 
4   Away you go!  
	A good idea is to configure screen and printer before getting
	to serious work.  Look at the "help" - "overview" for what SUBDOC
	expects from you.

5   A sample application SDSAMPLE.MAK/FRM/BAS is included.  Try this
	first.  (It is formatted in ASCII which is essential.)  You do not
	HAVE to load this into the VB workbench, although if you do you can
	see how simple it is to document reusable code.
