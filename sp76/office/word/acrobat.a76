Do I detect the SGML evangelists in full cry in the current crop of posts?
From what I've seen SGML requires a fair amount of up-front work to set up
a document. This (costly) work is justified if you want to re-use a
document in different formats - although you might need several re-uses to
justify the effort. 
Using the PDFWriter I can go from an (existing) Word document, link from
its (existing) table of contents to the relevant pages, creating bookmarks
en route, and link to a couple of other documents, ending up with a
multi-platform linked file, in literally a few minutes. 
I'm not claiming that the current implementation of Acrobat is all I'd
wish for, but it provides a quick cost-effective means of getting
documents on-line.

Horses for courses?

I'm not going to follow-up on the related threads, but the sniffy comments
I've seen seem to suggest that SGML 'purists' are joyously latching on to
badly prepared documents as an excuse to bash Acrobat.

Hmm... my impression is the exact opposite.

It's good news for HTML; widespread acceptance
of PDF may relieve some of the pressure to turn HTML
into a page formatting language and leave it room
to evolve in a direction consistent with its original
goal as a simple, platform-independant, content-based 
hypertext markup language.  When Joe Homepage asks
"How do I make my text show up in 11pt Gorgonzola Italic
and wrap it around this triangle-shaped bitmapped graphic?"
the HTML community will be able to say "Use PDF!"
and there will be less temptation to invent a 
<TRIANGLE-SHAPED-BITMAP> element.

On the other hand, it's bad news for SGML as a whole.
HTML, for all its flaws, has dramatically increased
SGML's visibility among the thousands eager to jump
onto "this new Information SuperHighway thing".   A
few -- not many, but a few -- have even caught on to
the idea of generic markup, and *like* it.  If PDF really
takes off, there is a great danger that HTML will simply
be ignored; established webheads will tell newcomers
"Oh, don't bother with that, it's worthless; it can't
even wrap text around triangle-shaped bitmaps!"  And 
as long as their documents Look Good Under Netscape (tm),
they'll never know what they're missing.
