<H2>Q-HTML - Quick HTML (or &quot;Cue HTML!&quot;)</H2>

<P>
Q-HTML (c). Current Version V1.10<BR>
</P><P>
Q-HTML is an advanced tool to convert text into HTML quickly and easily.
</P><P>
The program is a mere 29K (help fight bloatware) and it performs the
following operations:<BR>
</P><P>
Q-HTML converts all http:, gopher:, ftp: etc references into properly
formatted working WWW links and  news: references into followable
newsgroup references. Q-HTML also converts all mail addresses into
followable mailto e-mail references. Paragraph markers are inserted
between paragraphs and line break markers are inserted where Q-HTML
encounters apparantly pre-formatted text. There are 3 algorithms for
this, and is more complex than just looking at the line length.
</P><P>
Any underlined text is converted into headers (level 2 or level 3 as
appropriate). Special characters are also translated to ensure
compliance to HTML standards.<BR>
</P><P>
The program can also handle structured files like FAQs, splitting them
into smaller files for the WWW and crossindexing them automatically.
This allows one version for both text and HTML to be maintained and the
HTML to be generated automatically.<BR>
</P><P>
As well as working with &quot;plain&quot; text, the program also handles text with
embedded &lt;URL: ...&gt; markers. You can also process multiple files in one
sweep. Q-HTML also adds a title, header and body markers and date/time
stamped footers to the text. This produces a WWW page which will work
instantly and save you a lot of time and effort.<BR>
</P><P>
I originally wrote the program to convert the soc.culture.scottish
FAQ at <A HREF="http://www.scot.demon.co.uk/scotfaq.html">http://www.scot.demon.co.uk/scotfaq.html</A> quickly into HTML.
Q-HTML has allowed me to convert this one 320K+ file into 150+ HTML
pages automatically in seconds and has saved me from hours of tedious
and repetitive editing. I have put the HTML version of the FAQ,
automatically sectioned and indexed by Q-HTML, at<BR>

<H2>User Comments</H2>

Here's what some users have said about the product:<BR>
</P><P>
I just wanted to drop you a note to say thanks for making such an
excellent utility available. Q-HTML has given me the opportunity to
scrap that horrendously useless plug-in called Internet Assistant for
Word that I've been trying to use to auto-convert huge documents to
html. (Ewan McDonell &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ewan@digitality.com">ewan@digitality.com</A>&gt;)<BR>
</P><P>
When I first read your post I thought you were re-inventing the wheel,
but I think you've come up with the pneumatic tyre. Well done!
I tried it succesfully with a 792 kB text file under Win 95.
</P><P>
Many thanks Craig - a really nifty piece of software.<BR>
</P><P>
Downloaded Q-HTML the other day, and I have to admit it's the best
utility I've seen to convert text files to HTML. It's fast (even under
16-bit Windows) and the resulting pages require little or no editing.
It's saved me a lot of time converting a number of articles to HTML for
later posting at my Web page.<BR>

Q-HTML is also distributed as part of N.A.C.H.O.S., &quot;The HTML editor that
doesn't suck&quot;. This editor got &quot;5 cows&quot; from the Tucows software archive.

<H2>Calling the program</H2>

</P><P>
If you run the program and don't give it any parameters, the user
interface will appear. The user interface supports three algorithms for
dealing with newlines in the source document and also allows many files
to be selected for conversion.<BR>
</P><P>
Alternatively, the program can be run in command line only mode,
this is especially useful if you are running the program from a script
to convert many files automatically.<BR>
</P><P>
To run Q-HTML in command line mode from the DOS prompt (Win95 or NT) or
the &quot;run&quot; line in 16 bit windows (Program or File manager), just enter
q-html inputfilename outputfilename pagetitle<BR>
</P><P>
e.g. c:\q-html myfile.txt myfile.htm &quot;Q-HTML homepage&quot;
</P><P>
If the output file name is omitted it defaults to c:\output.htm
If you miss off the output file name then don't specify a title!!
</P><P>

<H2>Optional file sectioning</H2>

If you have a large FAQ or similar document which you want broken into
seperate files and indexed, then please note the following:<BR>
</P><P>
You need to already have an index in plain text at the start of your
document, the section headers must have numbers enclosed in square
brackets, and within the main body of the FAQ any such number at the
start of a line is taken to be a section header. Numbers in the middle of
lines (e.g. see section [2.5]) are converted to working links. To use
this functionality within Q-HTML, use the following command line syntax:
</P><P>
q-html yourinputfilename FAQ &quot;optional FAQ title here&quot;
</P><P>
The &quot;output filename&quot; FAQ indicates to Q-HTML to perform sectioning and
cross-indexing processing.<BR>
</P><P>
From the user interface, just click the &quot;Split and cross reference output&quot;
checkbox to use this functionality.<BR>
</P><P>
The files generated are as follows:<BR>
contents.html<BR>
a_b.html where [a.b] is the name of a section in the original document.
Sections can be in various forms ([4], [4.1], [4.2.3]) etc.<BR>
THESE FILES WILL BE DELETED IF THEY ALREADY EXIST<BR>

Note this is the actual executable, not a zipfile.<BR>
</P><P>
The software is written in Visual Basic, and has both a screen based
interface and a command line only interface. The command line only
interface will run from the DOS prompt in both Windows NT and Windows 95.
The program also runs under 16 bit windows but the DOS window under
16 bit windows doesn't allow the same command line features, so you'll
need to execute the command from the run option in program manager or
file manager, or set up an icon with the parameters.<BR>
You'll need a copy of vbrun300.dll in your c:\windows\system (or
equivalent) directory and cmdialog.vbx<BR>
</P><P>
I've also put<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.scot.demon.co.uk/vbrun300.dll">http://www.scot.demon.co.uk/vbrun300.dll</A> and<BR>

on that site too incase you need them.<BR>
