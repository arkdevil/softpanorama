[1] What is Q-HTML?
===================

Q-HTML (c) is an advanced tool to convert text into HTML quickly and 
easily.  It runs on both 16 and 32 bit MS Windows platforms and performs
the following operations:

Q-HTML converts all http:, gopher:, ftp: etc references into properly 
formatted working WWW links and news: references into followable 
newsgroup references. Q-HTML also converts all mail addresses into 
followable mailto e-mail references. Paragraph markers are inserted 
between paragraphs and line break markers are inserted where Q-HTML 
encounters apparantly pre-formatted text. There are 3 algorithms for 
this, and is more complex than just looking at the line length. 

Any underlined text is converted into headers (level 2 or level 3 as 
appropriate). Special characters are also translated to ensure 
compliance to HTML standards.

The program can also handle structured files like FAQs, splitting them 
into smaller files for the WWW and crossindexing them automatically. 
This allows one version for both text and HTML to be maintained and the 
HTML to be generated automatically. Try that functionality out on this
file and you will have a "contents.html" with working links to the
different sections of this document - these sections will all be 
in different .html files. It is best to copy this file to a new
temporary directory before using this functionality as the program
will delete any contents.html, 1.html, .... 7.html files to 
perform this functionality.

As well as working with "plain" text, the program also handles text with 
embedded <URL: ...> markers. You can also process multiple files in one 
sweep by selecting them in the input file dialog. The Shareware version
of Q-HTML will only process 3 files maximum in one sweep. The registered
version of the program does not have this restriction.

Q-HTML also adds a title, header and body markers and date/time 
stamped footers to the text. This produces a WWW page which will work 
instantly and save you a lot of time and effort.

For further instructions on using the program, please view the file 
q-html.txt (text file)
q-html.html (view this in your WWW browser)
The html file was generated from the text file by Q-HTML.


[2] How to install Q-HTML
=========================

Simply extract the file q-html.exe from the zip file and copy it to any
suitable directory on your hard-drive.

The program requires two additional files which are not supplied in this
saveset but which are very probably already on your system. It is usual
to not include these files in software archives so that the archive 
maintainer only has to maintain one copy of these common files,
rather than one per tool.  The two files are
vbrun300.dll (the standard Visual Basic 3 run time library)
cmdialog.vbx (the windows "Common Dialog" vbx). 
These files should be copied to your c:\windows\system
directory, or equivalent.

If you receive an error when running Q-HTML that one of these files 
is missing, you can download them from the WWW on
http://www.scot.demon.co.uk/vbrun300.dll and
http://www.scot.demon.co.uk/cmdialog.vbx 
or most large software archive sites.


[3] Program's status
====================

Q-HTML is shareware. Copying the tool is encouraged. The program
will continue working indefinitely but will nag you after a while
if you haven't registered. In addition, the program will only process
the first 1000 lines of a file after 31-July-97. As WWW pages are
nearly always much smaller than this, it is not likely to cause a
problem but is an incentive to register.

To register your copy of Q-HTML, please visit the tool's
homepage at
http://www.scot.demon.co.uk/q-html.html
Where there is a link to the registration page. On the registration page, 
you can pay for your copy via credit card and a secure transaction.
There are discounts available for multiple orders.

On registration, you will get a registered version of the program 
e-mailed to you as soon as possible.

[7] Known problems and restrictions
====================================

This program was developed under Windows 95 using Visual Basic 3.
Visual Basic 3 does not support long filenames, but as long filenames
are becoming more popular, they have been encoded into the program.
If you are using 32 bit windows and you are looking for an .html file,
but it doesn't appear to be there, try looking for the same file
with an .htm extension. Then rename it to be .html. After that, the
program will update the correct file. Despite VB3's lack of support
for long filenames, once the file has been created with a long filename,
VB3 can access it normally using the 8.3 version of the name.
