This guide provides a comprehensive look at the new enhancements in Netscape
Communicator Standard and Professional Editions.  Netscape Communicator was designed to
create new standards for open email, groupware, and browsing software. This guide is
organized to help you understand what product components and features assist users to:
<UL>

<LI> better leverage their software with tight integration between

components and legacy data and proven ease of use;

<LI> work smarter and faster;

<LI> communicate with anyone; and

<LI> reduce cost of ownership in the enterprise.

Netscape Communicator is a single product providing a complete set of tools that users
need for effective everyday communication.  It is comprised of eight tightly integrated
components that provide the communication, information creation, and data access
infrastructure used when accessing Communicator.  These components are not sold
separately by Netscape as separate applications; rather, together they provide a rich
set of services optimized for today's business and Web users.  They include:

<UL> <LI> <A HREF="#navigator">Netscape Navigator</A> <LI> <A HREF="#messenger">Netscape
Messenger</A> <LI> <A HREF="#collabra">Netscape Collabra</A> <LI> <A

</UL>



<P> How does the integration work across these components?  Click on a hyperlink and
Netscape Navigator's browsing engine takes you there - whether to a Web document or to a
discussion group posting.  Compose an email message, discussion group posting, or an
HTML document, and Netscape Composer provides the authoring engine.  Select a name in
the Personal Address Book, and you can send  email, post a discussion group message, or
initiate an Internet phone call - all from within the same interface.  Any way a user
wants to structure their everyday work and communication, Communicator provides the
right combination of components and functionality to get it done quickly and easily.

In addition to the larger trends shaping the industry, a lot of customer research also
shaped the enhancements in Netscape Communicator. This research included:

<UL> <LI> hundreds of on-site customer visits; <LI> more than a year of ongoing
usability testing of every aspect of Communicator and its components; <LI> extensive
focus group testing; and <LI> feedback from the largest series of public betas in
software history. </UL>


<P> Equally important as new  customer research was having the in-house expertise to
understand and meet the challenges of developing a product like Communicator. 
Netscape's acquisition of Collabra in the fall of 1995 added a team of experts who
brought a body of groupware and messaging knowledge to the collective brainpower of the
already successful Navigator engineering team.  Their intimate understanding of this
market and these customers did much to influence the direction of the messaging and
discussion group technology that's now an integral part of Communicator.  The spring
1996 acquisition of InSoft introduced experts in the real-time collaboration field to
the Communicator team.  Already familiar with customer needs in this increasingly
important area, they moved quickly to integrate their findings with the rest of the
team.  Finally, the recent addition of the CS&T calendaring team rounded out the
Communicator group's knowledge of customer needs and challenges in the group calendaring
and scheduling arena, particularly at the enterprise level.


<P>


With all this behind it, it's easy to see why Netscape Communicator offers customers  a
huge step forward, regardless of what they're trying to do or how they're trying to
communicate.

<B>Communicator taskbar.</B>  In previous versions of Navigator, users accessed
different functions through various menu commands. If users took advantage of this
functionality often, they looked for easier, more apparent ways to access it quickly. 
The taskbar gives users quick and consistent access to the most commonly used
functionality in Communicator.  It can be used either as a floating palette or "docked"
into the lower right corner.  Users can also move between the two states by clicking the
"N" or simply dragging and docking it. The taskbar is functionally oriented rather than
component-specific because our usability studies showed that users interact with the
software on a per-task basis ("I want to edit a file"), not on a component basis ("I
want to use Composer"). Which component is used to accomplish a task is seamless to the
user. </UL> <P>

<UL> <LI><B>Keyboard navigation.</B>  Many users prefer to use keyboard navigation
either because they find it faster or they are unable to use a pointing device.  Users
can now easily move between various parts of Navigator using only the keyboard (Tab,
Enter, Shift, Control, Home, End, Page Up/Down, and the arrow keys).  The current
selection is indicated visually by a thin line around the selected item. <P>

<LI><B>More intuitive preferences.</B> Rigorous usability testing showed that unifying
preference access in one  menu item (Edit/Preferences) dramatically improved its
usability.

<P>

<LI><B>NetHelp.</B>  Netscape released a Software Development Kit (SDK) for HTML-based
NetHelp earlier this year.  Netscape Communicator uses NetHelp, replacing native help
for each platform of Netscape Navigator 3.0 and earlier.  NetHelp documentation consists
of HTML pages. Thus, the help is easily modifiable by enterprises or ISPs using any tool
that can create HTML (including Composer).  Navigator 4.0's NetHelp is also
context-sensitive, so clicking a Help button brings users to an appropriate place in the
Help documentation, making it easy to find help without having to comb through
hierarchical folders. <P>

<LI><B>Multiuser profiles.</B>  Prior to Communicator, users wishing to have multiple
settings (such as for home or work or for multiple coworkers or family members sharing
the same machine) had to manually change each preference. Communicator now supports
multiple profiles, in which each user selects a profile at startup (in a dialog box),
and Navigator displays and uses the appropriate bookmarks and  Communicator preferences,
such as mail server information.

<P>

<LI><B>Modular install.</B>  With modular install, users will have more flexibility and
choice in what components, plug-ins, or helper applications, they install. </UL>

<LI><B>Java improvements.</B><P>

<UL> <LI>Java runtime performance is improved with the inclusion of the Symantec JIT
compiler for Windows 95 and NT and Macintosh, and numerous other runtime improvements.
The result is that Java applets load and run faster.  <P> 
<LI>Support for the new JavaSoft JDK 1.1.2 includes JAR files, Object
Serialization, internationalization, RMI, inner classes, reflection, I/O and networking
enhancements, and AWT imaging improvements. 
</UL><P> 
<LI><B>Performance Improvements.</B>
Memory usage has been greatly reduced on the Macintosh platform, providing for improved
performance and reduced system requirements.  Navigator, Messenger, Collabra, and
Composer all run in a 6MB partition.
 <P> 
 <LI> <B>Internet Foundation Classes (IFC).
</B>Built-in Java classes allow for serious enterprise Java and JavaScript application
development. Classes are included for Java User Interface creation and access to open
Internet standards protocols such as SMTP, IMAP4, POP3, LDAP, and SOIF/RDM.</LI>

<P> <LI><B>Internet Inter-ORB Protocol.</B>  Inclusion of an ORB allows Communicator to
talk to any CORBA-compliant networked object, an important addition for enterprises
wishing to access both legacy data and custom network applications.

<P> Netscape Navigator is the premier Internet and intranet browser.  Based on HTTP and

of information and network applications available on the World Wide Web, FTP sites, and
more. <P>

The Netscape Navigator user interface, used by millions of customers, has been updated
and revised - based on hundreds of customer visits and usability tests - to help users
more intelligently navigate through it as well as the Web or corporate intranet.  (Note
that some of the UI featured here is not yet final.)

<P>


<B> N<FONT SIZE=-1>EW,</FONT> S<FONT SIZE=-1>MARTER</FONT> I<FONT
SIZE=-1>NTERFACE</FONT></B><BR> Netscape Navigator 4.0, along with all of Netscape
Communicator, features an updated, streamlined user interface that includes the removal
of some of the less-used or unnecessary buttons (such as Open), all new icons, a
customizable button bar, revised menu items,  and more.

<UL> <P> <LI><B>New toolbars.</B>  The toolbars in Navigator 4.0 have been redesigned
for greatly increased flexibility.

<UL> <P> <LI><B>Open/close tabs.</B>  Clicking on these tabs opens or closes a toolbar
from view, more easily freeing up space for content. <P> </UL> <CENTER><IMG
SRC="/comprod/products/communicator/images/2.gif" WIDTH=270 HEIGHT=97></CENTER> <UL> <P>
<LI><B>Custom toolbar.</B>  This new toolbar provides immediate access to important
sites. By dragging the page icon to the custom toolbar or by selecting Customize
Toolbars in the View menu, users can add buttons and customize their icons on this
toolbar; clicking the icon takes users directly to that page. </UL> <P><CENTER><IMG
SRC="/comprod/products/communicator/images/3.gif" WIDTH=271 HEIGHT=85></CENTER><P> <UL>
<LI><B>Smaller toolbars.</B>  Toolbars now take up less screen space, leaving more room
for content.

</UL>

<P>

<LI><B>New Back and Forward buttons.</B>  In the past, there was no way of knowing
exactly where the Back or Forward buttons would take you.  In Navigator 4.0, the tooltip
that appears when mousing over the button gives the title of the page it will go to.
Clicking and holding on the button gives a longer list of pages (going backward and
forward, appropriately), from which the user can select and go directly to that page
without hitting Back or Forward repeatedly.

<P> <CENTER> <IMG SRC="/comprod/products/communicator/images/4.gif" WIDTH=274
HEIGHT=102> </CENTER> <P>

<LI><B>Smart Images button.</B>  Many users always set Navigator to Autoload images so
that they never need to use the Images button.  Navigator 4.0 now only shows this button
when Autoload Images is off.

<P>

<LI><B>New Search button.</B>  Nearly all users expected the Find button in prior
versions of Navigator to find something on the Web rather than simply on the current
page.  In Navigator 4.0, it has been replaced with the Search button, which brings up
the general search page that lets users search on the Web using any of the major search
engines. <P>

<LI><B>New Guide button.</B> The Guide button takes users to a well-organized, helpful
list of links created by Yahoo.

<P> <LI><B>More screen real estate.</B> The row of buttons under the location bar was
rarely used and took up valuable screen space.  With their removal, a greater portion of
the screen is available for the content window, a much requested addition from Web
designers.

<UL>

<LI><B>New Bookmark Quickfile.</B> Usability testing showed that while bookmarks were
used extensively by most users, many found it difficult to keep their bookmarks well
organized. The new Quickfile button, found on the location bar, allows for easy access
to and filing of bookmarks. Users can simply drag the page icon to the Quickfile button,
where they can place it directly into a folder. This  lets users organize their
bookmarks as they create them. Advanced editing is accessible immediately from the same
Quickfile menu.

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="/comprod/products/communicator/images/5.gif" WIDTH=455
HEIGHT=225></CENTER><P>

<LI><B>Improved context-sensitive menus.</B> Pop-down context menus provide a way for
users to access functions related to particular parts of a page.  These helpful menus
provide quick access to functions within the context of a page, with a right
mouse-button click on Windows and Unix platforms or by holding down the mouse button on
the Macintosh.  New functionality includes:

<UL> <P> <LI><B>Stop animations and applets.</B>  This new addition gives users more
control over their system resources and is particularly helpful for lower-performance
systems.

<LI><B>Smarter frame page management.</B>  This new menu item lets users place the
contents of a single frame - which normally resides within a frameset - into a new
browser window containing just the contents of that single frame.  This is a great
addition for those wishing to bookmark just the content inside the frame, not the entire
frameset.

<LI><B> AutoComplete in location field.</B> Many users type the same URL repeatedly  into
Navigator's location field.  AutoComplete makes browsing faster by intelligently
finishing a URL that a user is typing in by matching it with URLs previously visited.

<LI><B>Improved tooltips.</B>  Tooltips that appear under buttons are now simpler and
more descriptive.

A large part of building a browser that makes users more efficient is about creative
solutions to Web limitations for designers; a better, smarter platform that developers
can build on; and more intelligence built into the product, so users' experience with
additional product functionality is secure and seamless.




<UL>

<LI> <B>Dynamic HTML. </B>Dynamic HTML transforms static content into interactive
applications and provides key benefits to users and content developers. Dynamic HTML is
based on technologies developed in conjunction with the W3C, including combinations of
HTML, style sheets (including CSS1 and HTML positioning and layering) and JavaScript
(including a greatly enhanced HTML object model). Together these technologies support
richer, more dynamic content without requiring additional trips to the server. 
<P> 
<UL>
<LI><B>HTML positioning and layering.</B> HTML designers can now place HTML content
(including text, images, and applets) exactly where they wish on a page by simply
specifying the top left corner where that HTML should be placed. Designers can also
easily overlap images, text, etc., and can exactly specify their z-order (that is, which
blocks of HTML go above or below other blocks). In addition, this HTML can be easily
manipulated on the page using JavaScript. Based on a W3C working draft co-authored by
Netscape developers, HTML positioning and layering helps form a powerful foundation for
compelling, animated content - all within universally supported HTML pages.

<P>

<CENTER> <IMG SRC="/comprod/products/communicator/images/6.gif" WIDTH=410 HEIGHT=300>
</CENTER>

<P> <LI><B>Dynamic style sheets.</B> In the past, Web page designers who wished to adjust
such aspects of page design as colors and text sizes had to write HTML tags for each
element.  With style sheets however, designers not only get complete control over these
elements, they can also build a style sheet standard that they can leverage repeatedly. 
(In concept, they are similar to templates.)  For example, a corporate document style can
be created so all pages share the same corporate look.  Navigator 4.0 fully supports
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS1), a W3C recommendation.  In addition, with dynamic styles,
these style sheet properties are accessible via JavaScript and can be set and programmed
using JavaScript.  For example, using dynamic styles, designers can query JavaScript for
the browser's window size, then calculate and set the CSS1 margins and font sizes
properties appropriately. 
<P> 
<LI><B>Dynamic fonts.</B> In the past, web page designers
were restricted from using different fonts (including international character sets)
because browsers could only display fonts found on the
user's system.  Elaborate workarounds (such as downloading huge images) have been tried,
but these have substantial drawbacks, such as long download times. Based on a W3C
proposal, dynamic fonts enable designers to use any font they desire; Navigator will
temporarily download that font with the page so it can be displayed using the exact font
the designer desired.  This enables a rich use of fonts, including international
characters such as Japanese kanji, on web pages that can be read by any Communicator
user. 
<P> 
<LI><B>Canvas mode.</B>  Developers can create true "kiosk" applications by
using JavaScript extensions to remove all "chrome" from the Navigator window (toolbars,
menus, scroll bars, or even window borders). User events such as keyboard input and
mouse activity can also be captured.  This enables Navigator 4.0 to support kiosked
applications like those already available in malls and airports. Note that to invoke
Canvas mode, the JavaScript must be appropriately signed and trusted to ensure security.
</UL>


<P> <LI><B>Object tag.</B>  Netscape Navigator 4.0 will support the W3C-sanctioned
Object tag for inserting applets and other data on HTML pages.

<P>

<LI><B>SmartUpdate and signing of plug-ins.</B> With SmartUpdate, users who encounter a
MIME-type for which they do not have the required plug-in can automatically download the
plug-in.  When users encounter a page requiring a plug-in to view or hear the content,
they are asked if they want to download the plug-in, agree to a license (optional), and
approve the installation based on whether or not they trust the signature of the
plug-in.  If the user agrees to all, the download proceeds and the embedded data is
correctly rendered.

<P>

<LI><B> SmartResume.</B>
 With SmartResume, interrupted downloads can be continued where they left off, rather than starting from the beginning. This saves users online time.


<P>

<LI> <B>Plug-in API 4.0.</B> The new plug-in API includes functionality for windowless,
transparent plug-ins. This new functionality will allow plug-ins to be integrated with
HTML layering capabilities to produce highly customized, openly extensible Web sites.
<P>

<LI><B>Extended access for signed Java applets.</B>  For security reasons, prior
versions of Navigator did not allow Java applets access to the local system.  In
Navigator 4.0, Java applets can securely request one of the following:

<UL> <P> <LI>limited disk access <LI>limited disk access and network usage <LI>limited
disk read access, unlimited disk write access <LI>unrestricted access </UL>

</UL> <P>

Users downloading an applet requesting any of the above privileges will be presented
with a dialog box outlining the requested access and presenting the applet's credentials
(its digital signature).  The user can then approve or not approve the applet's request.
 If the user does not approve the request, the applet can continue to run but cannot
perform the denied actions.

<UL>

<P>

<LI><B>Macromedia's Fireworks.</B> Web designers can deliver additional multimedia
capabilities through the Java-based API that simplifies text, image, animation and audio
manipulation.

<P> <LI> <B>Improved integration with OLE applications.</B>  In Windows 95 and NT,
Navigator can act as an OLE server or container, meaning Microsoft Office documents, for
example, can be viewed and edited within the Navigator window. Users can create
hyperlinks and view these documents just as easily as they can view HTML documents.

Netscape Navigator will include certain defaults that make it easier than ever to
communicate with others and create compelling, consistent content.

<UL> <P>

<LI><B>Unicode browsing.</B> Unicode is an international character-encoding standard
that supports many  languages.  With support for Unicode, Navigator users no longer have
to change encoding to view different languages, meaning users can create or view pages
that use characters from multiple languages (such as Cyrillic and Chinese). <P>

<LI><B>Standard default display window size.</B>  Prior versions of Navigator had
different default window sizes and margins on Windows, Macintosh, and Unix, making it
difficult for content designers to optimize pages to look consistent across platforms.
Navigator 4.0 will standardize the default window size and margins across all platforms.

Internet users have long known that there are many avenues through which to communicate.
 Email, discussion groups, and Web applications all play a part in creating an
integrated information community.  In the spirit of Communicator, Composer empowers all
users to transparently create richly formatted information regardless of the
communication vehicle they decide to use. Formerly the cornerstone of Netscape Navigator
Gold, the HTML authoring tool has now been moved into the core product so even more
users can benefit from rich communication via HTML.

<UL> <P> <LI><B>As familiar as a word processor.</B>  Netscape Composer has been
enhanced to hide the particulars of HTML and behave in a way familiar to word processor
users.  For example, in the past it was impossible to type multiple spaces in a row
because HTML ignores them, and a return resulted in skipping a line due to use of the
standard paragraph tag.  Netscape Composer now supports a single line feed when hitting
return as well as multiple spaces in a row - just the behavior anyone used to a standard
word processor would expect.

<P> <LI><B>Table column editing.</B>  Most HTML editors do not recognize table columns. 
This means users cannot select a column and alter the formatting of the column elements.
 Netscape Composer allows for manipulation and formatting of columns.

<P> <LI><B>Integration with Messenger and Collabra.</B>  Netscape Composer is the tool
used to create rich HTML messages in Messenger and Collabra. The Composer's powerful yet
easy-to-use interface can more effectively communicate with high-impact messages.
Whether creating Web pages, email, or discussion group postings, the editing
capabilities and interface are the same.

<P>

<LI><B>Image import.</B>  In Navigator Gold 3.0 inserted images retained their format.
Unfortunately, platform-specific image formats are not the image formats of the
Internet.  With Netscape Composer, users can now drag and drop native format images
(such as BMP, PICT, XBMP) from other applications or paste images from the clipboard
into a Composer document, and the image will automatically be converted into an Internet
standard image format.

<P>

<LI><B>Publishing enhancements.</B>  Netscape Navigator Gold 3.0 featured One-Button
Publish.  Netscape Composer continues to refine this feature, making it even easier to
use by allowing users to publish without being forced to save the document on the
local file system. Composer will also correctly set the default directory for publishing
so users can easily publish back to the directory where a page was found.

enabling all users in an information community to produce richly formatted content as

<LI><B>Spell-checking.</B> No editing tool is complete without spelling support, so
Netscape Composer includes an integrated spelling-checker.

<P>

<LI><B>Composer plug-in API.</B>  Netscape has exposed a Composer plug-in API that allows
customers and third-party developers to create plug-ins to customize or extend Composer.
Such plug-ins can manipulate the HTML page being edited and can be run automatically
when the document is published or sent. Some possible opportunities for plug-ins might
include an image editor, grammar checker, or thesaurus. </UL>

creates industry-standard HTML documents, messages written by Netscape Communicator
users can be viewed by anyone with a browser.

<B> C<FONT SIZE=-1>ONFERENCE:</FONT> C<FONT SIZE=-1>OMMUNICATE</FONT> W<FONT
SIZE=-1>ITH</FONT> A<FONT SIZE=-1>NYONE</FONT> </B><BR> Netscape Conference eliminates
the "first-telephone problem" of having nobody to talk to by supporting open,
international standards and providing multiplatform support for conferencing.

<UL>

<P> <LI><B>H.323 support.</B>  Netscape builds on its support for open standards by
implementing the H.323 standard for conferencing. Widespread industry support for the
International Telecommunications Union (ITU) H.323 standard provides interoperability
between other audio and videoconferencing products, PBX switches, multiuser bridges,
and other network-telephony endpoints. <P>

<LI><B>Platform and hardware independence.</B>  Mac, Windows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows
NT, and Unix versions of Netscape Conference are all interoperable, meaning users never
need to worry about the platform of the person they are calling.  In other words, it's as easy for a Windows 3.1 user in the planning department to call a designer who uses a
Mac as to call an engineer who uses a Unix box. <P>

<LI><B>Support for multiple codecs.</B>  While audio has to be compressed before it can
be sent across the network, there is not yet a  best form of audio compression for every
situation.  Conference's support for a wide array of standards-based audio codecs
(compression/decompression) assures users that they will always get the highest-quality
sound. The Setup Wizard and autonegotiation during the call automatically select the
optimal codec based on hardware capabilities and available bandwidth.

<P>

<LI><B>Leverage existing network infrastructure.</B>  Netscape Conference does not
require changes to users' existing network infrastructure to operate.  Built on the
TCP/IP standard, Conference does not require that users' networks be upgraded to support
emerging technologies such as RSVP or multicast.

Managing software installation and configuration is all about helping IS reduce their cost of software ownership by providing enhanced
administration capabilities, guidelines, and tools to reduce support calls. AutoAdmin works by having Communicator query a central, server-side configuration file (created with Mission Control) during launch. The configuration file contains JavaScript instructions for client preference
information as well as software download instructions. Setup and administration of
AutoAdmin requires use of the administration tools contained in Netscape Mission Control. For an extensive list of what IS administrators can control
with Mission Control, please refer to its Feature Guide. <BR>
