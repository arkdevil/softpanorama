They're not *about* either.  Being a commercial concern, they're *about*
making money, as are Sun, HP, IBM, Compaq, Dell, DG, Amdahl, Gateway,
SGI, DEC etc. etc.

Since they exist to make money, they can hardly be blamed for working
out the most effective way to do it and sticking to it.  If everybody
*insists* on jumping into bed with them (as pretty much everyone does to
at least some extent) they're hardly going to say, "no no, OS/2's better
than 95, you should develop for that" or something similar, are they?

IBM used to be about "nobody got fired for buying IBM", and they
sucked.  Since the mystique was broken, their products have got much
better.  Let's just hope this happens with MS, so people can buy their
good products (they have several) on merit and ignore their bad ones
(they have several) as dogs, just like every other company.
