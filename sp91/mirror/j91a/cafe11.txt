I believe you are right and it has taken us too long to come up with an update 
of Visual Cafe and Visual Cafe Pro with JDK 1.1 support.  The reason we could 
get Cafe with JDK 1.1 out so quickly was mainly because the environment itself 
doesn't use Java.  Visual Cafe and Visual Cafe Pro actually run Java 
components at design time for supporting layout management, etc...

For whatever internal reason, I think we have failed to provide asap support 
for the latest JDKs like we used to in the last year or so.  On behalf of the 
team, I apologize for this, and assure you that we are looking very closely at 
the reasons why this has happened, and are taking steps to make sure that we 
provide update releases in a much more frequent and timely manner, especially 
in regards to the support of newer and better versions of the JDK.

The good news is that Visual Cafe with 1.1 support preview was posted on the 
Update Center (cafe.symantec.com) today!  Visual Cafe Pro will be posted 
within the next 10 days as well.

Please let us know about any problem that you encounter, as we want to make 
sure that we deal with it.

Sorry for the delay -- Regards,
