So it's a bug in either javakey or Communicator. Without more information
it's not possible to tell which (perhaps you could post the manifest file,
or put it on the web?)

Why the conspiracy theories? Netscape has no motive for doing this
deliberately; they were involved with designing the manifest spec (I was
one of the contributors when I was working there).

It did the last time I looked (in PR2). It isn't a good idea to rely on
that always being true, however. CLASSPATH is intended for applications
(and that is how most users configure it). I would much prefer that a
different setting was used for browser extensions.
