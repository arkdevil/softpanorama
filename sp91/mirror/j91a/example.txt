	A good deployed example of this is the Chicago Tribune's
Metromix Arts and Entertainment site (www.metromix.com).  It
uses OrbixWeb, Jeeves (Sun's Java Based Web Server), and 
ObjectStore on the back end.  I believe that STR (who built the
site with The Leap Partnership) wrote all of the code behind the
site in Java and IDL.

	We have several other customers integrating CORBA and Java
ObjectStore, but they are still in the development phase or have not
announced their products yet.

mailto:metromix@tribune.com for more information.
