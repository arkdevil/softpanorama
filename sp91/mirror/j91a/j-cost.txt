If this were indeed true, then industry would long ago have embraced Smalltalk
as the obvious solution - it's well defined, portable across platforms
and pretty open.  But that's not actually what's seen as important.

(And while I have used Smalltalk as my example <after all, I DO
work for ParcPlace ;-) >, the same thing goes for almost any other 
language - Eiffel, Lisp, et. al.)

Bad as C++ is (and yes, I will describe it that way), it had one very
large thing going for it - it looked like (and still looks like) C, 
a very standard and widely used language.  Guess what Java also has going 
for it ?  Looks like C, has a simlified (from the standpoint of C++)
object model.  Still has basic, primitive data types at the bottom,
meaning that a C programmer can start out in very familar territory.

Which is important, as there are SCADS of C programmers out there, and
management can easily justify the 'minimal' expense of training them in Java
(after all, it LOOKS like C !).  Thus, contract and non-contract developers
of C (and Java) are cheaper than are similar resources for other
development environments.

This is a large part of the reason that C like and Basic like development
toolsets break into the mainstream of development faster than do other 
alternatives - they look mre familiar, and are accepted more easily.


Technical merit ends up having very little to do with the end game.
