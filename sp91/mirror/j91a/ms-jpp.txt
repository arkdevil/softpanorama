I've been working on a Java app.  
I've been using Cafe, JDK, and J++.
If I compile with JDK javac and run with JDK java and JDK classes then no
problem.
If I compile with Symantec and run with JDK java and JDK classes then no
problem.
If I compile with J++ and run with JDK java and JDK classes then JDK java
generates GPF and dies like a pig.

J++ AWT classes require other MS specific classes that are not present when
running under JDK environment.  If I compile with J++ then I'm locked into
using the Microsoft VM and runtiem environment.  

End of story.
