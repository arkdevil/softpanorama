Netscape includes some limited script callability-from-Java in their
third and fourth generation implementations, but unless you can count on
your users having Netscape software, it's probably not worth it.

IMHO better, usually, is including a method in your applet that makes
the new values available, and a script that polls them and handles the
field update. It's just always easier to call Java from JS than vice
versa.

I've been beating my head out on this recently, and that's what I've
come up with. If you must call backwards, in NN >=3.0 you can
showDocument() a "javascript:" protocol URL, or use a call() method
(documented on the Netscape web LiveDocument pages).

If you find out anything more, please let us all know.
